1,7XGW-HR20-Y9NK-P1SJ-00000-00.txt,"Over 100 House Democrats including nine committee chairmen have signed on to legislation that would require President Obama to submit a plan to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and other trade deals. The Trade Reform, Accountability, Development and Employment (TRADE) Act of 2009 calls on the president to submit a plan to address through renegotiations gaps between existing deals, as well as benchmarks Congress would set on various issues. It would establish a congressional ""super committee,"" to be chaired by the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committee chairmen, to formulate the plan. It also calls for a new ""fast-track"" law that would require Congress to vote in favor of a new trade agreement before the president offers his signature. Backers of the bill, including primary sponsor Rep. Mike Michaud (D-Maine), described it as ""consistent with what the president said he would do before he was elected."" During last year's presidential campaign, Obama said he would consider pulling the U.S. out of NAFTA. Since his election, Obama has called for tougher labor and environmental rules to be included in the deal, which covers the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The new trade legislation is similar to a 2008 bill, but that measure attracted only 74 co-sponsors and did not make it out of committee. The rising number of co-sponsors on the legislation reflects both the larger Democratic majority in the House and increasing skepticism about trade amid a global ***recession**. It also underlines questions about when three trade deals completed by the Bush administration might receive votes in Congress. Those agreements are with Panama, Colombia and South Korea. Only two Republicans have signed on as co-sponsors: Reps. Walter Jones of North Carolina and Chris Smith of New Jersey. The Democratic chairmen who are co-sponsors are Robert Brady (Pa.) of House Administration; John Conyers Jr. (Mich.) of Judiciary; Bob Filner (Calif.) of Veterans' Affairs; Bart Gordon (Tenn.) of Science and Technology; Jim Oberstar (Minn.) of Transportation; Collin Peterson (Minn.) of Agriculture; Nick Rahall (W.Va.) of Natural Resources; John Spratt (S.C.) of Budget; and Louise Slaughter (N.Y.) of Rules. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) will introduce accompanying legislation in the Senate, Michaud said. Lawmakers cited a number of issues in arguing for the legislation, from concerns that imported food is not safe to environmental issues, workers' rights and a need to combat job loss. Existing policies on international trade ""have been anything but beneficial to our workers and our businesses,"" Rep. Betty Sutton (D-Ohio) said. ""There are those out there who will accuse us of being anti-trade,"" Sutton said. ""But we are in favor of trade that is fair and balanced and will work with our businesses and workers -and not against them by leaving them at an unfair disadvantage."" International trade has plunged in the wake of the ***recession**. The World Bank predicted this week that global trade would drop by 10 percent this year, and that developing countries would be particularly hard-hit.",0,,,
2,4PXT-FDC0-TX4N-D1HK-00000-00.txt,"Union heads, public officials and business leaders plan to mount a renewed campaign this fall to convince Congress to spend billions of dollars more on maintaining and upgrading the nation's infrastructure.Lobbyists argue the Minneapolis bridge collapse presents a tragic case study of the potential consequences of ignoring infrastructure needs. However, these groups acknowledge that finding money to pay for the upgrades could still be politically difficult.One method, raising the gas tax and other ""user fees,"" has support in some quarters, but it also faces significant opposition, including from President Bush.Rep. Jim Oberstar (D-Minn.), the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, plans to open the debate Wednesday with a hearing on his proposal to increase the gas tax by 5 cents to provide an infusion of cash.Much of the lobbying effort will be directed at making such a move more politically palatable.""There is tremendous political pressure not to raise the gas tax, and it's not just coming from Republicans,"" said Steve Sandherr, CEO of the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC).Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) has said he opposes a gas tax. A spokeswoman said Baucus is committed nevertheless to finding more money to repair ""structurally deficient"" bridges in the United States, a designation given to a quarter of the nearly 600,000 spans in the country, including the 35W bridge that collapsed in August.The gas tax hasn't been raised since 1993. Advocates of a hike argue that its purchasing power has depleted by as much as 30 percent as a result of inflation and the growing costs of the materials to build bridges and roads.There is evidence that the debate has shifted in light of the tragic bridge collapse and other infrastructure breakdowns like the explosion of a steam pipe in New York City.""There is a growing understanding that these issues need to be addressed sooner rather than later,"" said Pete Ruane, the president and CEO of the American Road and Transportation Builders Association.He said the budget crunch is projected to grow in 2009, when a decline in user fees is expected to leave a $4 billion shortfall. That sum is the estimated gap between what Congress authorized in the 2005 surface transportation bill and the resources that will actually be available in the trust fund that finances road and bridge work. The 2005 bill directed $218.6 billion in money for roads and bridges and transit systems over five years.One consequence of the renewed effort could be a change in how the federal government participates in federal infrastructure funding.Sens. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) and Chris Dodd (D-Conn.), for instance, introduced a bill, the National Infrastructure Back Act of 2007, to create a new funding mechanism relying in part on contributions from the private sector.Sens. John Thune (R-S.D.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) are crafting another measure that would use more private equity to pay for large-capital projects.For advocates, the bills represent a welcome sign that the political winds have shifted.""There is an acknowledgement of the need,"" said Janet Kavinoky, the director of transportation infrastructure at the Chamber of Commerce.Kavinoky is also the executive director of the Americans for Transportation Mobility, which includes a number of business and labor groups.The bridge collapse has served as an ""unpleasant reminder of the infrastructure crisis that we face,"" said Sandherr of the AGC.The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) estimates as much as $1.6 trillion is needed over the next five years to bring infrastructure to good working order.Brian Pallasch, lobbyist for ASCE, said as much as one-half or two-thirds of that money gets appropriated from federal and state budget coffers.""That leaves you a pretty significant gap,"" Pallasch said.The ASCE has given the country's infrastructure a D grade. Funding for bridges and roads alone is estimated to be some $40 billion a year short of the need.Complicating the lobbying push could be fallout from the negative publicity surrounding congressional earmarks. In speaking out against an increase in the gas tax, Bush noted that Congress should change how it spends taxpayer money instead of trying to get more of it.The 2005 highway bill came under criticism for its more than 6,000 earmarks. Oberstar's measure tries to avoid that fight by prohibiting earmarks. It also sets up a firewall so that the money is not siphoned off into general fund revenues and used to pay for projects other than infrastructure.Two big business groups, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, are stepping up their own lobbying efforts to increase money available for infrastructure, noting the economic costs of bad bridges and roads and traffic congestion.Kavinoky said she prepared a $1 million Chamber budget for the campaign but was told by President and CEO Thomas Donohue, who was the former head of the American Trucking Associations, to come back with a more aggressive campaign.""Part of our job is to create the environment to educate the public on what is needed, and create the public will to do what is necessary,"" Kavinoky said.""It's an issue of people understanding, 'What do I get for it,'"" said Sandherr of AGC.Advocates also hope whatever momentum there is for spending more on bridges and roads will transfer to other infrastructure efforts, like the Water Resources Development Act and a bill to up aviation user fees to pay for a new air traffic control system better able to handle increases in air traffic.",0,,,
3,7WY0-K2D1-2PG5-50MG-00000-00.txt,"In awarding this year s Nobel Prize in economics, the judges looked outside traditional areas of research. The winners, both Americans, are Elinor Ostrom, a political scientist at Indiana University, and Oliver E. Williamson, a professor of business, economics and law who retired five years ago from the University of California, Berkeley. Both were surprised to win; evidently, most people in the economics profession shared their surprise.Ms. Ostrom and Mr. Williamson were honored for work, beginning in the 1970s, that looked beyond markets for an understanding of economic forces. Ms. Ostrom examined natural resources held in common, such as water or forests. Her research challenged an insight sometimes called  the tragedy of the commons,  which holds that, absent private ownership or a central regulating authority, individuals will plunder a resource until it is depleted. (The classic example, from earlier centuries, is overgrazing on a village commons.) Ms. Ostrom found instead that people dependent on a common resource are likely to protect it by coming up with shared rules for its use.Mr. Williamson looked at large corporations and their internal governance. He found that decision-making was often more efficient when kept within the company than when given over to the marketplace or central government authorities. Like Ms. Ostrom, he discovered ways in which people minimized conflict and developed problem-solving networks without the intrusion of the state.In their citation, the Nobel judges noted that economics should look past market theory to the world of actual behavior, something most students of Economics 101 could probably appreciate. Partly, the prize appears a response to the recent global ***financial crisis**, which demonstrated the limits of relying solely on notions of marketplace efficiency. But it is also an evident nod toward breaking down barriers in the social sciences, which increasingly overlap. Ms. Ostrom s selection in itself broke new ground: She is the first woman to receive the economics prize since it was established, in 1969.Perhaps this year s prize will encourage more young women to study economics, more economists to study psychology and more sociologists to explore the ways of Wall Street and Washington.",0,,,
4,7WG6-5JB0-Y9NR-M01D-00000-00.txt,"    When he was 12, Chad Griffin often rode his bike near the family home on Baxter Road, clutching a fishing rod on his handlebars en route to Cheney Lake, where he would coax a few rainbow trout from the shallow waters. Those fish didn't stand a chance.   Neither did the fish of Lake Oneida in Syracuse, N.Y., last week. The 1995 East High graduate, now living in Texas, caught 20 bass weighing 65 pounds, 10 ounces on the final stop of the Bassmaster Elite Tournament Circuit to win the event and take home $101,000.  Along the way, he fulfilled a dream he had cherished since he first watched the ""Bassmasters"" television program as an 8-year-old. ""It's the NASCAR of bass fishing, you can't go any higher,"" Griffin, 32, said by phone on Friday from his father's home in Granbury, Texas.  ""Can it get any better?  Absolutely not. And you never think it's going to happen."" The victory marked the first time an angler who grew up in Alaska captured a Bassmaster event, and it came on Griffin's last chance to remain on the circuit. Competing is expensive, especially for a rookie like Griffin without major sponsors. Entry fees are $5,500 for a single tournament, $41,800 for the season, with gas, lodging and other expenses on top of that.  Until last week, Griffin's prospects looked dismal. His average finish in five previous tournaments was 59th. ""Here is a young man on a shoestring operation down to his last tournament, knowing if he did not make a good showing he was done in -- and he won the thing,"" his dad, Gene Griffin, wrote in an e-mail.Alaska anglers can earn cash at such tournaments as the Homer Jackpot Halibut Derby, the Seward Silver Salmon Derby and the Ship Creek King Salmon Derby. But the prize money -- and fame -- is considerably less that what the Bassmasters tournaments offer. Seward's top angler earned $10,000 and Homer's derby, Alaska's richest, paid California angler Jeff Pardi $45,475 last year for his 348-pound flatfish. Those contests are not a draw for professionals and winners never appear on national TV. Neither smallmouth nor largemouth bass were available to Griffin growing up in Alaska; Washington state and British Columbia are the closest places with bass. As a kid, the only bass Griffin encountered were in magazines or on televised fishing programs. He sharpened his fishing chops chasing salmon, rainbow trout and Dolly Varden on the Kenai Peninsula once school ended each spring. ""My grandparents used to drive up every summer, and my grandma dumped us down there on the water,""  he said.  Popular Kenai Peninsula waterways such as the Anchor and Ninlichik rivers and Deep Creek became familiar. ""I had my fishing friends and my school friends,"" he said.  Among the latter was Trajan Langdon, the first Alaskan to play in the NBA and a teammate on the East baseball team. Among the former was fellow T-Bird Austin Klassen, now an electrician in Las Vegas. ""He's always been good at it,"" Klassen said by phone. ""He's like a doctor on the water. A surgeon can tell you what's going on with your body; he can tell you what's going on with the fish."" Klassen grew up fishing with Griffin, but never quite matched his passion. ""The guy could fish forever,"" Klassen said. ""After eight hours, I would be ready to go in and he'd say, 'I'll drop you off at the hotel' and he'd be back out there.  ""He was patient, always under control, and I think that served him well. I'm the short-fused one."" In the New York tournament, Griffin outlasted a final-round field that included one of his bass fishing idols, Louisiana's Greg Hackney, who Griffin watched fish on television as a youngster.  His parents worked in the oil industry and returned to Texas after Griffin finished high school. His mother, no fan of winter, was happy to see him finally graduate. ""The day after graduation, we were on a plane,"" he said. It was in Texas 10 years ago that Griffin caught his first largemouth bass, along the banks of Lake Granbury.  Last year, he fished all the Bassmaster Invitational tournaments and performed well enough to qualify for the Elite Series. But by then, the stock ***market downturn** cost Griffin and his family much of their savings, forcing his parents -- who had retired and were supporting him -- back to work. The money was running out.  ""I decided to go for broke,"" said Griffin, whose previous best in the Elite Series was 32nd place. ""I knew I didn't have the money to continue competitive fishing next year. Even if I had finished the tournament in second place (earning $25,000), it would have been the end of my fishing career. The first-prize check will pay a lot of bills.""  It could also open a few sponsorship doors. Regardless, he'll never lose his love of bass fishing.  ""It's more about the hunt than anything,"" he said. ""You got to figure them out. It's the challenge of figuring out something you can't see."" Reach Mike Campbell at mcampbell@adn.com or 257-4329.

5,4V2R-VRT0-TWJV-9121-00000-00.txt,"Lt. Gov. Diane Denish's news conference Wednesday at Eldorado Hotel lasted just 4 minutes and19 seconds.She didn't reveal anything unexpected, didn't announce any new plans for when she takes over the governorship from Bill Richardson next year. In a way, she didn't need to.Her quick appearance was the start of a new chapter in New Mexico history, a span that will last longer then any one press conference. Much longer.Denish, 59, could become the state's longest-serving consecutive-term governor, if the Democrat can win election to the post in 2010 and re-election in 2014.If she thought about that as she spoke to reporters in front of the Christmas tree in the lobby of the downtown Santa Fe hotel, she didn't let on.Instead, Denish gave a nod to Richardson's impending move to the U.S. Commerce Department, agreed to answer just a few short questions about her move up the state government ladder and headed back into a three-day conference of other lieutenant governors being held at the swanky hotel.""It's a wonderful opportunity for the governor, it's a great opportunity for New Mexico, and it's a wonderful opportunity for the Obama administration to have him be part of their team.""""The governor I think is uniquely qualified as the economic diplomat,"" she said. ""He's been a great job creator in New Mexico.""Denish said she spoke to Richardson on Monday and planned to meet with him early today. She said she's not concentrating on the day she takes over, but rather the days leading up to that point.""My first order of business is to ensure a smooth transition and work closely with the Governor's Office so that we're doing everything we can over the next few weeks so there's no interruption in good government.""When she assumes her new role -- sometime early next year after Obama is sworn in and Richardson is confirmed by the U.S. Senate -- Denish will know what to do.She has run the executive branch on and off for the past two years while Richardson campaigned for president.Richardson will stay on the job until at least Jan. 20, when he is scheduled to give the state of the state address in front of the Legislature on the opening day of the 2009 session.He said in a statement Wednesday that he's still working on the upcoming 60-day session here, and the decision to take the new job was tough. ""This is by no means an easy decision and brings with it a mix of emotions,"" he stated. ""I am proud of what we have accomplished in New Mexico during the past six years and we're not done yet.""Richardson, who first won office here in 1982 when he was elected to represent Northern New Mexico in Congress, said he'll miss the state.With Denish moving up a notch comes a competition for her current spot. She gets to pick her own successor as lieutenant governor for the next two years, subject to the confirmation of the state Senate.Rep. Lucky Varela, D-Santa Fe, said Wednesday that he's interested in the post but hasn't talked to Denish about it yet. ""My interest would be to serve out the remainder of the term and then open it up to anybody who wants to run for the primary,"" he said.""I think I could offer some resolution to some of the issues we have in terms of accountability,"" said Varela, who in 2006 ran briefly for state treasurer.Other names being floated are State Auditor Hector Balderas; Lawrence Rael, executive director of the Mid-Regional Council of Governments; and state Sen. Gerald Ortiz y Pino, D-Albuquerque.While new people arrive, others undoubtedly will be leaving.A Richardson spokesman didn't return a call seeking comment on who might be heading to Washington with the governor.Denish's six-year partnership with Richardson has been prickly at times, but she has remained an active advocate for administration policies.At the same time, she has built up her own network of support that has fueled a fundraising effort netting more than $1.3 million for her gubernatorial campaign.She will take over at a difficult time. State government is struggling to cope with the ***economic downturn**, pondering cuts even as pressure mounts to do something about health care and shore up the school system.Some lawmakers expect Denish to bring a different, more communicative style to the job, and perhaps a slightly different focus on issues.""I hope -- I think -- that she will care about and pay more attention to women's issues. É I know that she cares about women's reproductive health and pay equity,"" said Rep. Mimi Stewart, D-Albuquerque, a veteran lawmaker who heads the House Health and Government Affairs Committee.The relationship between Denish and Richardson got chillier after she was quoted in the Albuquerque Journal in December 2005 about the governor's ""irritating and annoying"" habit of poking, prodding and touching her in public.

6,4TH6-7CW0-TX12-N0KV-00000-00.txt,"c(""Sep. 21--One of the ways in which The High Point Enterprise tries to make the news more useful and meaningful to readers is by attempting to bring major stories from North Carolina, across the national and around the world home to you. The newspaper tried to do that much of last week with Paul Johnson's stories -- telling you about local reaction and the impact locally -- on what most analysts describe as the worst ***financial crisis** in decades.The U.S. government took some unprecedented, extremely costly steps day after day last week, perhaps the most significant being the government \""seeking the power to rescue banks by buying distressed assets at the heart of the financial system's crisis that has brought down Wall Street giants Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns,\"" as The Associated Press described it.President Bush declared that \""America's economy is facing unprecedented challenges\"" and \""We're responding with unprecedented measures\"" while calling this \""a pivotal moment for America's economy\"" and insisting that \""government intervention is not only warranted, it is essential.\""Recognize this program \""to buy up bad mortgages and other toxic debt,\"" as an AP reporter described it could cost taxpayers -- see how easily and quickly this story can be brought to the local level in general and you in particular? -- hundreds of billions of dollars. Hoping to make you feel better about it, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson declared \""this bold approach will cost American families far less than the alternative -- a continuing series of financial institution failures and frozen credit markets unable to fund economic expansion.\""While it's tough for taxpayers to stomach the philosophy that they are \""rewarding\"" rather than punishing those institutions whose leaders and workers performed miserably and contributed to a phenomenal financial foul-up. As Bush, Paulson and others at the helm attest, this may be our only choice. Granted, the federal government temporarily banned short-selling of 799 financial stocks -- the practice of betting against those stocks -- for two weeks. That should help calm the waters a bit but is merely a drop in the proverbial bucket.It did get immediate favorable response, with both Wall Street and Asian stock markets soaring. Taxpayers' best hopes at this time are (1) that this is a one-time salvage effort, (2) that it is temporary and (3) that much more stringent oversight of financial practices are forthcoming quickly.Taxpayers didn't cause the problem.

Charlotte, N.C., was the only metro area to register an increase, up 1.8 percent.Overall, prices in the 20 cities fell nearly 11 percent in January from a year earlier, the biggest drop in the index's two-decade history.\""Unfortunately, it does not look like early 2008 is marking any turnaround in the housing market, after the declining year recorded through 2007,\"" said David M. Blitzer, chairman of Standard &amp; Poor's index committee, in a statement. \""Home prices continue to fall, decelerate and reach record lows across the nation.\""Prices have fallen month to month for five straight months in all 20 cities tracked by the index. And the declines are getting steeper, with 13 of the 20 cities reporting their biggest single monthly decline in January.In San Diego, the index is off 21.1 percent from the all-time peak set in June 2006. In the previous local downturn in the early 1990s, San Diego's monthly year-over-year declines never reached the double-digit rate, Case-Schiller's research shows.Case-Schiller also looked at how housing values have held up in three tiers roughly representing the low, middle and high portions of each market.In San Diego, the lowest tier -- covering homes sold for less than $420,873 -- saw the biggest drop from the peak, down 28.6 percent.The mid-priced tier, from $420,873 to $629,470, has dropped 23.1 percent, while the top-priced tier has fallen 14.6 percent from the peak.Peter Dennehy, senior vice president of the San Diego-based Sullivan Group Real Estate Advisors, said the prices dropped the most in the lowest-priced housing tier because that was where first-time buyers most often used the subprime loans that are now resetting at unaffordable interest rates.Despite the grim news, Dennehy noted that for most homeowners who bought before 2004, their homes are still worth more than they paid.\""For most people, this is just a small story,\"" he said.Dennehy estimated that 50,000 homes were sold per year from 2004 to 2007, and it is those owners who may be \""upside down,\"" as real estate insiders put it, with mortgages worth more than the homes.\""It is not an insignificant number, but not all those people are in distress,\"" Dennehy said. \""I think the percentage of total mortgages in the county that are in some level of distress is still well under 10 percent.\""He predicted that prices will continue falling and called that a welcome sign for a market that rose so rapidly in recent years.\""Definitely, there are some real bargains out there, and not just in condo conversions anymore,\"" Dennehy said. \""Now you can buy in some neighborhoods where you can start to be able to buy detached homes in the $300,000s and $400,000s. We have not seen prices like that for a while. Even in some pretty nice neighborhoods, $500,000s and $600,000s are not unheard-of price points.\""The Associated Press contributed to this report.To see more of The San Diego Union-Tribune, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.uniontrib.com.

8,7X64-KD00-Y9J0-Y0CR-00000-00.txt,"c(""Nov. 27--Discretionary spending has been shrinking along with home equity in the aftermath of the real estate crash.Money that used to be spent on dinner and a movie now increasingly is stashed in a savings account or used to pay bills.That's left restaurants and entertainment venues scrambling for strategies to convince ***recession**-weary consumers to splurge on a night out.Friends were nervous for Russell Johnson when he founded Firehouse, a massive firefighter-themed restaurant, bar, arcade and billiards place that opened in southwest Bakersfield in March.\""I got a lot of: 'Are you crazy?' and 'What are you thinking?'\"" he said. \""My thought process was if you're providing a good value to the consumer every day, they'll still come.\""Dangling an incentive here and there can't hurt, either.Firehouse recently introduced \""parents eat free\"" nights on Tuesdays, a twist on the more common \""kids eat free\"" offered by many family diners. How effective that will be, Johnson said, remains to be seen. \""We haven't pushed it too hard,\"" he said. \""People are still finding out about it.\""Entertainment spending increased 5.1 percent from 2007 to 2008 nationally, but had risen at more than twice that rate -- 13.6 percent -- between 2006 and 2007, according to the Consumer Expenditure Survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So everyone's after fewer dollars.Cafe Med, which has been in business for 19 years, has witnessed several ***economic downturn**s, but this one is the worst, said owner Meir Brown.\""Fortunately, we're doing alright,\"" he said. \""We're one of the fortunate ones, but our business is down about 25 percent over the last three years. There's no way you don't notice that.\""La Mina Cantina restaurant in northeast Bakersfield also is feeling the pinch. \""The bar is compensating for what we're losing on the dining room right now,\"" manager Luis Luevano said.The restaurant hasn't laid anyone off, but downsized its staff through natural attrition and adjusted the hours of employees who remain. It's also advertising more and stepping up promotions such as happy hour seven days a week.Not giving upPromotions are the main strategy of the Downtown Business Association, too. Its members include restaurants, retailers and art galleries.\""We're not just sitting back and giving up,\"" said association president Cathy Butler. \""We're trying to give people a reason to come downtown. When we have special events like First Fridays and the Christmas parade and so on, our businesses always do better, so we're looking at making the area an experience rather than a single destination. It's not only about the restaurants but art exhibits and concerts and all sorts of other things you can do before or after you go out to eat.\""The association's newest enticement specifically targets holiday shoppers. People who ride the downtown trolley five times can enter a drawing for a $100 shopping spree this month. In December, the value of the shopping spree jumps to $500.Los Angeles restaurant consultant James Sinclair isn't a fan of costly gimmicks. \""When you start offering deals that are too good to be true, that are unsustainable, eventually you go out of business,\"" he said.A better strategy is to identify a unique niche and do a really good job of providing something that consumers can't get anywhere else, Sinclair said.Some see the ***recession** as an opportunity.Johnson, who had an extensive career in construction before opening Firehouse, used the economy as leverage to negotiate favorable lease terms and discounts with building contractors.Looking at tourism differentlyBakersfield tourism has dipped a bit, judging from taxes on hotel stays. Transient occupancy tax revenue collected by the city of Bakersfield fell 4.2 percent between the 2005-06 fiscal year and 2008-09.But that's not nearly as bad as the decline in some cities, according to the Greater Bakersfield Convention and Visitors Bureau.\""We've never been an iconic travel destination in the same way as a place like San Francisco or Disneyland, so you can't miss what you never had,\"" said bureau manager Don Cohen.Even in a ***recession**, though, sports leagues have their state finals and organizations hold regional conferences, Cohen said.\""At a time when companies and organizations are being criticized for ritzy meetings in places like Las Vegas, we can say, 'Come here. Nobody will question it. It won't be controversial, and it won't cost a lot,'\"" he said.The Kern County Board of Trade also is capitalizing on the ***recession** to market the Central Valley's outdoor recreation opportunities. Kern is inexpensive, driving distance from major cities is quick and it's a \""thrill-seeker paradise,\"" the board touts on its website.Aggressive outreachBakersfield Museum of Art says its traffic is actually up this year, probably because adult admission is a relatively painless $5, and that was reduced to $1 in July and August to lure visitors out of air-conditioned homes when temperatures soared.Admission also is free every third Friday of the month.In addition to free or low ticket prices, executive director Bernie Herman credits the surge in museum attendance to aggressive outreach through e-mail blasts and podcasts on its website and YouTube, as well as on-site lectures.\""We're doing everything we can to open the museum up to as many people as possible,\"" Herman said. Yet even as paid admissions have doubled year-over-year, the museum is facing a 25 percent reduction in donations and grants, Herman said.\""We won't let it affect the quality of our programs or the number of exhibits,\"" he said. \""We just cut staff hours, do whatever we have to do.\""To see more of The Bakersfield Californian, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.bakersfield.com.

9,4S3W-MXM0-TW8F-G0N5-00000-00.txt,"Mike Liang earns the equivalent of $37,500 a year, owns a four-bedroom apartment and can afford to send his two daughters to English tutorial schools.   Like other employees at the Hsinchu Science Park, Mr. Liang, a marketing manager for a semiconductor company, is the envy of many on this island, where average annual salaries stagnate at around $17,000 and high property prices keep many married couples living with their parents.   But what is on Mr. Liang's mind and that of many others in Taiwan's high-technology industry is how it can maintain success amid growing competition from neighbors, including China and South Korea, and global price declines in products like laptop computers. The slower growth rate in sales of some high-tech goods and the  ***economic downturn** in the United States are also worries.   Many industry workers and analysts say the greatest economic challenge for Taiwan and its 23 million people is overcoming its reliance on manufacturing for other brands and focusing on innovation and building its own brands.   ''We have to transform ourselves,'' Mr. Liang said during a lunch break. ''Otherwise, our costs will keep going up and companies will move to China and Vietnam.''   High-tech products accounted for 70 percent of the island's 2007 exports. Taiwan is the world's largest supplier of notebook PCs, and liquid-crystal-display panels for flat-screen televisions, according to the government.   Two of the world's biggest contract microchip makers are based in Taiwan -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Companyand the United Microelectronics Corporation -- and their foundries, the world's two biggest, are based in the science park, one of three on the island.    The Hsinchu Science Park was opened in December 1980, Southern Taiwan Science Park in 1996 and the Central Taiwan Science Park in 2003. The Hsinchu Science Park is home to 440 companies and is where most of Taiwan's top high-tech manufacturers are based.  But profit margins for many of the companies in the park have been narrowing. Some have moved production to China, while others are considering relocation to Vietnam for lower costs on labor and production.   ''Back in 1999 and 2000, these companies enjoyed quite healthy profit margins,'' said Ming-Kai Cheng, regional head of technology research for CLSA, a leading Asia research, brokerage and investment group. ''Now the number of companies in profit stage has dropped.''   Revenue growth at Taiwan semiconductor companies, for example, has fallen to single digits from double digits. A main reason is what Mr. Cheng calls the ''me, too'' mentality, or too many Taiwan companies doing the same thing.   ''A lot of companies think if you're going to make something profitable, I'm going to make the same thing slightly less profitable,'' Mr. Cheng said.   About 50 percent of the companies in the Hsinchu Science Park carry out semiconductor manufacturing, design or related work, with revenue from the sector comprising 71 percent of the park's total revenue.   Taiwan companies are also largely focused on making products for global brands like Dell, Apple and Intel, instead of coming up with their own brands, and they focus on hardware manufacturing, where only a small percentage of the price the consumer pays for a product is earned.   As little as 5 percent of the consumer price for a product like a laptop can be earned by the Taiwan companies that assemble them, while a higher percentage -- about 20 percent -- is earned by contract manufacturers, also known as original equipment manufacturers, or O.E.M.'s -- which make chips or other parts for the brand holders, according to industry estimates.   With their own brands, the companies could earn as much as 30 percent of the consumer value of a product, analysts estimate.  Transformations are nothing new for an island that has evolved from an agriculture- and textile-dominated society after World War II to a factory for light industrial and labor intensive products like sneakers in the 1960s and 1970s to an electronics production base in the 1990s and now to a high-tech center.  Huang Der-Ray, director general of the Hsinchu Science Park Administration, said companies in the park had  increased spending on research and development from 4 percent of total revenue in previous years to 7 percent in the last three years.   Companies have also begun to focus on innovation and building their own brands. Mediatek, a chip design company that initially focused on optical storage drivers' chips, has ventured into other areas, including designing chips for wireless communications and high-definition digital televisions. The company is one of the most profitable in the science park and is considered a pioneer in its designs.  Several companies have focused on research into new technologies, including solar energy,  Mr. Huang said. One, Gintech Energy, has been successful in designing solar panels, which it sells to power companies around the world.   More companies are also moving toward design instead of just manufacturing. A decade ago, only about 20 or 30 companies in the Hsinchu Science Park were chip design companies, with most being contract manufacturers. Now, there are 80 companies whose focus is  design, Mr. Huang said.  Analysts said  a  challenge that Taiwan companies faced in developing a global brand was  overcoming the label-consciousness of consumers, who prefer internationally recognized brands rather than domestically designed products. Other than Acer and ASUS, which are Taiwan laptop brands, few of the island's high-tech products are known around the world, unlike the situation in South Korea.   Workers like Mr. Liang, while worried, say they  think that Taiwan can  again find a way to engineer am economic miracle.   ''I'm optimistic,'' he said, while adding that  ''to compete, Taiwan has to invest a lot of money.   ''Some of it has to come from the government. That's the only way to compete with the big companies overseas.''",0,,,
10,7VBX-XWW0-Y8T5-Y4W8-00000-00.txt,"CALLISTOBy Torsten KrolHarper Perennial. 437 pp. Paperback, $14.99People around the world got their hands on Torsten Krol's dark, goofy novel almost two years before readers in America, which isn't entirely fair since it's about us. This satire of the war on terror might have cut a little deeper during the surge, before our war president retired to Dallas and the ***recession** eclipsed Iraq. But ""Callisto"" is still a witty sendup of the anxieties that make Americans so dangerous, and ultimately it's barbed with enough tragedy to sting.The author is something of a mystery, allegedly an Australian who refuses all interviews. He claims to have raised a family in the United States before his divorce, which sent him into a fit of depression that inspired this tale of America's terrorism paranoia. The novel's success rests on the rambly voice of its hilariously clueless narrator, a large 21-year-old hayseed from Wyoming named Odell Deefus. People ""most likely think I'm a tall dumb hick but they would be wrong about that,"" Odell says by way of introduction. ""I know this because I have read 'The Yearling' sixteen times now, and that is a Pulitzer Prize book which you can't be dumb and be able to read it."" There's something mesmerizing about the way Odell teeters along the line between sense and nonsense, tripping over his own grammar and then barely righting himself. He sounds an awful lot like Will Ferrell imitating George W. Bush, complete with wacky malapropisms (""extenderating circumstances"") and declarations of savviness. But the real object of Krol's scorn isn't this innocent rube; it's the corrupt culture that abuses him.Odell's story begins when he's driving to Callisto, Kan., to enlist in the Army so he can ""be a good  soldier against the mad dog Islamites over there exploding . . .  their own people."" In his wallet he carries a photo of Condoleezza Rice, ""about the smartest woman on the planet and the most decent also, rushing about from one country to the next in her plane fixing things between nations and doing everything she can for world peace and whatnot, all the while looking very trim and smart in her outfits with the pearls and always with a smile."" But before he makes it to Callisto and gets a chance to help Condi fight ""Sammy bin Laden,"" Odell's car breaks down. When he walks up to a run-down country house for help, he falls deeper into the twisted battle against terror than he ever could have imagined.The novel's funniest parts come in this early section, when Odell is invited in by a young ne'er-do-well who claims that his aunt, the owner of the house, is away on vacation. An open grave in the back yard gives Odell pause. ""My mind,"" he tells us, ""was all aswirl with trying to figure out what's happening here."" Finding a body in the basement freezer only adds to his suspicions (though it doesn't quell his hunger for frozen pizza). And soon the novel revs up for a macabre farce, a la the Coen brothers, that involves filling and redigging that grave at least half-a-dozen times. ""This is called adapting to circumstances,"" Odell says, ""which I was very fast learning I had the knack of.""The novel's screwball comedy goes national when Odell's cadaverous antics attract the attention of the FBI, which ""suspicions"" that he's involved with Islamic terrorists set on disrupting the 2008 presidential election. ""I was in deep doo-doo as the saying goes."" A Jerry Falwell-like preacher with Washington connections makes a play for Odell's soul, while whipping up racial anxieties on TV ""in these days of internal threat and menace."" Poor Odell finds himself drawn into competing schemes controlled by people convinced he's the  linchpin to a dangerous conspiracy -- a dark inversion of Jerzy Kosinski's ""Being There."" When an FBI agent says, ""You're smarter than you look,"" Odell assures him, ""No I am not."" But all his denials are taken only as proof of fathomless depth behind his naive demeanor.Unfortunately, like Odell's car, the plot of ""Callisto"" sputters and conks out before it gets where it's going. There's a thick subplot involving corrupt guards at a local prison that doesn't deliver enough jokes or satiric jabs, and once we've chuckled over Odell's verbal tics,  the comedy seeps out of these pages. ""Callisto"" would have been twice as good at half its length, and it doesn't help that Odell admits (on Page 436!) that it's ""much longer than I intended for it to be.""That's particularly disappointing because the novel's finale is a knockout, a wrenching portrayal of America's efforts to snuff out the enemy within. Here, in the secret recesses of our government's most brutal prison, the lack of comedy works just right. Odell slips from the zaniness of ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" to the horrors of ""1984."" When he says, despite everything, ""I felt like joining the Army all over again,"" the full tragedy of what we've endured becomes piercingly clear.Follow Charles at http://twitter.com/roncharles.",0,,,
11,4V0T-XBB0-TX2J-20SH-00000-00.txt,"Americans are scared and eager for change. They elect the Democratic presidential candidate by a healthy margin, in part because they prefer his temperament. But the outcome is, to most, largely a rejection of the brutal status quo. Every day brings more depressing economic news, with banks teetering and foreclosures skyrocketing. During the transition, the outgoing president tries to rope the new man into the crisis--but the president-elect keeps his distance. The country has only one president at a time, he says, telling aides that he doesn't want responsibility without authority.Abraham Lincoln is Barack Obama's favorite president, but it's no wonder he's reading up on Franklin D. Roosevelt. The similarities between 1932-33 and 2008-09 are eerie. And the basic questions during the transition are the same today as they were 76 years ago: How low will the economy sink? Is it better for the incoming president to pitch in with the outgoing administration to forestall disaster--or hang loose? What's the best way to plan for the early weeks after the Inauguration?Of course, the economy was worse then. Unemployment was 25 percent, compared with 6.5 percent today; the stock market was down 90 percent, not the 40-plus percent of 2008. Unlike Obama, FDR defeated an incumbent, Herbert Hoover, and the bitterness between them (to the point that they were shouting at each other on the eve of the Inauguration) was far greater than the enmity between Obama and President Bush.The sequencing of the crisis is also different. In the early 1930s the economy collapsed first, setting off a banking crisis. Today it's a banking crisis that might precipitate an economic collapse. Where Hoover launched a modest intervention in the economy called the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, Bush and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson are investing taxpayer money much more heavily. But in both cases, Republican presidents refused to directly help Americans who were losing their homes. Their Democratic successors took a different view of the American social contract.Like Obama in Chicago, FDR was in a serious mood on the night of his election. ""I'm just afraid I may not have the strength to do the job,"" he told his son, who was helping the paralyzed president-elect into bed. ""Pray for me, Jimmy."" But FDR was so eager to take office that he briefly concocted a scheme whereby Hoover would appoint him secretary of state, then Hoover would resign along with his vice president, Charles Curtis. This would allow Roosevelt to be president immediately instead of waiting four long months until March 4, the date of the Inaugural in those days. (After 1933 it was changed to Jan. 20.) The gambit went nowhere.Both FDR and Obama had mothers who raised them to be confident and secure, vital traits in a president. Just as Obama was smart enough to avoid Bush's offer of a budget and trade deal, FDR wouldn't let himself get pulled into a crisis in late 1932 when European nations refused to pay back their World War I loans. Hoover, who had a higher IQ than FDR but none of his charm, was so disgusted by Roosevelt's cavalier attitude toward the debt crisis that he declined to be photographed with him. ""I have too much respect for myself,"" he told an aide.Hoover wanted FDR to join him in reasserting faith in the old-time conservative philosophy--support for a balanced budget and a stable currency through the gold standard. Had he done so, Hoover confided to a friend, FDR would ""have repudiated two thirds of the so-called New Deal.""To avoid being co-opted, and because he felt like taking a vacation (as usual, without Eleanor), Roosevelt spent 12 critical days during the transition aboard Vincent Astor's yacht, selecting top cabinet members in coded ship-to-shore messages. Roosevelt made decisions more impulsively than Obama. ""I like the cut of his jib!"" he said of Harold Ickes, who was hired five minutes after meeting FDR for the first time. He mixed progressive Republicans like Ickes with conservative Democrats and liberal New Dealers, but stiffed his biggest rival, Al Smith.After barely escaping assassination when he disembarked in Miami, Roosevelt received an urgent letter from Hoover telling him that a banking crisis that began with bad car loans in Detroit was threatening to melt down the financial system of the United States. FDR still refused to be drawn in. To run out the clock, he ignored the letter and later fibbed to Hoover that his secretary had lost it. Today, of course, FDR's cat-and-mouse game would have been on ""Hardball"" by 5 p.m.FDR rightly figured that Hoover had the power to close the banks without his cooperation, but not the guts. If the economy slipped lower still, allowing him to enter stage left as the hero, that was fine with Roosevelt. He'd make the tough decisions when he got to office. Today's Detroit crisis poses a similar challenge to Obama. Should he step in now, or pick through the wreckage of the auto industry after he takes the oath? If he follows the Roosevelt example, he'll choose the latter, more confident course.Roosevelt's first Inaugural in 1933 is remembered for the line ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" This was actually a bit of inspired nonsense; if you're worried about putting food on the table, that's a fear of something more than fear itself. Instead, FDR's more important line was ""action and action now."" He used the word ""act"" or ""action"" six times in the speech.It's not a coincidence that in his interview with ""60 Minutes,"" Obama also stressed the importance of immediate action. And he made reference to experimenting with different policies, an echo of FDR's 1932 speech--ghosted by a reporter--in which he said: ""The country needs and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation. It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly""--a novel concept in the Bush era--""and try another. But above all, try something."" This became the watchword of the New Deal.Obama's government is likely to be less improvisational than Roosevelt's. The head of FDR's Brain Trust, Ray Moley, once quipped that to say the New Deal was the result of a plan was like saying that a boy's bedroom strewn with used chemistry sets and old pennants had been arranged by an interior decorator.In today's instant-gratification culture, Obama will have a much harder time meeting expectations than FDR, who merely had to show some marginal improvement in economic conditions to win big Democratic victories in Congress in 1934 and a landslide re-election in 1936. The Depression didn't end until six years after he took office, with the onset of World War II. While Obama has managed to exceed expectations in the past, he won't have the luxury of a slow recovery.But like Roosevelt, the new president will get public credit if he moves aggressively to restore confidence. The details of the legislation in the first 100 days were less important than the sense of forward movement against the Depression and the sight of the president winning approval of 15 bills in three and a half months. Whatever happens in the first 100 days next year, Obama will need to be seen putting points on the board with splashy bill-signing ceremonies throughout 2009.The way to win on Capitol Hill is to combine an inside game with an outside game. Roosevelt cleverly withheld 60,000 patronage jobs until Congress approved his early legislation. Obama's selection of Rahm Emanuel as chief of staff is partly related to the fact that dozens of members of Congress owe their jobs to Emanuel's successful efforts to win back the House for Democrats in 2006.As for the outside game, FDR knew during the transition that he could use the new medium of his day, radio, to rally the country. Obama already knows that he can be inspirational on TV but that he won't fully succeed in transforming America unless he exploits the new medium of our day, the Internet, to ignite an era of civic action. We've already had the first fireside Web chat. For all Obama's promise, it somehow sounded better on the wireless. ",1,,comparison of two recessions,
12,4VGD-17X0-TX4K-90HB-00000-00.txt,"Here are eight basics that parents of college-bound students should know as a 2009 aid season fraught with economic concerns begins:1. APPLY ASAP: Parents with high school seniors or returning college students should fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid now to have the best chance of receiving aid. This 102-question document is used to determine eligibility for federal aid, state aid and scholarships, and this year there are likely to be more applicants vying for less grant money.Don't wait until your 2008 tax return to file; you can submit an online FAFSA at www.fafsa.ed.gov using estimated tax information to speed the process.2. DON'T RULE OUT PRICEY SCHOOLS: A high sticker price doesn't necessarily mean a higher out-of-pocket cost, especially at schools where significant merit aid might be available.3. DON'T FORGET THE PROFILE: Remember to also fill out the CSS/Financial Aid Profile, used by many private colleges and universities to determine aid eligibility. The form and more information are at the Web site of the College Board, www.collegeboard.com.4. LOOK AT LESS SELECTIVE SCHOOLS: While you're shooting high, make sure you are applying to less selective schools than you might have otherwise to add to your margin of financial safety. Your student might qualify for a merit scholarship or get a good need-based package. Or it may just make more financial sense.5. THE LOSS OF HOME EQUITY VALUE WON'T HELP: Newcomers to the aid process may assume or hope that a big decrease in their home value will put them in line for more financial aid. That's not likely. Household income counts by far the most in the aid equation that also considers non-retirement assets, number of family members in the household, number of kids in college, and taxes.6. LOOK FOR SCHOLARSHIPS ONLINE: Private scholarships offered regionally and locally may help you fill the financing gap even if your student isn't brilliant. Some of the best-known scholarship search sites include Fast Web, Scholarships.com and the College Board's Scholarship Search. Also check with your high school guidance office.7. CALL AID OFFICES: Don't hesitate to call the financial aid offices of schools your student is considering, for information on available aid or for assistance.8. BE WARY OF TAKING ON TOO MUCH DEBT. Federal loan limits have been increased, and parents may be able to find money to finance their child's dream college even in the midst of the worst ***economic crisis** in decades. But think carefully about the consequences of over-borrowing before taking on a huge debt burden just because you can.",0,,,
13,7W4V-SK60-Y9J0-Y1VB-00000-00.txt,"c(""Jul. 12--By the 10th post-college move, I developed a dislike for things that hang on walls and sit on shelves. You call it interior decoration, I call it something that someday will have to be boxed and hauled and unloaded.Bric-a-brac, gimcracks, knickknacks? No thanks.So I felt a little inadequate when Dan Imler paid a visit to my office on Thursday. Imler is the director of acquisitions for Hunt Auctions, a Pennsylvania-based business that specializes in buying and selling sports collectibles.He was headed to St. Louis, where he would set up shop at the Major League Baseball All-Star FanFest at the America's Center and hold an auction at 10 a.m. Tuesday. Among the items he carried with him were an Albert Pujols jersey, a bat used by Ty Cobb and an autographed photo of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.As our conversation wore down, I scanned my desktop for something -- anything -- even loosely related to Major League Baseball to place in his hands to let him know that he and I were not so different. There was only one choice among the handful of items that had arrived in my possession as gifts, giveaways or, in one case, a fouled-off fastball through a press-box window.I locked eyes with the bobblehead likeness of one of my least-favorite Chicago Cubs of all time.The bobblehead nodded back.For those unaffected by irrational minimalism disorder, sports memorabilia is a way to connect with their team and their youth. And, for those who know their stuff, it can be profitable.Imler, 37, grew up in Massachusetts as a Boston Red Sox fan, hoping every pack of baseball cards he tore into contained a Jim Rice or Fred Lynn. His hobby became his career. He can discern between the valuable and the merely sentimental. His job is to bring buyers and sellers together.Imler said the high-end merchandise that is the specialty of his company's auctions has retained value despite the downturn in the economy. A glance through the 268-page book of items available at Tuesday's auction reveals as much. For example, the suggested price of a game-worn Lou Gehrig cap is $75,000 to $125,000, even though, as the description notes, \""the hat shows tremendous usage including interior perspiration toning (forehead in particular).\"" The Cobb bat I casually grasped is worth up to $50,000.As I leafed through the book, one item in particular jumped off the page, cut through my clutter anxiety and perfectly expressed the gallows humor required of a fan of cursed team. It's a pennant that celebrates the 1945 world champion Chicago Cubs.It is valued at $1,000, which is twice as much as the item next to it, a pennant that correctly celebrates the Detroit Tigers as the 1945 world champions.Ah, the misprint. This was my ace in the hole.I picked up the bobblehead and placed it in front of Imler. It's Kyle Farnsworth, he noted, politely but clearly unimpressed.Look closer, I said, and ran my index finger along the base of the doll, where the relief pitcher's name had been embossed by a craftsman as erratic as the athlete himself.\""Kyle Farnswooth,\"" Imler said.Surely this enhanced the value of the collectible.Actually, Imler said, that logic only applied if the company caught the error and corrected it, leaving the misprinted item as a rarity. And although he didn't say this, I'm guessing it helps if the misspelled name doesn't belong to a pitcher with a 31-52 lifetime record.Teased and disappointed again by someone in a Cubs uniform, I asked Imler to be brutally honest. What is the bobblehead worth?\""Maybe 10 bucks,\"" he said.Keep in mind that Farnsworth, with his 98 mph fastball but fragile mind, has a history of inspiring appraisers to overvalue his worth. Just ask his current employer, the Kansas City Royals, who are paying him $4.25 million to rest his strained groin on the disabled list, where he can't blow any more leads.Ten bucks was nine more than I expected.\""That's pretty good for Kyle Farnsworth,\"" I told Imler.\""Farnswooth,\"" he corrected.Reach Joe Walljasper at 573-815-1783 or e-mail jwalljasper@columbiatribune.comThis article was published on page B1 of the Sunday, July 12, 2009 edition of The Columbia Daily Tribune.To see more of the Columbia Daily Tribune, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.columbiatribune.com/.

14,7XD2-VRT1-2R2Y-71VB-00000-00.txt,"c(""Dec. 9--Previously delayed plans for an affordable rental housing tower on state land in Kaka'ako took a significant step forward this week with the publication of an environmental study that encountered no human burial remains on the property, positioning the $86 million project for an expected construction start next summer.Developers of the high-rise called Halekauwila Place have submitted a draft environmental assessment to the Hawai'i Housing Finance and Development Corp., and anticipates the 204-unit project will be complete in early 2012.Halekauwila Place was announced in 2007 and initially projected a 2008 start and 2010 completion.But the global ***financial crisis** killed the market for tax-exempt bonds that had been lined up to finance the tower for development partners Stanford Carr Development and UniDev LLC.The developers managed to attract a $71.2 million investment from electrical worker pension plan National Electrical Benefit Fund, and in January they secured a $15 million loan from the Hawai'i Community Development Authority, the state agency guiding redevelopment efforts in Kaka'ako.In the environmental study published with the state yesterday, the developers reported finding no human remains or other significant cultural artifacts in 18 test trenches dug on the property, each measuring 19.7 feet long and 6.6 feet down to the coral shelf.However, because of past discoveries of pre-contact burials within a block or two of the project site, the developers propose archaeological monitoring during construction and plan to submit a proposal for this to the State Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Land and Natural Resources for approval.The project site is now a parking lot on the makai-diamondhead corner of Keawe and Halekauwila streets. The 1.25-acre site is part of a nearly 7-acre block that also includes Mother Waldron Park, a public library system operations building and a closed road owned by a mix of state agencies and the city.The entire block was the subject of a master plan created in 2000 that envisioned housing, a renovated park and a new elementary school for the property that was the former home of Pohukaina School from about 1912 to 1967.According to the developer's environmental report, improvements to Mother Waldron Park are scheduled for 2010, and there is no timetable for the school.Hawai'i Housing Finance selected Halekauwila Place out of four competing proposals for the residential piece of the plan, granting the Carr-UniDev partnership a 65-year land lease at $1 a year.Halekauwila Place is designed to be a 19-story tower adjacent to a four-story parking garage fronted on two sides with townhouse-style residential units. Several small ground-floor retail spaces are also part of the project.Units in the project range from 414-square-foot studios to three-bedroom units with 1,382 square feet. Most units have one or two bedrooms.The project would be available to residents earning 80 percent to 140 percent of Honolulu's median family income, or $76,100 to $111,020 for a family of four at this year's median income.Under present affordability guidelines, rents could range from $1,331 to $2,886.As part of the financing arrangement, up to 136 of the units would be made available to tenants for purchase as leasehold condominiums under a rent-to-own program. Purchase prices could range from about $350,000 to $500,000 for a family of four, though median incomes and interest rates at the time of an initial five-year purchase option period will determine prices.Reach Andrew Gomes at agomes@honoluluadvertiser.comTo see more of The Honolulu Advertiser or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.honoluluadvertiser.com.

That figure represents more than a third of the UW System's potential $174 million in lost funding.\""The cuts are real, and they are very challenging,\"" UW System President Kevin Reilly said. \""Cuts of this magnitude will certainly impact our plans to grow enrollments and may well hurt the education our current students receive.\""Although UW leaders plan to lobby lawmakers and the governor to restore some of their funding, if the current budget passes system officials say campuses across the state might have to cut their budgets by about 5 percent to make ends meet.Although Martin stressed it's too early to know how, exactly, UW-Madison will be impacted by the state's ***financial crisis**, she did acknowledge asking deans across campus to come up with plans to cut 5 percent from their budgets.\""This may be an overstatement, I hope, of what the conditions will be in the end,\"" Martin said of the 5 percent figure. \""But it could be an understatement.\""If, indeed, UW-Madison's deans must find ways to cut their budgets by 5 percent, Martin said a range of people across campus would be impacted -- some moreso than others.\""I would not want to allocate the cuts across the board, because there are certain things that would need to be protected,\"" said Martin. \""Student services -- such as the Dean of Students' office, academic advising and counseling services -- even if we couldn't protect them 100 percent, those are some of the things that need to be protected as much as possible.\""Most notably, Martin said faculty and staff positions that have been recently vacated due to a retirement or a person taking a job elsewhere likely would go unfilled.\""If the worst-case scenario were to come to be, we would almost certainly have to cut faculty and staff lines, because they are such a huge part of our total budget,\"" Martin said of unfilled positions. \""So there is no way to make significant cuts without affecting faculty and staff lines.\""Not filling those positions would then have a trickle-down effect on students.Martin said UW-Madison's College of Letters &amp; Science has lost 66 \""faculty lines\"" over the past five to 10 years, and losing any more would mean a reduction in majors and courses available to students. In particular, Martin said L&amp;S Dean Gary Sandefur told her that a 5 percent budget reduction would likely make him limit the number of students who major in economics, chemistry, biology and Spanish.On other areas of campus, Martin said a 5 percent reduction in the budget would reduce admissions in some colleges, such as nursing, while the College of Engineering would have to drop one of its majors. Other deans told Martin they would have to eliminate or reduce significantly some of their internship and field-based learning opportunities.Martin also noted there would need to be enrollment caps placed on numerous prerequisite courses, making it harder to get a degree in a timely fashion. She also stressed there would be less money for graduate students in every college.To make UW-Madison's situation especially tough is the fact that endowments it relies on from the UW Foundation and Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation have taken major hits since stock market woes have gone from bad to worse since the fall of 2008. In 2007, those two entities gave $284.5 million to the university -- and that figure is sure to drop in the coming years.Add it up, and some of these changes could be \""transformative, in a negative sense,\"" said Martin, who nonetheless remains upbeat.\""I'm an eternal optimist and it's important to emphasize we just don't yet know how this is going to impact us,\"" she said. \""I think everybody at the university understands that the pain that everybody is feeling has to be shared. What we're hoping is it's not the worst-case scenario in terms of the pain that we'll have to absorb, because we think it doubles back and then affects people in the state negatively.\""The regents on Thursday approved guidelines for system campuses to follow as they develop budget-cutting plans. Those guidelines include merging or eliminating unpopular or academic programs, reducing travel and the slowing of the Growth Agenda -- a program designed to increase the number of Wisconsin residents with a bachelor's degree so workers in the state are better positioned to succeed in a future, knowledge-based economy. Doyle's current budget proposal does not contain any of the $29 million the system was looking for to move the Growth Agenda forward.Details of the budget, including tuition increases, won't be finalized until a July Board of Regents meeting.In other news from Thursday's Board of Regents meeting on the UW-Madison campus: -- Despite these potentially significant cuts, regents David Walsh and Elizabeth Burmaster both stressed the need for UW leaders to remember that people throughout the state are being hit hard by the ***recession**, and that everyone in the state is going to have to share some of the economic pain before Wisconsin can move forward.\""Let's not lose track of what's happened in the real world,\"" said Walsh, a partner in the Madison office of Foley &amp; Lardner, a national law firm. \""... Back in 2002 it was a $2.2 billion state deficit. Today it's a $5.7 billion state deficit. And I am told ... that we are kidding ourselves about the $5.7 billion. If anybody in this room thinks that sales tax and individual income has increased in the last six months, they've been asleep. And all I am saying is that we are in a bad, bad time. And so the issue for me isn't, 'Do we have some pain?' But the issue for me is, 'If we are going to have pain, is it fair?' \"" ... Of course, it's going to hurt everybody. We're all going to have to tighten our belts. But I promise you when you look around this country, it's bad.\""After Walsh's lengthy and heart-felt remarks, Burmaster, Wisconsin's superintendent of public instruction, added that \""in the K-12 system, we see every day, face to face, the impact of our economic situation. Just look at the rising homelessness, homeless schoolchildren. That's pervasive throughout our state. I think we have to rise to that level of understanding of what's going on. There's going to be pain everywhere.\""-- UW officials were quick to praise Gov. Doyle's decision to provide in his budget $12 million to the UW System and $24 million to the Higher Education Aids Board for need-based student aid. That initiative should be enough to offset upcoming tuition increases for resident undergraduate students who come from families who earn up to the state's median annual income of $60,000.-- Of the $174 million in cuts system-wide, different pots of money are targeted. Just more than $120 million comes directly from taxpayer support, while $28.6 million comes from program revenues and $25 million from fees derived from payments for residence halls, parking lots and other auxiliary services.If system leaders wanted to raise tuition to cover the loss of the $120.4 million that comes directly from taxpayers, they would have to jack it up by 17 percent, said Reilly.\""But that's not going to happen,\"" he quickly interjected. \""I repeat, that's not going to happen. ... It's vital that we preserve access to the UW.\""-- Included in that $174 million total that may be cut from the UW System is a 1 percent, across-the-board cut of the system's program revenue, or about $28.6 million, \""to create additional efficiencies and balance the budget.\""According to the Associated Press, system leaders believe that provision makes it seem as though campuses would have to transfer $10.7 million in income from gifts, donations and trust funds to the state's general fund -- a situation UW System leaders say is not fair.\""We need every single dollar that our alums and supporters have provided to help students with access and affordability, and to ensure the quality of this great research university,\"" Martin told The Capital Times. \""For that reason, taking or freezing private gift money would have a chilling effect on our future ability to raise supplemental funds in the private sector and would also break faith with those alums and supporters who have given to us so generously over time.\""-- Although any federal stimulus funding the UW System receives isn't expected to be massive, Reilly acknowledged that without such additional money funneling to Wisconsin, the system's budget woes would have been even worse.-- UW System leaders took two hours to look back at the now-completed Plan 2008, the system's most recent 10-year diversity initiative.Reilly noted that if the UW System is going to help a much larger percentage of state residents earn undergraduate degrees in years to come that Wisconsin's public colleges will have to be \""much more successful with educating and graduating many more students from all backgrounds.\""-- The board approved UW-Madison's request for authority to increase the $12.4 million budget of the Chadbourne and Barnard Residence Halls Renovation project by $1.4 million.Todd Finkelmeyer - 3/06/2009 6:45 am""

16,7VXF-T960-Y9S8-W008-00000-00.txt,"After shepherding an economic stimulus and landmark credit card regulations through Congress, there is little denying the Obama administration's prowess at pushing an economic agenda.But there have been few issues where the administration has been so far out in front of Congress publicly than the looming overhaul of the regulatory structure of the financial system.Since March, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has outlined several proposals that will form the backbone of a comprehensive plan to firm up oversight of the industry and financial markets that the administration intends to roll out June 17.Several other administration proposals -- generally acknowledged to be trial balloons -- have floated over Capitol Hill and K Street in recent weeks, circulating among congressional staffs and industry groups.In contrast to the way it has dealt with other major policy initiatives like health care and energy, where it has left most of the details to Congress, the administration plans to send draft legislation to the Hill dealing with several of its financial proposals, including the creation of an authority to wind down major non-bank institutions on the verge of failure and rules that would allow shareholders more of a say on executive compensation.Many lawmakers like the hands-on approach, acknowledging that the guiding hand of a popular administration is helpful, especially on an issue that could become so politically divisive.But that doesn't mean Democratic lawmakers are simply going to fall in line. Some, such as Rep. Brad Sherman,  D-Calif., have been skeptical of the proposals. A vocal critic of just about everything Geithner has proposed to address the ***financial crisis**, Sherman came out firing again June 10, when the administration outlined its executive compensation proposal. He complained that it fell far short in its efforts to rein in lavish pay and bonuses that critics believe encourage risky business behavior.At the same time, Sherman acknowledged the White House's tactical advantage.""Over the last 50 years, power has moved to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, in large part because this place is divided,"" Sherman said. ""And this is an administration that doesn't fight [with] itself, headed by a president that is a lot more charismatic than the last guy.""Congress Holds Back on SpecificsAides in both chambers say staff members are hard at work on regulatory overhaul proposals. But the administration has been given every opportunity to lead the way. Until last week, the primary players on the issue in Congress had held off releasing any specifics of their eventual legislation, though some individual lawmakers have drafted bills that could become part of a broader overhaul.Christopher J. Dodd, the chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, became the first when, on June 11, he announced his intention to include an independent financial safety commission in his overhaul plan.But Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who also has been tapped to help lead the push to overhaul the health care system, has been largely quiet otherwise, content to continue closed-door meetings with staff while awaiting the administration proposal. His House counterpart, Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank, D-Mass., has indicated the basic direction he sees his bill going, and reacted -- sometimes strongly -- to administration proposals. But Frank has not put out any detailed position papers or specific language.Both chairmen have held hearings on issues relevant to the overhaul, and Geithner is scheduled to appear before both panels the day after he releases the administration plan.For Frank, the current arrangement makes sense. ""Look, when you have an administration that you're supportive of, and they also have 20 times as many people to draft things and do things, they will play a major role,"" he said in an interview.Democrats on Frank's committee agree, even those aware that the administration's proposal may not go as far as they would like to rein in certain Wall Street practices and products.""They've got a megaphone that is bigger than what's available to every member of Congress put together, and I think we recognize that,"" said Rep. Brad Miller,  D-N.C. ""And there are several of us who are working with the administration on several provisions.""  'Not Just Waiting' But while the administration may be driving the conversation now, Frank said, ""Just because they send [legislative language] doesn't mean you accept it exactly."" That sentiment is echoed by many Democratic lawmakers in the House, who will likely find themselves voting on a final piece of legislation in that chamber by the end of July. Some say a lot is happening on Capitol Hill behind the scenes.""We're not just waiting for them to present us with their plan,"" Miller said. And lawmakers, particularly Frank, have not been shy about expressing their views of various administration ideas. That, in itself, could help shape the eventual plan. For instance, when the White House floated the possibility of creating a single bank regulator, the idea was widely panned by lawmakers and key interest groups. The administration appears to have stepped back from the idea.Regardless, as far as Frank is concerned, the true driver of the conversation may not be lawmakers or the administration at all. The ***economic downturn** that has hammered the country for much of the past year has exposed questionable industry practices and laid bare the shortcomings of existing federal regulations.That, Frank believes, will make reaching a consensus much easier, no matter who is leading the charge. ""Reality has driven it,"" he said. ""It's a common thing. As we thought about and they thought about and we started talking, it turned out we had a lot in common.""

Donating to political campaigns isn't one of them.That's evident in Chelmsford where several candidates running for selectman are loaning themselves money just to do some basic campaigning.Candidate Steven Roberts spent more than $1,000 out of his own pocket to help pay for bulk mailings and yard signs.\""Mailing is a big and expensive part of campaigning, but it helps reach those people who you might not get to meet knocking on doors,\"" Roberts said. \""It's about making people aware of who you are when they head to the polls.\""Candidate George Dixon, who was weighing whether he'll need to put $800 of his own cash into another mailing yesterday, said he doesn't feel comfortable asking his friends and neighbors for money.\""No one has any money right now,\"" Dixon said. \""It's humbling enough that people are willing to donate their own time to help you get elected.\""All six candidates vying for two open seats on the board agreed that in a crippled economy, volunteers can outweigh the value of a dollar.Even simple campaigning isn't cheap, said Ken Hanson, a member of the Committee to Elect Matthew Hanson. Just one mailing to 15 percent of the town's registered voters -- about 3,501, out of 23,246 total -- can add up to more than $2,000 with the cost of postcards and stamps.Hanson, as well as candidate Sean Scanlon have each spent more than they raised as of March30, according to campaign finance reports due in the town clerk's office yesterday by 4 p.m.\""Our volunteers really saved us,\"" said Nancy Scanlon, Sean Scanlon's wife and campaign volunteer. \""The hours they've put in are priceless when you think about all the work involved.\""From standing outside and holding signs to knocking on doors, Nancy Scanlon, who is pregnant with the couple's second child, said getting out a message that's effective yet cost-efficient is the way to go.Don Van Dyne spent Saturday holding campaign signs in Chelmsford Center with his daughter, Maggie-Molloy, 7.\""Money is tough for most people,\"" Van Dyne said. \""I've been getting by with a strong base of support from family, friends and neighbors just contributing time to get the message out there.

Late filing can result in fines of $10 a day for the oversight, according to state campaign laws.Town Clerk Betty Delaney said she allows for a little wiggle room before referring late candidates to the state Office of Campaign and Political Finance, which issues the fines.Murray said he's raised less than $300, and estimates that he's probably invested the same. Murray said he's putting most of his money into a mass mailing, with a small donation going toward a group of bagpipers called The Bunker Hill Pipe Band.The band, which has opened up for the DropKick Murphys, drew a crowd in Chelmsford Center last weekend. Murray will bring them back this Saturday from 9 a.m. to noon.\""I don't think you have to throw a bunch of money at a campaign to make it work,\"" he said. \""It's about leg work, and I've got a lot of good people behind me.\""Campaign finance reports are public record and available for viewing at the town clerk's office, 50 Billerica Road.To see more of The Sun, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.lowellsun.com.

18,4TP7-WR90-TWX3-K0JH-00000-00.txt,"The federal government's infusion of $250 billion for major banks, with very few strings attached, should help restore confidence in the financial industry. But it's become increasingly clear that the broader economy faces more pain, more job losses, and a longer recovery. That means policymakers in Washington must focus more attention on struggling families and job creation. The nine large banks receiving Treasury's initial outlay will now be better able to lend and borrow. But the fact that the government has given them nearly a blank check compels these institutions to follow through on the expectation, as Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. put it, to ""deploy"" capital. Community banks don't like the plan announced Tuesday by President Bush, saying their larger competitors are being rewarded for irresponsible lending. Small banks, meanwhile, don't need as much help because many of them didn't buy into risky subprime mortgages. As drastic as this step was, Treasury probably didn't have much choice. The panic in the credit market was preventing even the most profitable of companies from obtaining short-term loans to finance their operations, such as making payroll. European governments led the way by making similar investments in their banks to ease the global credit crisis. Their concerted action apparently convinced the Bush administration to make a move that Paulson had earlier resisted. Treasury will buy $250 billion of preferred stock in banks, using part of the $700 billion bailout approved by Congress and the president two weeks ago. The government's preferred stock will pay a 5-percent dividend for the first five years. As part of the deal, banks will be restricted in what they can pay their executives as long as the government is an investor. The idea is to discourage CEOs from making risky investments. That feature was needed to allay public anger as well. This plan is intended to spur lending, not to reward bank shareholders with lucrative dividends. But more assurances that taxpayer dollars will not end up in the pockets of shareholders are needed. Paulson hasn't addressed that concern. He also insists this rescue is temporary. But weaning the financial industry off this free milk could be difficult in the years ahead. Nor has this plan soothed the stock market. The Dow fell more than 800 points in the last two days, largely erasing the gains from Monday's huge rally. It's a sign that investors are still worried about the health of the wider economy. There's good reason for that investor skepticism. Nearly nine out of 10 people think the country is on the wrong track, and consumer confidence has plummeted. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the economy. Congress is talking about passing another stimulus package, this one aimed at Main Street. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) is advocating as much as $300 billion for infrastructure, job creation, food stamps, unemployment insurance, and health care for children and seniors. These are costly steps, but they may well be needed to help people through an ***economic downturn** that looks to be prolonged and severe.  ",1,,,

Well, that doesn't mean people don't get sick.\""A lot of hospitals want to call you and interview you as a nursing student,\"" Marquez said. \""The demand is that (high) for nursing. It's not that difficult to get a job.\""Most people, however, aren't as lucky. Unemployment levels continue to climb across the Rio Grande Valley and last month Hidalgo County registered the highest unemployment rate of any county in the state -- 8.2 percent.But the Valley's healthcare market continues to prosper, local college graduates specializing in business and engineering are finding jobs easier than most, and statewide unemployment is still below the national average.STANDING OUTDespite the worst ***recession** in decades, it's still possible to find work. From choosing the right field, to continuing education, now is the time to re-evaluate and relearn the basics of job hunting.\""In order to set yourself apart you've got to take initiative,\"" said Susie Chapa, assistant director for the office of career services at the University of Texas-Pan American. \""Do an internship. Do some volunteer work. That's what's going to set them apart from others who apply for the same job.\""Alexis Diaz regrets not entering the workforce before returning to UT-Brownsville to earn a master's degree in business. Now, the 25-year-old is entering the workforce without experience and with little to set him apart from the swelling ranks of the unemployed.

Still, there are some things they can do to improve their chances of finding work.Consider continuing education to learn a marketable, specialized skill, experts said. Whether it's a professional development class or a two-year degree, padding the resume is important.\""It's a mistake to assume that the only thing to do is go to a four-year institution. It's not an automatic ticket to success in the U.S.,\"" said Tom Pauken, chairman of the Texas Workforce Commission. \""This is a time for people to be fiscally prudent. Why not go to a community college?\""Enrollment in higher-education institutions tends to increase in bad economic times, but Pauken cautioned that taking on enormous debt to attend a university is probably a bad move for many people.Mechanics, electricians and other skilled labor work will always be in some level of demand, he said.\""We're really feeling the effects of this economic ***recession**,\"" Pauken warned. \""Young people think, 'Gosh, I've got to worry about what I'm going to do in a few years.' This is a time for real soul searching.\""That search might also mean finding a new profession.DIFFERING JOB DEMANDLocally, job growth has continued the strongest in the healthcare sector, according to the workforce commission.\""There's a lack of nurses not only here but in the U.S. as a whole,\"" said Teresa Rodriguez, vice president of community development for the McAllen Chamber of Commerce. \""We're all getting old, and we get sick, and we need the medical attention.\""Demand for bilingual nurses, too, is swelling across the country as the population of native-Spanish speakers continues to grow. That means many in the largely bilingual Valley are far more marketable than their peers elsewhere across the country, experts agreed.Aside from the healthcare industry, skills related to maquiladora management will also remain in demand for the foreseeable future, from the management level to the engineers that design products and operate the robotics, said Chapa, the UTPA career services official.The local maquiladora and manufacturing industry has shed relatively few jobs this year, with companies continuing to move to the Valley during the ***recession** -- albeit at a slower pace than before.They, too, will need laborers, especially skilled workers. Many of them have training programs and provide decent benefits.On the whole, students with degrees from business and engineering schools are finding it easier to find work than others, Chapa said.Marquez, the nursing student, is already planning to enroll in a master's program after graduating in spring 2009. He intends to take classes around his work schedule.It's that initiative and rigorous work ethic that matters so much more in a bad economy. It's that discipline that will likely give Marquez an edge, even though he's in a field where you don't really need it.\""I think there's never enough,\"" Marquez said. \""I guess nursing feels like you've never ever studied enough.\""Sean Gaffney covers business, the economy and general assignments for The Monitor.

Jobs in that sector include manufacturing, health care and technology. Most are prized for their high wages as well as their ability to create additional jobs in the economy.According to the Idaho Department of Labor, the state's seasonally adjusted labor force totaled 753,200 in April, including 23,100 unemployed people, for a 3.1 percent unemployment rate, the department said in a statement. Unemployment stood at 3 percent a month earlier and 2.7 percent in April 2007. The service sector added about 8,700 jobs. The non-farm jobs total increased by about 1,400, or a quarter percentage point, from April 2007.That was the smallest April year-to-year gain in Idaho since the national economic lull in 2002, Fick said.""There is no question that the economy is soft and is going to be soft for a while"" in Idaho, he said. ""There is some belief that the economy is more diverse than it ever has been and that it is going to be able to skate through if there is a national ***recession**.

Manufacturing accounted for 13,596,000 jobs (preliminary) compared to 13,642,000 in March.Manufacturing hours fell from 41.2 to 40.9 hours nationwide during April, with reductions spread across durable and nondurable industries, Hall said. Factory overtime fell by one-tenth of an hour per week, Hall said.Wages are not yet falling, despite cost-cutting measures including staff reductions in some sectors.Citing the most recent Idaho Occupational Employment and Wage Survey based on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Fick said the average hourly wage for all Idaho occupations was $16.73 as of early 2007 compared to $16.12 in early 2006. The median was $13.47 compared to $13.04 in 2006.For all production occupations, Idaho's average hourly wage was $13.57 in early 2007 and $13.04 a year earlier, he said. The median was $12.58 compared to $12.03 a year earlier.Inflation is one factor in year-to-year changes in wages, Fick said.Pete Crabb, finance and economics professor at Northwest Nazarene University in Nampa, said he expects stagnant wages, on fewer hires, through this year.Wages can be ""sticky"" after job cuts, as remaining employees earn the same wage or even overtime pay, he said.""I don't see wages and salaries as poor,"" Crabb said.

22,4VHB-J480-TX12-N0W1-00000-00.txt,"c(""Feb. 1--California's horrendous budget crisis has its roots in a 1978 decision by then-Gov. Jerry Brown and the Legislature to temporarily shoulder billions of dollars in school and local government costs in response to voters' passage of Proposition 13, which deeply slashed local property taxes.The prevailing Capitol assumption at the time was that either the courts would overturn Proposition 13 or voters would repeal it. But neither happened. The bailout, especially the state's assumption of basic responsibility for schools, became permanently ingrained in the budget and eventually, at the behest of voters, in the state constitution.Then as now, the problem is that the state revenue system, primarily sales and personal income taxes, cannot consistently generate enough income to cover all of the state's commitments, especially since Proposition 13's passage was followed by state tax cuts, including one that Brown and lawmakers enacted immediately to prove they had gotten voters' anti-tax message.A big aspect of our never-ending debate over taxes and spending has been whether we need a spending growth limit to curb the tendency to enact new spending and tax cuts when the state is enjoying a temporary economic (and revenue) boom.Brown declared himself a \""born-again tax cutter\"" and semi-supported a tight spending limit sponsored by Proposition 13 co-author Paul Gann, enacted in 1979. Then voters modified the Gann limit in 1990 to the point of irrelevancy. Now, nearly 20 years later, a spending cap is back on the political agenda as a potential trade-off for Republican votes for new taxes to close the state's immense budget deficit.GOP lawmakers want a limit such as the combination of inflation and population growth (about 5 percent a year), growth in per capita personal income, which would probably be looser in most years, or the lower of the two indices.A tight cap could eliminate big budget deficits, especially if revenues over the limit went into a \""rainy day\"" reserve. The left-leaning California Budget Project has calculated that were such a limit in place for the past 14 years, state general fund spending would be $32 billion below the current level of about $103 billion a year.But, the CBP's Jean Ross says, \""such a cap would result in permanent draconian cuts to California services.\"" And Democrats and their allies, especially public worker unions, loathe it. Among other things, it might supercede Proposition 98, the 1988 ballot measure that guarantees levels of state support for schools.State general fund spending growth over the last decade, adjusted for population and inflation, has been close to zero, yet the state has amassed a huge deficit.Clearly, the fiscal system is out of whack, and a carefully written spending cap with realistic emergency provisions could be part of a repair, perhaps as a swap for eliminating the two-thirds vote on budgets. In fact, a new statewide poll indicates voters would like such a deal.Call The Bee's Dan Walters, (916) 321-1195.

Consumer Credit Counseling of Greater Dallas has issued a few tips for those hoping to save on back-to-school shopping.Take inventory of what you currently have at home and create a list of only items your children need. Stick to essentials. As the year goes on, you can always purchase items as needed.Check resale shops and your friends' closets. Resale shops started popping up a few months after the ***recession** began during 2007 and have continued to grow in popularity as consumers focus on bargains. Also, swapping clothes with friends who have younger or older children can result in a fresh wardrobe at a fraction of the price.Don't open department store credit card accounts. Retailers will promote extra savings with the opening of a store credit card, but these cards usually come with a high interest rate, which negates the one-time 10 percent to 20 percent savings by adding interest during the life of the debt.Research and shop online. You'll be less likely to buy things you don't need when shopping online, but watch out for expensive shipping charges and protect yourself by making sure the online transactions are secure.Books on your P.C., phoneBook retailer Barnes and Noble has taken the next logical step in the electronic book market by offering titles in multiple platforms.While top booksellers Amazon and Sony have long offered book titles in electronic form for specific reading instruments like the Kindle and the Sony Reader, the question in consumers' minds has been, ""Why do I have to buy an electronic reader when I've got a perfectly good computer right here?""Well, beginning this week, Barnes and Noble will not only offer electronic books that are readable on desktop computers, but also on popular hand held devices like the iPhone, iPod touch and BlackBerry smartphone.Through its eBookstore (www.bn.com/ebooks), the company is offering customers seamless access to more than 700,000 titles, including hundreds of new releases and bestsellers, for $9.99.

That's 2.3 percent more than the average $694 per week that a resident of the county earned on the job during the first quarter of 2008.Of course, it bears noting that about 2,900 fewer people were employed in St. Louis County during the first three months of 2009 -- a decline of more than 3 percent compared with the same period last year.Drew Digby, a regional labor analyst for the state, also observed that many of the reductions in certain industries, such as mining, took greatest hold after the first quarter, the latest period for which data is available.Some sectors have seen more pressure on wages than others. For instance, manufacturing wages slipped 3.6 percent from a weekly average of $871 during the first quarter of last year to $840 this year.Digby theorized that average weekly earnings for some workers also may be trending upward because of overtime logged in workplaces that are now shortstaffed.\""Since the ***recession** really hit, some employers, instead of recalling workers as business picks back up, are simply adding hours to their existing work force.

In the second, he founded the most famous hedge fund blow-up of all time, Long Term Capital Management, whose demise in 1998 shook the financial system.Now he is in the news again as his latest firm, JWM Partners, joins the growing list of hedge funds closing down. The firm's main fund has lost 44 percent in the past two years, having returned an average of 1.46 percent a year since 1999.Meriwether is the yeti of New York finance: much discussed but little known. He grew up in Chicago, and joined Salomon in the mid-1970s. He was reported to have a preternatural gift for pricing bonds, and led Salomon into the then nascent business of bond arbitrage. In the 1980s, this became a bonanza for the bank, though it led to a trading scandal that all but sank the firm.Meriwether then set up Long Term Capital Management, skimming the cream of bond traders, a couple of Nobel laureates in economics and $1.3 billion in capital to start operating in 1994. It was the iconic hedge fund of its time, returning over 40 percent to investors in its best years.In 1998, however, its highly leveraged trades came undone with the Russian ***financial crisis**. It lost $4.6 billion in a matter of months and the Federal Reserve organised a bailout.Meriwether is now 61, a near scratch golfer, and surely doesn't need the money.

Gregory Mankiw suggests that negative interest rates could kick-start the economy. A way to achieve this, he argues, is for the Federal Reserve to produce enough inflation to motivate people to borrow and spend.   But can't our current problems be traced to unsustainable levels of borrowing and spending? Keeping that merry-go-round spinning will only prolong and deepen the crisis.   Remember that someone has to save in order for someone else to borrow, and that savings squandered on consumption are not available for investment. Economies grow precisely because consumers do not spend but loan their savings to businesses to fund capital investment instead.  The column argued that more inflation may be preferable to current economic problems. But with its ability to wipe out savings and stifle investment, inflation is the ultimate weapon of financial destruction. At best such a plan trades short-term gain for long-term pain. Ask anyone in Argentina if it's a deal worth making.  Peter SchiffWilton, Conn., April 19  The writer, president of Euro Pacific Capital, was an adviser to the 2008 presidential campaign of Ron Paul.  To the Editor:  The idea of negative interest rates and a government bolstering of inflation might not be a problem for millionaires and those still in their earning years. But what about the millions of senior citizens who, struggling to get by on fixed incomes, have already been penalized by the way their interest income has dwindled away to practically nothing over the past seven months?  When interest rates don't keep up with the cost of living, seniors are in a sense already paying the government to keep their money, and fueling whatever recovery the economy has seen.

The bank continued its transformation to become an aggressive, but efficient, competitor on the global landscape"", ""It has been quite a year for the ICBC group.  Not only did the bank transform itself, with enhanced cost control and income structure optimization, but also it worked to create huge gains in after-tax profits.  In addition, the bank faced one of its biggest challenges with grace and skill -- dealing with the effects of the magnitude 8.0 earthquake that hit Sichuan Province in May.Facing such a devastating earthquake, ICBC responded quickly to the disaster.  Branches in quake areas moved fast to minimize casualties and losses.  There were no lives lost in the bank's office and operating outlets, thanks to the cool-headed responses of ICBC staff, and there were no losses of cash or information at bank branches.Assuming the economic and social responsibilities of a large bank at a critical moment in the history of the country, ICBC was the first bank to resume operations in disaster areas.  ICBC organized mobile banks to provide emergency services on account management, payment settlement and credit card business; enabled online collection of donations for quake areas; and granted loans of RMB9.76 billion ($ 1.43 billion) for disaster relief and reconstruction.As of 30 June, the Bank donated a total of RMB120 million to disaster areas -- including RMB88.69 million in worldwide employee donations and RMB33.22 million from business units. Business TransformationIn response to the changes in the external operating environment, ICBC underwent a business transformation in the first half of this year -- enhancing cost control with continuous optimization of income structure -- and achieved more than 50% growth in after-tax profit.  Profit after tax reached RMB64.9 billion, a RMB23.5 billion increase over the same period last year.  Operating income rose RMB37 billion, or 31.8%, net interest income increased by 28.9% and the non-interest income surged by 50.7%.  Application of a new income tax rate also contributed to the remarkable increase in after-tax profits.The economic and financial environment at home and abroad clearly experienced fundamental changes in the first half of 2008.  ICBC focused on five key areas in order to best manage these changes while also undergoing its fundamental shift in focus.First, the bank focused on continued high growth of operating efficiency.  Second, continued enhancement of market competitiveness was a key priority.  As competition grew, ICBC focused on maintaining its top industry position in intermediary business by leveraging its strengths in settlement, agency and other conventional business lines.  In response to capital market changes, the bank sped up its development of the wealth management business and further focused on investment banking services.  ICBC ranked first in the underwriting of commercial papers and mid-term notes, and developed its asset securitisation, financial leasing and full-license annuity businesses, as well.Third, ICBC strove for continued stable and sound development of its credit business by controlling rational credit growth, focusing on credit restructuring, and raising return on credit business with a high-quality credit portfolio developed through diverse channels and big volume business.  Fourth, the bank continued to further refine its comprehensive risk management framework and reporting mechanisms by developing risk management assessment measures and risk limit management rules.Finally, ICBC had a clear focus on customer service development.  The bank highlighted the concepts of \""customer-oriented\"" and \""services-create-value\"" and continuously improved the customer experience.  In addition to re-engineering the personal banking process last year, corporate banking processes were optimized, business processing was centralized inter-regionally and remote authorization and supervision center pilot reform were begun, thereby continuously enhancing customer service efficiency and intensifying management capability. Strong Financial PerformanceIn the first half of 2008, ICBC took advantage of market opportunities to improve return on assets.  The bank proactively adjusted and optimized asset structures, improving interest rate management and enhancing bargaining power in loan transactions.  On the asset and liability side ICBC expanded its low-cost liability operations by promoting deposits and adjusting the deposit mix, which efficiently mitigated the negative impact from the cumulative effect of the tightened monetary policy.  The net result was a higher rise in return on assets than in liability costs.  Net interest spread and net interest margin stood at 2.88% and 3.01% -- an increase of 34 and 36 basis points, respectively, over the first half of last year.The average loan yield to customers grew from 5.81% in the first half of 2007 to 6.97% in the first half of 2008 as a result of loan re-pricing, improved interest rate management and enhanced loan quality and loan mix.  In addition, an upturn in the yield curve of the renminbi bond market and further optimization of the investment portfolio increased the average yield on investment in securities from 2.91% in the first half of 2007 to 3.30% in the first half year of 2008, resulting in increased average yield of interest-generating assets to 4.91%, a boost of 66 basis points. Looking AheadIn the second half of 2008, China's economy is expected to maintain sustainable growth, although the impact of the US sub-prime ***mortgage crisis** may be aggravated and the increasing global inflation pressure and slowdown of global economy will pose challenges for China's economic growth.Domestic macro-control is expected to slow down the growth of credit scale of commercial banks.  RMB appreciation, reduction of international market demands and rise of production costs will reduce the profitability of certain enterprises, thereby bringing about pressure on the loan quality of commercial banks.  At the same time, the capital markets downturn will slow down the development of intermediary businesses of commercial banks which are closely related to the capital markets.ICBC will rise to these challenges by striving to improve business and market innovation, brand image, customer service, risk control and supporting capability; and consolidating and strengthening its core business lines in the market.  In line with China's macro-control and industry policy orientation, the bank will actively adjust credit asset structure, keep optimizing the industry, region and customer structure of credit extension, actively compete for quality credit and maintain steady and moderate growth of credit business.In addition, ICBC will continue to push forward financial innovation by optimizing asset and liability business structure, actively expanding the sources of low-cost funds, developing noncredit business and increasing the proportion of fee and commission income.ICBC will also endeavor to improve financial services, speed up the update and integration of service channels, and actively re-engineer business processes.  It will further optimize the organizational structure, integrate marketing resources, and establish a customer-centered service marketing system.  Risk management is also a key concern of the bank, and it will further improve comprehensive risk management systems, conduct dynamic monitoring, early warning and stress testing of risks, and control various risk limits.Finally, by accelerating international and diversified operations, expanding overseas service networks and enhancing the market development capability of overseas operations, ICBC will seek out a new trail of comprehensive development and diversify asset allocation and income sources.Contact UsFor more information visit our web sites at www.icbc.com.cnwww.icbc-ltd.com""

It was the biggest jump in more than two years.In a note to investors, Kent said IGT shares were trading within the value of just one aspect of the Reno-based company's operations. He reiterated his \""buy\"" recommendation on the company.\""IGT has been under pressure recently along with much of the gaming sector,\"" Kent said. \""Fear of fewer casino openings, (capital expenditure) cutbacks for machines and a delay in central server technology may be weighing on shares.\""Kent said IGT expects to announce a restructuring plan before the end of the year that could return profit margins closer to the 30 percent range the company reported in 2007. He said the restructuring will include expense controls. He added that the company's recently announced plans for layoffs within IGT's 5,400-person work force was a good thing for the bottom line.\""IGT may need to be slimmed down for a more competitive and slower growth environment,\"" Kent said.Also, he expects IGT to get a boost when it showcases its newest products at the Global Gaming Expo in November. Meanwhile, new gaming markets could open as states deal with budget shortfalls and look for ways to increase tax revenues.\""After the past two ***recession**s, several new states rolled out gaming,\"" Kent said. \""New markets opening may offset delays in casino expansions or replacements.\""Earlier in the week, IGT's shares slumped to a six-year low on comments by Roth Capital gaming analyst Todd Eilers. He said his legal sources suggested the company may face an unfavorable ruling on certain patents in its pending lawsuit with Bally Technologies. However, nothing was ever unveiled.

It aims to keep the historic look of some parts of downtown and encourage pedestrian-friendly construction.But some critics argue that the guidelines are too restrictive.And City Council members balked when they heard that developer Roy Carroll, who built Center Pointe on Elm Street, had concerns about the design guide.Some property owners were worried that the manual would constrict their ability to redevelop properties and would discourage new investment.\""In good times, the city should be helping to stimulate growth in the downtown area, much less an economic ***recession**,\"" Isaacson said. \""Whatever they are doing, the timing is terrible.\""Isaacson pointed out that some downtown landmarks, such as the First Citizen or United Guaranty buildings, would not meet the guidelines.City staff members said the guidelines aren't as restrictive as some property owners think.But Hails said they were willing to discuss concerns to make sure everyone is comfortable with the manual.Contact Amanda Lehmert at 373-7075 or amanda.lehmert@news-record.comTo see more of the News &amp; Record or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.news-record.com.

Credit Cardsby Phillip Neel, of Arlington, who writes:If you truly want to spring clean your life, it's time to ditch your credit cards. We all know that plastic pseudo-currency tempts us to buy almost anything today and repay next month, next year or even next decade. And we know that a card's interest and fees can dwarf the original price of whatever toy, bauble, event or shroud that we or -- heaven help us -- our kids purchase.The worst aspect of credit cards, though, is psychological. When you can immediately have almost any consumer good you want, you wind up not appreciating much of anything. You frequently tell yourself, with a prod from advertisers, that ""I'm worth it."" You pay for something with plastic, and then, before the bill arrives, it's off to the next shiny distraction, payable of course with Visa or MasterCard. You end up with more stuff, more debt, and less satisfaction with any one item.Contrast today's attitude with the ancient 1950s through 1970s, when kids and adults actually had to save money before buying something. If you were a kid, you'd do yard work, save your earnings and then buy that bike of your dreams. Sure, it took time, but you had an emblem of your labors and a reason to actually take care of the thing. And because you had less stuff in the first place, you used the bike. Now, kids and adults pull out plastic for nearly everything but the mortgage. Merchants love this, because studies show that people spend more if they ""pay"" with a credit card instead of the cold-water-in-the-face reality of actual cash. Yet it is this reality that we sorely need, to put not just our finances in order but also our attitudes toward consumption. After all, you're worth it.",0,,,
35,7V0W-9V90-Y9J0-Y1V2-00000-00.txt,"c(""Feb. 13--Even in hard economic times, it might seem the state's farmers could take refuge in the simple fact that laid-off workers and nervous 401(K) watchers still need to eat.But the global ***economic downturn** has reached farmers of all stripes in a state where farm-related businesses generate $70 billion a year, more than any other economic sector.Nurseries have found few new homes ripe for planted flowers and sod. Poultry barns sit empty as struggling national companies cancel contracts. Those who raise livestock -- which makes up nearly two-thirds of farm receipts statewide -- face prices lowered by reduced demand.For many North Carolina farmers, consumer belt-tightening is aggravating troubles that began before the ***recession**, when drought ravaged crops and the gas price spike pushed up the cost of petroleum-based fertilizers, animal feed and the diesel fuel that runs tractors and other equipment.Ricky Britt, who raises chickens and cows near Ahoskie, says his income last year was down $100,000. \""That hurts,\"" he said.He has only four chicken houses, down from six, because of cuts in his contract with eastern poultry giant Perdue. Another national company, Pilgrim's Pride, shut down a Chatham County poultry plant last year.Britt said he is keeping his beef cattle longer, hoping prices go up, and he's thinking of planting vegetables, too. While he was eyeing farm equipment at the State Fairgrounds last week, he said he won't be invest tens of thousands of dollars in a new tractor or hay baler.\""Anyway we can hang tough, we're hanging tough,\"" Britt said.Like Britt, livestock farmers across the nation face the same sad math: The cost of feed and fuel they put into their operations rose 27 percent in the past four years, while the price they're fetching for meat products dropped 13 percent, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report this month.The soaring price of corn, brought on by gas prices and demand for corn-based ethanol, made feed for chicken, pigs and cows more expensive. Though gas and corn prices have eased some, they have not dropped to as low as they were before the spike.In the meantime, the deepening ***recession** has forced a growing legion of people to cut back on meat, from down the street to across the world in China.Some farmers who had only recently started exporting have seen foreign markets crash along with the global economy.The plummeting economy has affected demand for many agricultural products, sometimes in surprising or indirect ways.The sudden drop in the number of new homes being built has spelled disaster for the fast-growing nursery business, where commercial landscapers once made up a large percentage of purchases. The state's nurseries now bring in nearly $1 billion a year, ranking third among agricultural products in cash receipts.In Johnston County, where housing starts dropped nearly 40 percent last year, Cooperative Extension Director Bryant Spivey said nursery owners still reeling from the tight water restrictions that slowed plant sales two years ago might also see another drop in consumer demand. \""That's discretionary money that consumers might not put into lawn care\"" he said.Tobacco farmers are facing higher federal taxes on cigarettes, expected to push down demand for their crop -- a hardship agriculture economist Blake Brown says is related to the ***recession**.\""Governments looking for new sources of revenue may not have been seeking that revenue so aggressively if it had not been for the ***recession**,\"" Blake said.Even row crops and fresh vegetables -- a bright spot in recent years -- could suffer as consumers continue to cut back on spending, including farmers selling vegetables at the state's farmers markets.\""Now that people's budgets are tighter, they may say, 'Maybe I ought to go to Food Lion or Wal-Mart this week rather than buy something that looks better and tastes better,\"" Blake said.Dairy farmers expect a steep drop in the price they get for milk -- from about $2 a gallon to about $1.40 a gallon -- with no drop in their production costs. Many of them are expected to close up shop, adding to the rapid loss of dairy farms in the state.\""This is probably as bad as I've seen it,\"" said Geoff Benson, an economist at N.C. State who has tracked the dairy sector for more than 30 years. \""... I'm encouraging dairy farmers to really take a hard look at their finances and try to make a judgment if they really want to continue through the next cycle.\""These woes trickle out to equipment vendors and other businesses, as farmers, who generally expand and diversify during good years, cut back on purchases.\""They aren't buying much,\"" said James Cummings, who was trying to sell dairy equipment at the Southern Farm Show last week.But most experts doubt that the uncertainty brought on by the ***recession** will drive many people off the state's 48,000 farms. If anything, some farming families that once held outside jobs to stay afloat through the bad years might find that the farm, for a while at least, is the more stable pursuit.\""Most of the time when people get out, they either have to retire or find some alternative source of income,\"" said Spivey, the Johnston extension chief. \""Right now, the alternative sources I figure don't look all that great.\""marti.maguire@newsobserver.com or 919-829-4841To see more of The News &amp; Observer, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.newsobserver.com.

36,4T3V-FV90-TWSR-V1PP-00000-00.txt,"ELECTION '08 Give Curt Fackler points for determination. Four years ago, the Spokane business owner ran for state insurance commissioner on a simple platform: that the major health insurers in Washington - mostly not-for-profit companies - are collecting far more dollars than they're likely to ever need to pay medical claims. ""We've been overcharged,"" Fackler says, ""and we should get the money back."" If so, voters apparently weren't listening. Fackler came in third in the three-way Republican primary. He lost by a nearly 3-to-1 margin to a Seattle insurance broker whose greatest political asset was arguably his name: John Adams. And Adams lost to the Democratic incumbent, former Congressman Mike Kreidler. Four years later, all three men again are facing off for the same job. This time, however, Kreidler is campaigning on a plan to provide catastrophic health care coverage to every Washingtonian. It's one of several universal health care plans that state legislators are considering while still hoping for bigger changes from Congress and the next president. Rolling his plan out to lawmakers this past winter, Kreidler called it a well-grounded, workable plan that would protect people from being bankrupted by a health crisis. ""We have been tinkering with small or false solutions, playing on the margins for far too long,"" he told lawmakers in February. ""We need significant change."" Here's a look at the candidates.MIKE KREIDLER A retired optometrist, Kreidler was a longtime state lawmaker and former congressman when elected state insurance commissioner in 2000. Kreidler says he's a strong consumer advocate, citing his office's work to hold down insurance rate increases, speed up payouts to policyholders and take over bankrupt insurers to bring them back into the black. Kreidler also blocked Premera/Blue Cross's bid to convert to a for-profit company, saying it would not benefit policyholders. But the centerpiece of his campaign is Kreidler's ""Guaranteed Health Benefit Plan."" Under it: *All Washington residents would get catastrophic coverage for health emergencies costing more than $10,000 a year. *Some preventative care would be covered, including annual checkups and dental visits, immunizations and cancer screenings. *Consumers could choose additional coverage for other routine care. *All coverage would be through private insurers. To pay for the plan, Kreidler's calling for a payroll tax. Workers would pay 1 percent of their earnings. Small businesses would pay 3 percent of payroll; large businesses 5 percent. The tax and plan, he said, should be put before voters for approval. Under such a plan, Kreidler predicts that premiums for routine health care would drop as much as 40 percent. And medical bankruptcies and hospitals' costs for uncompensated care would also drop sharply. Kreidler says the current system - with 700,000 uninsured Washingtonians and hospitals and doctors annually trying to make up $600 million in unpaid care - is ""unsustainable,"" he says.JOHN ADAMS For a little-known candidate who raised just $4,500 and did little campaigning, John Adams did pretty well last time. He got 41 percent of the vote to Kreidler's 54 percent. Adams is the owner of the Seattle General Agency, an insurance brokerage. Among his specialities: marine insurance, including yachts, hang gliding and parasailing. On his three-page campaign Web site, Adams includes a picture of President John Adams and says that he - the Seattle Adams - ""comes from an historical Massachusetts family"" with a long and distinguished history of public service. The Republican's approach to health coverage would include limiting malpractice lawsuits, streamlining claims, buying drugs in bulk and boosting competition. Other campaign planks include reducing business regulations and calling for a performance audit to see how the office is doing. Adams vows to be ""both an advocate for consumers and regulator/protector of the insurance industry."" His Web site is  www.seattlegeneralagency.com/johnadams2008/.CURT FACKLER Although Fackler is chairman of the Spokane County Republican Party, he decided to list no party on the ballot. That's partly because it's a tough time to win votes as a Republican in Washington, he said at the time. He says it's also because he feels the post should be nonpartisan. ""Democrats, Republicans and Independents all buy insurance,"" he said. Fackler, who holds an MBA in finance, says not-for-profit insurance companies have built up unnecessary surpluses of more than $1.4 billion. That money, he said, should be repaid to policyholders. On his campaign Web site,  www.curtfackler.org, he has posted charts that show dramatic growth in insurance company reserves over the past eight years. In Olympia hearings, insurers have for years disputed the contention that their cash reserves are excessive. The economy is cyclical, they say, and the reserves are a critical cushion against unexpectedly high claims. Premera, in particular, has argued that cash on hand allows it to add customers more quickly.",0,,,

How will America make amends?"", ""When my mom describes it all now--10 months after she walked away from her house of 14 years--she sounds sort of crazy to me. I make her explain again and again, because the depth of her denial about the situation she faced is hard for me to understand. But that's the thing about losing stuff. Whether it's your keys or your life savings, it's tough getting to that moment when you realize something's gone for good.My mother, Carolyn White, and her husband, Earl, spent the first eight months of 2008 haggling with Countrywide Financial (now acquired by Bank of America), trying and failing to get their sub-prime loan modified into something they could pay. She and Earl, like so many other casualties of the sub-prime disaster, had refinanced their home to take out equity. Then the rate exploded, increasing their monthly payment by hundreds of dollars.\""It was like talking to a brick wall,\"" she complains with a resigned if annoyed tone, which once rang with fury instead. Several months into the effort, when it became clear things weren't going to work out, they started looking for a rental. \""Earl had gotten to the place where it didn't matter to him,\"" my mom explains. \""But I was fighting it tooth and nail to the end. Even when I was packing to move, I was thinking, 'Well, they're going to come up with something, and we can just unpack.'\""She'd already picked out a townhouse in her same neighborhood, on Indianapolis' solidly middle-class northwest side. She'd dutifully selected three favorites, actually, ranking them and putting in applications. Yet, she never expected to move. Even after they'd finally walked, my brother had to shout her down to keep her from going back and tidying up the property she'd abandoned. \""I just couldn't see myself leaving my house,\"" she says.At age 63, she's starting over on her American dream. A rented townhouse. New, smaller furniture. Family photos edited down and re-hung. A few framed wildlife prints as reminders of the Wyoming retirement home that had once felt within reach. They're middle-aged grandparents and middle-class by all outward appearances. But they're facing life like a couple of hard-pressed newlyweds.They're of course not alone. More than 10 percent of all mortgages were in default as 2008 ended. We logged more than 800,000 foreclosure filings in the first quarter of 2009, according to the Center for Responsible Lending, which projects 2.4 million this year.These are big, daunting numbers with which we're all becoming drearily familiar. But less familiar is the fact that this carnage has disproportionately hit people of color, particularly those who were old enough to have built up some equity when the sub-prime boom exploded.In 2006, African American borrowers at all income levels were three times as likely to be sold sub-prime loans than were their white counterparts, even those with comparable credit scores. The Pew Hispanic Center reports that 17.5 percent of whites took out sub-prime loans but that 44.9 percent of Hispanics and 52.5 percent of African Americans took out sub-prime loans. Blacks like my mom, who could qualify for conventional loans, were targeted for sub-prime ones, which generated higher fees for the lender and higher costs and risks for the borrower.Many of the places hit hardest by the first foreclosure wave--south Florida, the urban Midwest, cities like Oakland, Phoenix, Atlanta, and Detroit--had dense pockets of black and Latino homeowners, where slowly accumulated equity could be stripped away in ill-conceived refinances. As a result, one in 10 black borrowers is expected to foreclose, compared to one in 25 whites. And a United for a Fair Economy study last year estimated that black and Latino borrowers will absorb at least $164 billion in losses, or about half the nation's overall foreclosure toll.As devastating as those realities are in individual lives like my mom's, they also point to a broader, perhaps more lasting damage that's gone largely unexplored among policy-makers: The ***mortgage crisis** has further deepened racial inequality in America and should finally reshape our understanding of the relationship between race and class.HOMEOWNERSHIP HAS been a crucial building block of middle-class wealth ever since Jefferson promoted land-tenure laws that favored freeholders and Lincoln signed the Homestead Act. Today, housing represents nearly two-thirds of all middle-class wealth. That reliance on real property always underscored the racial chasm, first in the agricultural era, when blacks were slaves and then sharecroppers rather than landowners, and then later when decades of lending bias created a massive racial disparity in homeownership rates. Before the housing boom, in the early 1990s, 69 percent of whites owned homes compared to just 44 percent of blacks and 42 percent of Latinos.By 2004, the housing boom had improved those numbers. Fully three-quarters of white families owned homes, as did nearly half of both black and Latino families. As the homeownership picture improved, so too did the wealth picture, though at a glacial rate. The racial disparity in net worth is among the most astounding statistics in modern economics. For every dollar of wealth the median white family held back in 2002, similar black families had just 7 cents, while Latinos had just 9 cents. By 2007, black families had a dime for every dollar of white family wealth, and Hispanics, 12 cents. This was progress, if glacial.Then came the bust. The housing boom proved to be just another trapdoor in a centuries-long game of Chutes and Ladders for black and brown strivers. By 2007, the black homeownership rate had plunged nearly three points, to 47 percent, a larger drop than among any other group, and is probably lower today. Worse, the damage is concentrated in what were once sturdy black middle-class neighborhoods.IN 21ST-CENTURY America--a society that boasts equality under the law, African American CEOs, and Barack Obama--the black middle-class story is widely understood as a congratulatory tale of uniquely American success. As Obama declared in his first words as president-elect, \""If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible ... tonight is your answer.\""Perhaps. It's clear that at all stages of life--from education to workplace to life expectancy--success still tracks closely with race. And the massive black underclass--nearly a quarter of all black households live in poverty, according to the Census Bureau--is proof of lasting structural inequality. But to truly understand the relationship between race and opportunity in modern America, you must take a real look at the seemingly vibrant black bourgeoisie.Doing so means fundamentally changing the way we measure class. For years, scholars have primarily turned to one of three measures to identify the middle class: occupation, income, and educational achievement. If you're a professional or a manager, if your income falls in the middle 60 percent of the national bell curve, or if you've graduated college, you fit into one or another researcher's definition. And by any of those three measures, my mother's generation posted remarkable gains for people of color.In 1960, as my mom was entering high school, around 750,000 blacks had middle-class jobs. By 1995, nearly 7 million blacks had such jobs. That's a growth of more than seven fold in one adult lifetime. And the explosion of college-educated blacks is equally impressive. As my mom was finishing college in 1967, just 4 percent of blacks over the age of 25 had matched her achievement; in 2007, 18.5 percent had done so.Latinos born in the United States went from making up just 3 percent of middle-income adults in 1970 to 13 percent in 2006--the largest increase among any race or ethnic group. They also saw a 17 percent spike on the Pew Hispanic Center's income index, compared to just 6 percent for whites. The American middle-class may still be awfully white, but it's sure gotten some color in my mother's lifetime.There are, of course, significant qualifiers to all of this. Most important, the gap between black and white rates of achievement in all three areas--occupation, income, and education--has not improved nearly as much as the absolute number of blacks meeting the given standard. But the conventional measures of middle-class status share a much more damning flaw. They all fail to consider the more nuanced characteristics of middle-class life that most everyday families would identify as their most prized treasures: long-term security, social stability, and the ability to pass both on to your kids in greater portions than you've enjoyed them.These things aren't measured just by how much money you make or by what degree and job title you hold; they're measured by how much wealth you can draw upon when times get tough or an opportunity comes around, and how much you can pass along to give your kids a head start. The upper middle class helps its children with everything from college tuitions to down payments. That wealth cushion is built on financial savings and investments for some. For most, it's equity in a home.THE IDEA OF VIEWING economic progress through the lens of wealth rather than income emerged in the mid-1980s. It allows researchers to calculate what's been called the \""asset poverty line\""--or being able to maintain a standard of living above the federal poverty level for at least three months without income. When you lose a job or get hit with a huge hospital bill or, well, get socked by a foreclosure, can you cushion the blow while getting a fresh start? Do you have strong enough bootstraps to pull yourself back up, as it were?The answers are sobering. One in five families that were middle class in 2004 couldn't make it three months on assets alone, according to a Corporation for Economic Development analysis of Census data. In other words, when you look at wealth, the income-based poverty rate doubles. And that was before the housing bubble burst.If you then apply a racial lens to these asset-based measures, the disparities are awesome. Roughly 40 percent of both blacks and Latinos lived below the asset poverty line in 2004. As pioneering sociologist Thomas Shapiro sums it up in a 2006 paper, \""Two families with similar incomes but widely disparate wealth most likely do not share similar life trajectories.\""The 2001 ***recession** proves the point. Everybody gained some ground in the roaring 1990s, but not everybody took the subsequent slowdown the same. While the median white household emerged in 2002 with a modest 2 percent increase in net worth, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, Latinos lost more than 25 percent of their wealth between 1999 and 2001. People of color, Shapiro explains, burned through their meager assets and piled on extra debt to make it through the early-century tough times. Many likely got expensive, sub-prime refinances like the one my mom and Earl took out.MY MOM WON'T LET ON about it now, but she always liked saying \""my house.\"" She was a renter from the time she and my father divorced back in the mid-1980s until she and Earl bought their house in 1994. I was away at college at the time, and whenever I visited Indy, she'd made some tinkering improvement. Even as she packed last summer, she gamed out how she'd pull up the living room carpet--it was too much to keep clean--and how she'd put in a backyard deck. \""I had wanted that since we moved in,\"" she says.They bought the house for around $120,000, she says, with a fixed-rate, 30-year loan. It's the sort of mortgage that the GI bill and Federal Housing Administration spurred into existence back in the postwar years in order to broaden the American homeownership dream. And it's the sort of loan black families couldn't get for decades, due to banks' redlining of black neighborhoods. Epic fair-lending battles put an end to codified discrimination, and by the time my mom and Earl went looking for money to buy their home, they didn't have trouble finding it.Nor did they have a problem in 1996, when they first took out some equity, in an effort to catch up on less-sensible debt. Their payments went up a bit, but they got the money out and paid some things off and, all things considered, were rolling along. They started vacationing out West, discovered their shared love of the peaceful dessert landscape, even bought a gas-guzzling RV to travel back and forth. They still subscribe to a Jackson Hole, Wyoming, newspaper.The problems didn't start until they got a second refinance as the 2001 ***recession** waned. Earl had hoped to use the equity to make some new investments, make their money grow in slow times. But a few years later, their rapidly inflating loan payments were eating their monthly budget. It was a steep, rapid decline from there to zero equity, re-accumulated debt, and a delayed retirement.Their experience and those of millions of others point to a confounding irony that home equity has presented for efforts to close the racial wealth gap. On the one hand, because homeownership was key to 20th-century wealth, the huge racial disparity in ownership rates helped drive the disparity in wealth, too. On the other hand, the wealth blacks and Latinos have managed to accumulate is dangerously dependent on home equity alone, leaving them vulnerable in times like these. According to Shapiro and his research partner, Melvin Oliver, while homeownership accounts for 63 percent of average black net worth, it accounts for just 38.5 percent of average white net worth. We cannot afford the $1.19 trillion in American home equity taken out in refinances between 2003 and 2007.IF NOTHING ELSE, the wealth perspective on economic progress challenges America's creation myth of hardworking pilgrims, self-made frontiersmen, and brass-balled industrialists. In reality, our middle class looks an awful lot like an aristocracy built on inherited middle-class advantage.For his 2004 book, The Hidden Cost of Being African American, Shapiro culled through household survey data for the early 1990s--pre-sub-prime boom--and found this gem: Just about half of all white buyers said they got assistance from their parents to make a down payment, while just 12 percent of black buyers said the same. This matters. Put down more money, and you get more house, less debt, more wealth with which to start your life. In researching the book, Shapiro found the same pattern across the board on family finances: young black households were far more likely to spend resources helping out their parents and siblings, while young white ones were more likely to be receiving help from their parents.This offers a key example of the way in which racial inequality is passed on from generation to generation--and has been shepherded along by government policy. It started with Reconstruction's failures and has tumbled forward generation after generation.Black abolitionists viewed emancipation as more than the end of slavery; it was also to involve the creation of economic opportunity. The idea of \""reparations\"" seems silly 150 years removed, but the nation faced a massive debate over land redistribution following the Civil War. As one freedman told a reporter, \""Give us our land and we can take care of ourselves, but without land the old masters can hire us or starve us, as they please.\""The administrations of first Abraham Lincoln and then Andrew Johnson, however, envisioned freed blacks as wage laborers, not landowners. When Johnson ordered Dixie's land returned to Southern planters in 1865--and thousands of freed slaves evicted--it solidified a governing perspective that would echo forward to the modern era: People of color would receive subsistence aid, but wealth-buttressing subsidies would be limited to whites.The examples are myriad, as Meizhu Lui of the Insight Center for Community Economic Development points out in a recent paper. The Homestead Acts of the 1860s, for instance, took vast swaths of land from Native American tribes and gave it away in 160-acre plots to white settlers, to jump start the agricultural sector; for freedmen, land never materialized. More than a century later, 400 black farmers won a class-action lawsuit against the Department of Agriculture for its systematic racial bias in providing loans and other assistance to farmers throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Lo and behold, at the turn of the 21st-century, white Americans still held 97 percent of the nation's agricultural land value.The New Deal programs that created today's middle class, meanwhile, are also directly responsible for today's wealth gap. Name a massive government investment, and you've got an initiative that explicitly or implicitly excluded people of color. By 1965, 98 percent of the 10 million homes public money had helped buy through loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration were owned by whites. Government then spent years more ignoring private lenders' redlining of black neighborhoods.The proven racial bias in today's sub-prime lending, then, is more normative than exceptional. As Lui wrote in a March Washington Post op-ed, \""The chips on the table reflect the fact that the game was fixed. It's time to start an honest game with a new deck.\""So how do we do that? A black president aside, the feds aren't likely to hand out that 40 acres and a mule anytime soon.Sadly, congressional Democrats and the White House have not yet shown enough political courage to merely stop the mounting foreclosure losses, never mind start building new wealth. They have repeatedly allowed the banking lobby to block any measure, such as loan modifications by a bankruptcy judge, that would give struggling borrowers enough leverage to demand a fair deal. And there's little evidence, thus far, that the billions in incentives President Obama has begun handing the mortgage industry will spur enough real mortgage modifications to keep pace with foreclosures.Meanwhile, even before policy-makers figure out how to slow foreclosures, communities that have been overwhelmed by them--in abandoned houses, increased crime, falling home prices, and more-are going to need significant public investment. The $6 billion Congress has allocated in the past year for \""neighborhood stabilization\"" is clearly a mere down payment and will need to be spent creatively.But more broadly, at some point the public sector is going to have to make the same massive investment in wealth creation for people of color that it has made for generations of whites. In some cases, that means tweaking existing policies--the home-mortgage tax deduction, for instance, is currently useless to people who don't make enough to itemize. But it's also going to mean recreating big, bold initiatives like those that created the wealth gap in the first place.Whatever the plan, it will not be a small endeavor. My mom's outlook these days reveals just how much ground has been lost--not just in dollars and cents but in the emotional toll millions of families have paid. She's traveled all the way from denial to resignation and now wants out of the maddening ownership conversation altogether. \""If I don't get another house, I don't really care,\"" she scoffs.She's prepared to approach opportunity like generations of black folks before her--living on the money she makes, pooling family and community resources when that's not enough. So after retiring from 28 years of teaching grade school, she's gone back to the classroom as a teaching aide. \""I won't say I'm happy,\"" she concludes, \""but I'm content with it.\"" The real question, of course, is whether America is equally content with the legacy of inequality this housing meltdown has deepened. If not, are we prepared to finally confront it?""

38,7W92-W440-Y9NR-M01M-00000-00.txt,"    Remember that $76 million stimulus windfall for local schools? The Anchorage School District now says it's getting $17 million less than that because of an accounting mistake. The mistake happened because, as district spokeswoman Heidi Embley explains it, there are two phases to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds. When the Alaska Department of Education told the Anchorage School District how much it was getting, the district official believed it was only for the first phase. Turns out it was for both phases. While most districts around the country are using the stimulus money to desperately plug holes in budgets left depleted by ***recession**-caused drops in tax collections, Anchorage is treating it like lottery winnings. Money is going toward technology upgrades, building projects, new books and learning materials, and anti-dropout programs. With less money, fewer of those will be funded, school officials said.  The new 2009-2010 district budget is $830 million for its 50,000 students. Projects being tabled include things like updating the social studies curriculum for kindergarten through third grade. Other items are still being bought, just fewer of them, like netbooks, which are children's laptops. Priorities like hiring more reading coaches and funding pilot programs aimed at reducing the high drop-out rate are still in the budget, said Anchorage superintendent Carol Comeau. School maintenance jobs were prioritized in the new budget. ""Some of the most critical, shovel-ready, smaller projects are the ones we will be keeping,"" Comeau said. The ones lower on the list will be delayed. ""We'll just keep looking at different ways to accomplish those,"" she said. The state Department of Education informed the Anchorage district of its mistake. It doesn't appear that the other 20-some districts that have turned in their paperwork made the same error, said department spokesman Eric Fry.Alaska K-12 education is slated to get a total of $93 million from the federal government in education fiscal stabilization funds, to be used over the next two years. Another $29 million is being distributed to the state's poorest schools. And some $34 million is going toward special education across the state.

39,4SGS-95C0-TW87-N1D0-00000-00.txt,"There was an epic real estate bust, and it spurred a ***financial crisis** so profound that it dragged down the entire U.S. economy. The Washington area felt it more than most, shedding jobs at more than twice the pace of the nation as a whole.It was 1991, not 2008. It was a commercial real estate bubble that burst, not residential. And it was savings and loans that destabilized the financial system, not an alphabet soup of complex securities like MBSs, CDOs and CLOs.In local business circles, the notion that the Washington area is insulated from the vicissitudes of national economic trends is so commonly articulated as to be a cliche.But the experience of the early 1990s shows that it isn't necessarily so. What happens during this downturn depends on how much further housing prices and sales activity fall and whether the federal government becomes more frugal.There is no question that the region has somewhat  different economic strengths -- namely government spending and a highly educated workforce. And in the 2001 ***recession** and slow recovery that followed, Washington endured only modest pain, despite a concentration of the telecom and other technology companies that were the victims of the tech bust. In 2002, when the nation's employment fell by 1.1 percent, the number of jobs in the Washington area actually rose 0.3 percent.Many of the region's veteran executives  think the current downturn will  be more like 2001 than like 1991.""There is a slowdown, but it is nowhere near as severe as the one we had back in the '90s,"" said James W. Dyke, a partner at  McGuire Woods law firm, who has led several Northern Virginia business organizations. ""With the federal government, you have that extra cushion.""""We're not totally immune from what's going on in the rest of the country,"" said William Couper, president of Bank of America in the region and chairman of the Greater Washington Board of Trade. ""But the Washington area has made a substantial transformation in these last 15 years that has made us better able to weather periods like this.""So far, the numbers back them up. In 2006, job growth in the Washington area  was  near the same pace as the nation as a whole, about 1.8 percent. In the past year, companies have slowed their rate of job creation. But in the Washington area, the number of jobs rose 0.8 percent in the year ended in March, twice the pace of the nation.Similarly, the unemployment rate in the Washington area has been rising, to 3.4 percent in March from 2.9 percent a year earlier. But that was still well below the 5.1 percent national rate. The local jobless rate will probably stay below the national one because this region has a disproportionate share of college-educated workers, who historically have much lower levels of unemployment than less-educated counterparts.So the local economy doesn't appear to be falling off a cliff, at least according to conventional indicators. But understanding how much the housing and ***financial crisis** will ripple through  the coming year is a lot more complicated.Economic downturns amount to a working out of imbalances. If you want to know where the pain will be greatest, look to where the imbalances were the greatest.Money was too cheap. Too many houses were built, and they  sold  for too much.  That led to Americans spending more than they could really afford.It's easy to identify some places where those excesses were at their worst. In Miami, for example, home prices rose 181 percent from 2000 to 2006, as calculated by the Case-Schiller Index, while the average income rose  30 percent. That made it far more difficult for people to afford a house, even with lower mortgage rates. The same is true in much of the Sun Belt: Southern California, Nevada and most of Florida. Those places are already undergoing a painful adjustment, with  housing prices falling and joblessness rising.So how much does the Washington economy need to adjust? Not as much as those cities, perhaps, but more than a lot of the  nation, where home prices didn't increase as much. The average home price here rose 140 percent, while per-capita income grew 27 percent.People in the real estate industry say that while prices are dropping in most of the region, the major damage -- steep price declines, foreclosures and such -- will probably be confined to parts of Prince William, Loudoun  and Prince George's counties, where there was the most speculative building and lending activity.In the region, a lack of building activity and related loss of construction and related jobs, is likely to persist. ""What's similar to the early '90s is there's really no bank financing for development right now,"" said Robert Kettler, whose firm, Kettler Inc., has built more than 50,000 housing units over the past quarter-century. ""The banks are more conservative, so it's harder to birth projects, and that has a ripple effect on everyone involved in the business.""The housing downturn so far does not appear to have led to a massive drop in consumer spending.""It's a shift,"" said Tammy Darvish, vice president of Darcars Automotive Group and chairman of the Washington Area New Automobile Dealers Association. ""Maybe instead of a big-ticket Suburban people are getting a smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicle.""But whether this downturn is more like 1990 or 2001 locally may come down to a rather different factor: Uncle Sam.In the early '90s, as the Cold War ended and the budget deficit was getting out of control, the federal government pulled back in its contracts with defense and other contractors, a major driver of jobs in Washington. But in the early 2000s, the ramp-up of defense spending kept the local economy growing.So what is happening today? There are some parallels to the early '90s, as budget deficits are on the rise and many of the homeland security contracts initiated in the early years of the decade start to wind down. But few are predicting a pullback on the order of the early  '90s. Investors have been optimistic about government spending in recent months, pushing up the stocks of big contractors.""Government agencies aren't slowing down much, but it is stretching things, using more of a phased approach,"" said Dyke of McGuire Woods. ""It's: 'We're going to keep this project, but we're going to stretch it out a little longer so it costs less in any one period.' That will have a ripple effect.""",1,,,
40,4SSK-XX90-TX4X-X0YH-00000-00.txt,"Among the scores of lenders that have halted student loans because of the credit crisis are several state-based agencies that serve tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of residents.Despite last month's unprecedented action by Congress and the Bush administration to shore up the student-loan industry, some of those state-authorized organizations say they may not return to the loan business this year, and others are cutting some of the borrower benefits and services they provide.Financial-aid experts are assuring families and students that plenty of companies remain willing to issue loans through the federally subsidized loan program, known as the Federal Family Education Loan program. But borrowers who cannot secure money from state authorities will probably pay higher interest rates and more fees to get either federal or private loans from banks and other for-profit lenders. State lenders usually offer below-market interest rates to residents and provide other services meant to ease students' debt burdens.Nine state loan agencies stopped issuing either new federally backed or new private loans this year, according to the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. Those agencies are in Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania organization has also announced that it will reduce the grants it makes to about 160,000 low- and middle-income students by an average of $500.In response to the recently crafted federal rescue plan, agencies in Kentucky, Missouri, and New Hampshire have announced that they will resume lending this year. The federal action assures both private and nonprofit lenders, such as the state authorities, that they can sell new loans to the Department of Education or receive a low-interest line of credit to issue those loans.However, the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority says it will not be able to offer the interest-rate cuts it had previously given to borrowers who make payments through automatic bank withdrawals. It will also suspend a program that offered an interest rate as low as 0.25 percent for graduates who stay in the state to work as teachers, nurses, police officers, firefighters, paramedics, social-service workers, state employees, or members of the National Guard or Reserves.The other state lenders that suspended some programs say they are still uncertain whether they will take advantage of the federal offer. They are not sure whether the Education Department will allow them to service the loans that are bought by the federal government, and more importantly, to collect the service fees.""The department has not really closed the deal,"" said Peter Warren, a senior vice president of the Education Finance Council, an association of nonprofit lenders that includes state agencies. Mr. Warren said state-based and other nonprofit lenders are waiting to see the final rules for loan servicing under the federal rescue plan, which have not been published.If state authorities have to give up servicing the loans they sell to the Education Department, Mr. Warren argued, students are more likely to default because they may have to deal with more than one lender for payments and deferments.Although they are not always as well known as the commercial lenders, state authorities often issue the most federal student loans in their states. Twenty-eight of them are among the top 100 holders of federally guaranteed student loans in the nation, according to the U.S. Department of Education. The Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, the largest state loan authority, is ranked sixth among all lenders nationally and holds nearly $12-billion in federal student loans.State lenders are generally given a portion of a state's tax-exempt bonds to use to issue new federally backed or private loans or to purchase existing loans from private lenders. Because the income from the bonds is free from state and federal taxes, investors are often willing to accept lower interest rates, which means the cost of financing that debt is lower for the states.Because their financing costs are lower, many state loan authorities can afford to tailor their programs to the special needs of their residents and offer lower interest rates than private lenders. For example, New Jersey operates a loan program for low-income students with a fixed interest rate that is below the market rate offered by private lenders. Last year Illinois began a private loan program that is meant to help undergraduates in their senior year finish their degrees and offers them an interest-rate cut of up to three percentage points if they work in the state after graduation.State authorities ran into financial trouble this year, though, when sales of auction-rate securities, in which interest rates on bonds are reset frequently, ground to a halt, doubling or tripling the costs of paying off those bonds. For instance, the Montana Higher Education Student Assistance Corporation has issued $1.1-billion in auction-rate bonds, more than half its total holdings, upon which the interest rate is reset every 35 days by auction. By April the cost of paying off those bonds had risen by $14-million over nine months, putting the Montana agency into the red for the first time.The problems in the auction-rate market hit state lenders particularly hard because they don't have commercial banks' ability to borrow funds through the Federal Reserve or use money from other lines of business, such as car loans or credit cards, to pay for losses in their student-loan operations, said Justin Draeger, associate director of communications for the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.Elizabeth L. Bordowitz, acting chief executive of the Finance Authority of Maine, said her agency had survived the turbulent markets with a little luck and good timing. The Maine authority sold $109-million in bonds one year ago, an amount expected to meet their demands for loans this academic year. The Vermont Student Assistance Corporation has found another way to continue to offer loans, by forming a partnership with a commercial bank, which has agreed to give the nonprofit agency a $230-million line of credit to do business in the coming academic year.But the credit crunch combined with cuts Congress made to federal student-loan subsidies last fall are making some state-based lenders question whether they can afford to continue in the federal loan program. Will Shaffner, director of business development at the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, said the federal rescue plan is ""a good first step"" but doesn't ease the longer-term problems both public and private lenders see with the federal program. Congress has cut subsidies to federal-loan providers without considering the costs and benefits of all the services, such as credit counseling, that nonprofit lenders provide to students and their families, Mr. Shaffner said.Meanwhile, lenders have come under scrutiny after the nationwide investigation into conflicts of interest in the student-loan industry led by New York's attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo. Other recent investigations also raised questions about whether state lenders are using their money in the public interest.A 2007 state audit showed that the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency awarded $7.5-million in bonuses to top employees over three years and that a dozen of the agency's executives are paid more than the state's governor, Edward G. Rendell, whose annual salary is $164,500. Similarly, a state audit of the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority released last year found, among other things, that four former executives were paid nearly $2.3-million in severance pay and benefits while five executives earned annual performance bonuses in amounts that totaled $1.5-million over three years.The scandals have made consumer watchdog groups and some politicians skeptical about whether the state-based lenders, which have increased their holdings by 20 percent over the past decade, are simply trying to bolster their bottom lines at the expense of students and taxpayers. Robert M. Shireman, executive director of the Project on Student Debt, said that allowing lenders to keep the servicing fees for loans owned by the federal government would be a ""hazardous proposal for taxpayers.""""They want a front-end guarantee to money over the long term,"" Mr. Shireman said. Locking that in for 20 years, he said, ""is something that the government can't afford to do.""",0,,,
41,4VDJ-3KF0-TXJ7-F0CX-00000-00.txt,"A new set of guidelines has given bankers a better idea of how regulators will evaluate their use of remote check-image capture services, and it might prompt financial companies to accelerate their use of the technology, according to market watchers.The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's guidelines warn that banks should consider remote capture not just a service but a new delivery system requiring top-level oversight.Daniel J. McCarty, the senior vice president of treasury management at Comerica Inc.in Dallas, said he believed the guidance would stimulate some laggard banks to introduce the service.""We've gotten a lot of questions from our correspondents about where this guidance will go,"" Mr. McCarty said. ""Now that the guidance is there, you can determine whether you're in compliance. You know what you're going to be measured against.""But more remote capture would also lead to more check returns as customers double-deposit checks, either by accident or fraudulently, which should cause banks to demand information about these returns of the sort available on automated clearing house or wire transfer returns, said Mr. McCarty, who also is chairman of the payment systems committee of the American Bankers Association.""As this system becomes more ACH-like, more electronic, you have the opportunity to do that clarification so you can conduct the process better,"" he said. ""Better information about return codes will lead us to an even better, tighter process.""John Leekley, the founder and chief executive of the consulting firm RemoteDepositCapture LLC in Atlanta, said bankers will need to consider carefully how they introduce the service.""Remote deposit capture is really a different animal,"" he said. ""It's different for every customer. It's different for every bank.""Bob Meara, a senior analyst at Celent LLC in Boston, the financial research arm of Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. Inc.'s Oliver Wyman consulting unit, said the guidelines that were released Wednesday by the FFIEC, a coordinating group for federal and state regulators, will reduce the fear and uncertainty that many banks felt about remote capture.""The best part of this guidance is that it's finally published,"" Mr. Meara said. ""I don't think this throws a wrench in the works as some feared it might.""Bankers were aware the FFIEC was drafting the guidelines, and some had feared that they would require significant changes in current processes, such as ""physical franking of items,"" Mr. Meara said.Nacha, the electronic payments association, requires franking for checks that are converted to automated clearing house payments at the point of presentment; typically, the scanner puts a stamp on the check.But check imaging does not require such a stamp. The FFIEC guidance is silent on that point, averting a potential burden on banks that already have deployed scanners to customers, and it leaves them flexibility to pursue their own risk management strategies, Mr. Meara said.William Henley, the director of information technology examinations at the Office of Thrift Supervision, said the FFIEC specifically chose to offer principles rather than prescriptions on how banks should address remote capture.""With respect to technology, we try to avoid being prescriptive,"" he said. ""If we try to be prescriptive, as the technology evolves, we're always playing catch-up.""The nine-page guidance document gives lengthy lists of issues that banks should consider when drafting the legal agreements covering their remote capture services and assessing their operational risks. It also puts some emphasis on the more complex issues that some institutions may face, such as the use of least-cost routing systems to determine whether to clear a check as an image or convert it to an ACH transaction and working with cross-border customers who may be outside U.S. legal jurisdiction.Mr. Leekley said cross-border issues would merit attention.""International cash letter used to be the exclusive province of a small group of large institutions,"" said Mr. Leekley, who once ran such an operation for Deutsche Bank in New York. ""Today, small-town bank USA can offer remote deposit capture to anybody. It is inherently a riskier proposition than domestic deposit and clearing.""The guidance takes effective immediately for all examinations and may require that institutions train not only their own employees but also the customers to whom they offer the service, Mr. Henley said.Mr. Leekley said that banks have been cautious about introducing the service, offering it first to large corporate clients. In the last 18 months they have they offered it to consumers, he said, estimating that the industry has 75,000 consumer and small-business customers for remote capture.This may change as institutions struggle to attract deposits during the credit crisis, Mr. Leekley said, arguing that the greater value of remote capture is in the additional deposits rather than the fees.""Banks are realizing that it's not about the fees,"" he said. ""It's about the deposits.""",0,,,
42,7Y8B-29W0-YBKJ-B1F2-00000-00.txt,"(RTTNews) - Malaysia&amp;apos;s economic contraction eased in the third quarter, in line with the global economic recovery, suggesting that the economy is likely to recover from the ***recession** soon.Gross domestic product fell 1.2% year-on-year in the third quarter after falling 3.9% in the second quarter, the Bank Negara Malaysia said Friday. Economists were looking for a decline of 2%.The central bank said the growth impetus emanated mainly from domestic demand, as a result of stronger private consumption and higher public sector spending. The Malaysian economy has been contracting since the first quarter of 2009, when the GDP declined 6.2%.Recovery in Malaysia is undeniably taking place and nicely supported by a resilient domestic demand and improving external economic conditions, the Singapore-based DBS Bank said. Malaysia&amp;apos;s external driven sectors will continue to benefit from the global recovery process, the bank said, and these positive effects could gradually broaden out to the domestic segments of the economy.""Domestically, although the Federal Government will be working on a tighter fiscal target next year, benefits of this year&amp;apos;s aggressive fiscal policies (including the two stimulus packages) will likely spill over to 2010,"" DBS economists said in a note.Malaysia could return to moderately high growth in 2010, the World bank said in a report on Wednesday. The lender expects the economy to contract 2.3% this year, but grow 4.1% in the next year.""Managing the recovery will be a delicate balancing act,"" the World Bank said in its new report for the Malaysian economy. ""Withdrawing policy support too early runs the risk of choking off the recovery, whereas extending support for too long could hamper efforts to reduce government deficits and debt accumulation.""Final consumption expenditure expanded further by 3.3% on-year in the third quarter after registering a marginal growth of 0.6% in the second quarter. Growth in private consumption expenditure accelerated to 1.5% from 0.5% in the last quarter. That was driven by improved labor market conditions, lower price levels and higher spending for the festive season.Meanwhile, government final consumption expenditure grew at a stronger pace of 10.9%. The strong public investment provided support to gross fixed capital formation, which contracted at a more moderate pace of 7.9% compared to a 9.6% drop in the second quarter, as private investment remained subdued.The external sector continued its negative momentum with both exports and imports declining by 13.4% and 12.9%, respectively. Deceleration in exports was due to lower demand for electrical and electronics products and petroleum products in the external market.The next several quarters should benefit from continued improvements in exports and private consumption, the World Bank report said. ""Better export performance will fuel private consumption, as will the lagged effects of recent stimulus packages.""Meanwhile, the contraction in imports was due to the reduction in the imports of intermediate goods and capital goods. The decline in the manufacturing sector has narrowed to 8.6% in the third quarter from 14.5% in the previous quarter.Looking ahead, the central bank said the domestic economy is set to register positive growth in the months ahead. ""The Malaysian economy has exhibited stronger signs of improvement in the third quarter and evidence suggests that domestic economic activity is gaining strength.""The central bank said the pace of economic recovery is expected to gain momentum, as business and consumer sentiment improve further. In addition, the gradual improvement in the global economy will continue to contribute positively to the recovery of the domestic economy. Moreover, the central bank said the country&amp;apos;s financial sector remained resilient with strong capitalization, high asset quality, ample liquidity and continued profitability in the third quarter.For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.comCopyright(c) 2009 RTTNews.com, Inc.

43,4TJX-0W20-TX12-N023-00000-00.txt,"c(""Sep. 30--New Mexico's two candidates for U.S. Senate -- Democrat Tom Udall and Republican Steve Pearce -- don't agree on much, but Monday they came together and voted against the unpopular $700 billion \""bailout\"" bill in the House of Representatives.The bill failed in the House by a vote of 205 to 228. Udall was among the 95 Democrats who voted against the bill. Pearce was with the 133 Republicans who voted against it. A majority of Democrats voted for the bill, while Republicans voted overwhelmingly against it.Both Udall and Pearce said the bill was a boon to Wall Street companies and executives who helped create the ***financial crisis**. Both said the bill didn't do enough to protect taxpayers.But the two Congressmen disagreed on other reasons for voting against the bill. Udall, the liberal Democrat, said the bill needed to provide more government oversight over financial institutions. Pearce, the conservative Republican, said the bill didn't have \""market solutions\"" -- which translates to less oversight.Udall, in a news release, said despite the changes to Bush's original proposal, the bill still contained \""significant flaws.\"" He said there wouldn't be \""adequate oversight or an actual plan for fixing the systemic problems that led America to this crisis.\""\""Corporate executives who ran their companies into the ground can still walk away with millions in taxpayer-funded golden parachutes,\"" Udall said. He also argued that taxpayer dollars would be spent to bail out foreign companies and that the bill didn't do enough to help \""responsible homeowners\"" who \""could lose billions in assets as foreclosures continue to drive down property values.\""Pearce released a statement saying, \""New Mexico taxpayers were not protected under this legislation.

Obama also stressed the importance of addressing global trade imbalances.The White House said after the meeting that Obama and Yang discussed the overall state of U.S.-China bilateral relationship, emphasizing the desire of both sides to strengthen cooperation and build a positive and constructive relationship between the two countries.A statement issued after the meeting said the two agreed that China and the U.S. must work closely and urgently to stabilize the global economy by stimulating demand at home and abroad, and get credit markets flowing.Thursday&amp;apos;s talks at the White House Oval Office also touched on human rights, Tibet, the humanitarian crisis in Sudan&amp;apos;s Darfur region, the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan besides the six-party North Korean nuclear talks and Pyongyang&amp;apos;s missile program.Earlier Thursday, Yang said the U.S. and China should work together to overcome the global ***economic crisis** and fight the threat of protectionism.He also said a planned meeting between President Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao in London next month--the first meeting between the two since the U.S. president took office--is of great importance to U.S.-China ties.

46,7V4Y-9V90-Y8Y9-X0HJ-00000-00.txt,"SACRAMENTO -- Even during this deep ***recession**, California's air-quality regulators are on an accelerated schedule to adopt a series of global warming initiatives considered unmatched worldwide.Their aggressive push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming will eventually touch everyday life in both small and significant ways.Just Thursday, the state Air Resources Board moved to regulate fluorinated gases commonly used by the Silicon Valley-centered semiconductor industry to make chips used in cell phones and computers.A few weeks earlier, do-it-yourself mechanics were the target. Regulators adopted tighter rules on small cans of refrigerants that recharge vehicle air conditioners, potentially adding $1 to each can starting next year. To encourage recycling, regulators also imposed a refundable $10-per-can deposit -- a leak of just 12 ounces produces as much greenhouse gas as a car burning 50 gallons of gas.Even more regulations are on the way, practically every month for the next two years.Among the measures under review: fees on gas-guzzling vehicles, taxes on energy producers, rebates for junking old refrigerators, automatic tire pressure checks during smog checks and oil changes, and cleaner fuels for home heating and cooling.The agenda also includes the nation's first program to reduce the carbon content in transportation fuels, launching a business-friendly trading market for emission credits, and continuing the state's campaign to cut tailpipe emissions.The 65 pending initiatives, when coupled with several others that have been adopted, could eliminate as much as 125 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually starting in 2020. With 33.5 million vehicles registered, the state estimates that cutting 1 million tons of emissions is equivalent to taking 200,000 cars off the road for a year.But at what price? In this sour economy, many of those affected -- automakers, small businesses and smokestack industries -- are struggling to keep their doors open, much less invest in clean technology.""When is a good time to do this?"" said Sandra Berg, a member of the Air Resources Board. ""There's always an opportunity to put things off. The reality is we need to tackle this issue now.""Berg, president of Ellis Paint Co. in Los Angeles, said the board is purposely phasing in regulations to delay the steepest costs for when the economy rebounds.""It is an unsettling time,"" she said.Nevertheless, she said putting off curbing emissions and cutting energy consumption will increase the threat of global warming, weaken clean-air efforts and add to the toll that pollution takes on public health.""Then, for sure, we implode,"" Berg said.Many businesses are not convinced, particularly because the final bill remains a mystery.""There needs to be an economic analysis done so we know the regulation is the most cost-effective and technologically feasible,"" said Shelly Sullivan, representing a coalition of business groups.The measures will help implement the state's landmark plan to cut 174 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, an approximately 25 percent reduction from 1990 levels.Supporters of the strategy, including Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, warn that global warming could disrupt climatic patterns. That would bring longer droughts, increase the frequency and intensity of forest fires and imperil wildlife.Rather than a drag on the economy, some see the regulations as an ignition switch for job-creating technologies.""This is the playbook on how to rebuild our economy,"" said Bernadette Del Chiaro, a climate change specialist for Environment California, an advocacy group.San Diego County Supervisor Ron Roberts, an air board member, said he has visited companies on the verge of breakthroughs that will benefit the economy and the environment.""We've had successes,"" Roberts said.Also, the programs will do more than help curb global warming, he said.""There are ancillary benefits, for sure -- energy independence, reduction in other pollutants,"" Roberts said.Some Republican legislators are skeptical. The air board's overall policy recently survived a challenge by GOP lawmakers, who were using the state budget stalemate to wring environmental concessions out of Democrats, including weakening the global warming campaign.Sen. Robert Dutton, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has introduced legislation, SB 295, to freeze implementation until the state's unemployment rate -- edging above 10 percent in January -- dips below 5.8 percent.Roberts said regulators are always willing to revisit programs if the economic toll is too high. But industry has not presented enough ""compelling evidence"" to slow progress, he said.This year, regulators will wrap up about 15 programs by the end of the year, and a dozen measures in 2010. About 30 others either have been approved or are being developed. Still others are considered benign enough to be voluntary. Implementation dates are generally phased in, with the key deadline for compliance centered on 2020.Several programs are much more far-reaching, controversial and complex than others. For example, regulators will struggle for some time to develop a ""cap and trade"" program that has divided businesses and environmentalists.Such a policy would reward low-polluting companies with emissions credits that they can then sell on an open market to industries that cannot readily curb discharges.While most of the global warming regulations are subject to air board approval, some also fall under the jurisdiction of other agencies, such as the California Public Utilities Commission and the California Energy Commission.HIGHLIGHTSSome of the ways California is seeking to reduce greenhouse gases:Car fees/rebates: Fees on gas guzzlers and rebates for fuel-efficient cars.Refrigerators: Incentives to get rid of old energy wasters.Vehicles: Smoother rolling tires, and paint and windows that reflect sunlight to cut air-conditioner use and increase mileage. Reduce oil leaks and develop low-friction oil.Tire pressure: Service stations would have to properly inflate tires when customers come in for a smog check or oil change, a move that would increase mileage.Water: Expand recycling and charge fees to encourage conservation, offsetting some of the energy costs of delivering water.Cleaner fuels: Reduce the carbon content of fuels, on average, by 10 percent to cut fossil fuel use by 20 percent by 2020.Ships: Restrictions on types of fuel, energy used at the docks and lower speed limits on the water.Solar energy: More solar heating and cooling systems in homes and businesses.Forests: Protect forests because trees trap carbon dioxide, a key greenhouse gas, storing the carbon and releasing oxygen.Commercial recycling: Require businesses to increase recycling materials that cost energy to produce.Online: Union-Tribune politics writer John Marelius will take your questions and comments on national and state politics during a live online chat from 10 to 11 a.m. tomorrow at uniontrib.com/chat.",0,,,
47,4PYP-X0J0-TWDC-M08W-00000-00.txt,"While waiting for the Otay Ranch Town Center mall to open last year, Chula Vista officials were as giddy as schoolgirls waiting for, like, a mall to open.City leaders figured the new shopping center in the eastern part of the city not only would serve a growing population longing for nearby stores and restaurants but also provide a big boost in sales tax revenue -- a category in which Chula Vista has lagged historically.""The excitement is palpable,"" Chula Vista spokeswoman Liz Purcell said in the weeks leading up to the mall's opening last October.Sales tax revenue for the city came in at an estimated $500,000 for the ""lifestyle center's"" first eight months -- less than one-third of the $1.8 million city officials had projected for that time period.Blame is being directed at overblown city projections, a dampening of mall sales because of the delayed opening of a toll road adjacent to Otay Ranch Town Center and the continuing housing slowdown.The sales tax shortfall from the mall was a significant part of a big budget hole -- between $7.5 million and $9 million -- that confronted the city when it closed out the books for its fiscal year that ended June 30.""We were overly optimistic, that is obvious,"" said Chula Vista director of finance Maria Kachadorian.Kachadorian said the sales tax projections were done with the help of consultants. Going forward, the city's sales tax projections are more conservative -- an increase of 3.5 percent to 5 percent annually over the next couple of years, Kachadorian said.Tim Colby, the mall's general manager, described the center as a ""big plane to get off the ground,"" but he said things are going in the right direction.""I don't know how the city projected sales tax revenue,"" Colby said. ""(But) retail has had a less-than-stellar year nationally. I think that is the best response that I can give.""The city captures 1 percent of the 7.75 percent sales tax charged at the mall, which is the same rate as elsewhere in the county. This would peg the shopping center's sales at an estimated $50 million for its first eight months. Mall officials would not release sales information.Colby said the opening of a 12-screen AMC Theatres multiplex later this year, plus the addition of two new retailers that he would not name, would generate more foot traffic going into the holiday season.Kachadorian and other city officials place much of the blame for the disappointing sales receipts on the housing bust, which has hit Chula Vista especially hard.City and mall officials also say Otay Ranch Town Center was hurt by the delayed opening of state Route 125, the toll road that cuts through south San Diego County and is but a stone's throw from the mall.""A year ago people had no idea we'd be in such a predicament,"" said Chula Vista Mayor Cheryl Cox.Retail experts say that while predicting economic cycles might be difficult, it is not uncommon for a mall to take awhile to catch on with the community.""I wouldn't expect it to go gangbusters,"" said George Whalin, president of San Marcos-based Retail Management Consultants. ""Lifestyle malls take time to build an audience.""Otay Ranch Town Center, which opened Oct. 27, 2006, is defined as a lifestyle center because it is open-air, landscaped and targets nearby affluent neighborhoods. According to center leasing information, the average household income is $72,352 within a seven-mile radius of Otay Ranch Town Center.Shoppers and store owners give the mall mixed reviews for its first year. People seem to like the center's amenities, such as its dog park and its ""Main Street"" configuration, which allows cars to drive past or park in front of many stores.Some shoppers complain about high prices and a lack of big-name retailers compared with established area malls such as San Diego's Fashion Valley and Westfield UTC.""I don't think it's touched base with the right demographic yet,"" said Eastlake resident John Borja, 25, who was at the mall with his girlfriend on a recent Saturday afternoon. ""You know, we don't come here to buy designer jeans.""Restaurants such as The Cheesecake Factory and P.F. Chang's China Bistro, as well as popular chain stores such as Barnes &amp; Noble and the Apple Store, often teem with customers.Some of the mall's smaller tenants say the first year has been a struggle.""It's been terrible,"" said Christine DeJesus, assistant manager of the Living Room Coffee House, located on the west side of the mall. ""It started with Christmas not being nearly what we thought it would be, and then business just plummeted.""Alex Moore, a manager at the women's specialty clothing store Anthropologie, said business has been steady, if not spectacular. Moore agreed that the mall got off to a slow start but said things have improved significantly in recent months.""We've really come far from where we started,"" Moore said.Kachadorian, the city's finance director, suggests that mall sales have been harmed by the lack of another anchor department store tenant beyond Macy's. Kachadorian said she has talked to several residents who say they like Otay Ranch Town Center but still shop at Fashion Valley, which counts Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Bloomingdale's among its department stores.Colby, like the city officials, said another factor has been the more than one-year delay in the opening of Route 125, the 12 1/2 -mile toll road from Route 54 in Spring Valley to state Route 905 near the U.S.-Mexico border. The mall will be visible from the road, which is expected to provide a faster, less-congested route for mall visitors from East and North County.Mall developer General Growth Properties originally had sought to time the center's debut to the opening of the toll road one year ago. But it was not to be.The opening of the South Bay Expressway is now slated for Nov. 19.""I think it would have definitely helped if the expressway had opened on time,"" Colby said. ""People have shopping patterns, and we have to get on their map.""Whalin and other experts say the stalled housing market and corresponding slowdown in retail spending growth has been a more important factor than the toll road.The continuing stagnation in the San Diego housing market -- now mirrored nationwide -- has left homeowners with less home equity to cash out in refinancing or a home sale, meaning less money for new electronics, clothes or other discretionary purchases.Last month, the median value of a San Diego house was $470,000, down 3.1 percent from a year ago. Foreclosures have shot up 247 percent in San Diego County over the past year.Chula Vista has been hit especially hard, with city ZIP codes consistently ranked among the highest foreclosure rates in the county, said DataQuick analyst Andrew LePage.Other San Diego County cities also saw either declines or modest increases in mall sales tax revenue in the past year.Westfield North County in Escondido and Westfield Plaza Camino Real in Carlsbad both generated $200,000 less in sales tax revenue in 2006-07 than in the previous year, said officials from those cities.The combined sales tax revenue from San Diego's big malls -- Fashion Valley, Horton Plaza and UTC -- increased by $117,000, according to city of San Diego data.""Right now we are still in an adjustment phase, and it is hurting any type of retail,"" said Michael Niemira, chief economist for the International Council of Shopping Centers in New York.In August, the council reported that 62 retail chains nationwide announced more than 3,000 store closings in the first half of 2007, an increase of 12 percent from one year ago.While several stores have closed this year at Otay Ranch Town Center -- including Forth &amp; Towne, Paiva and the Discovery Channel Store -- they were the result of corporate restructurings or bankruptcies at the national level, Whalin said.U.S. retail sales posted a stronger-than-expected gain of 0.6 percent in September, but a big test for merchants, including those at Otay Ranch Town Center, will be the holiday season.The National Retail Federation, a trade association for retailers, is predicting that November-December sales will rise 4 percent. That would be the smallest increase since a 1.3 percent rise in 2002 and lower than the 10-year average of 4.8 percent.Said Whalin: ""I am more nervous about the holiday season as I've been in 20 years.""David Washburn: (619) 542-4582; david.washburn@uniontrib.comOTAY RANCH TOWN CENTEROpened: Oct. 27, 2006Where: Olympic and Eastlake parkways in Chula VistaSize: 850,000 square feet; 590,000 square feet of leasable areaAnchor stores: Macy's, REI and Barnes &amp; NobleOther retailers: 75Restaurants &amp; eateries: 24Coming soon: AMC Theatres, Guess?, Frida Mexican Cuisine, Nico's Steak &amp; Chop House.Revenue: Estimated $50 million in sales for its first eight months, based on the city's take of 1 percent in sales taxSOURCE: Union-Tribune research",1,,,"not so sure, but it is about prediting economy"
48,4SJX-R4W0-TWDC-M0RX-00000-00.txt,"After months of grim reports of slumping sales and free-falling prices, San Diego County's housing market showed signs of life in April with sales up 33.3 percent from March and the median price back at the $400,000 level.But the statistics only looked good in comparison with the most recent past. The price rebound came after nine straight months of falling prices that brought the median to $395,000 in March -- the first time it was below $400,000 since January 2004, according to DataQuick Information Systems.While the housing market always tends to perk up in the spring, this year's March-April sales increase was the best on record. Nonetheless, it was still the second-worst April sales count -- 2,809 sales, compared to the all-time April low of 2,304 in 1995, near the end of the last real estate bust.""For the most part, this is a good, old-fashioned blue-plate special -- this is discounts spurring more home sales for the most part,"" DataQuick analyst Andrew LePage said.Prices on resale houses and condos and on new housing, including condo conversions, were all higher in April than in March. But, as with sales counts, they were far below the records set two or three years ago.For instance, the overall median was 22.7 percent below the peak of $517,500 set in November 2005.Elsewhere in Southern California, DataQuick reported a burst in sales in hard-hit Riverside County, but a 19 percent drop in the six-county region from April 2007. Median prices were down 23.8 percent regionally -- with San Diego County showing the smallest decline, down 18.4 percent over the same period.These contrasts prompted LePage and other observers to caution against any celebration that high sales volumes and rising prices are back.Lori Staehling, president of the San Diego Association of Realtors, put it this way: ""We're cautiously very optimistic. ... I think we're past the bottom.""A market uptick certainly brightened the weekend for Stephanie and Richard Jensen, agents with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in La Mesa, who sold a $650,000 house in Mount Helix in six days and found an interested buyer for a $779,000 house in rural El Cajon.""Buyers are willing to sit down and put pen to paper and write an offer,"" Stephanie Jensen said. ""We're seeing that trend grow. People are saying now's the time.""But she tempered her optimism by saying, ""I don't think the end of the gloom is here yet, because there are too many unresolved problems out there.""One is the quantity of foreclosed properties -- which made up 869 of the 2,475 resale transactions last month. Another is that there are 18,329 active listings, about 200 less than at this time in May 2007, according to the San Diego Association of Realtors on the Sandicor multiple listing service.John and Kay Anderson, the sellers of the split-level Mount Helix house, had seen their property, bought in 1982 for $128,000, soar to $800,000 before falling back in the last two years.""I know this is a poor time to be selling a house,"" said John Anderson, 68. ""This is not the peak of the market anymore ... but this is a fair price, a good deal at this price for somebody, so we'll give it a try."" He said he was surprised to attract a buyer so quickly.The Andersons are moving to a one-story house in Point Loma they bought two years ago for $1 million. ""It's held its value and is probably worth about the same as when we bought it,"" John Anderson said.Fabian and Melanie Rephseldt, the other Jensen clients, are eyeing a 4,000-square-foot house on 3 acres in rural El Cajon, listed for $779,000. They live in Dusseldorf, Germany, but want to move here and start a business.""We fell in love with the place (San Diego) and now plan on being here because it's just gorgeous,"" said Fabian, 28, who first visited as an international business management student last fall.He said comparable prices in Germany would be at least double the El Cajon price, and the couple are planning to keep three properties they own back home.Alan Gin, a University of San Diego economist, and Peter Dennehy, senior vice president of Sullivan Group Real Estate Advisors, welcomed the improved housing figures. But they said one month does not necessarily signal a trend.""I think this is a good sign,"" Gin said. ""You need a couple more months of positive continued activity before you could declare it a trend.""He predicted ""continued weakness"" for the rest of the year but recommended anyone interested in buying should act in the second half of the year because interest rates might rise.Dennehy, who met with several builder clients yesterday, said plans for new housing have largely been put on hold pending a firming up of the resale market.""There are buyers out there, and they're starting to respond to better deals,"" he said. ""There is still a long way to go, but this is where it starts. ... Let's just see if it continues. I certainly expect it will.""One person who bided his time was Lou Ascione, dean of arts and humanities at City College in downtown San Diego. He moved here in October, having sold his home in Rancho Cucamonga, and waited for prices to fall dramatically in the downtown condo market.""They didn't really drop,"" he said, but the concessions on new projects improved.Tomorrow, he plans to move into the second floor of the 77-unit Solara Lofts, a former office condo project at Fourth Avenue and Cedar Street. He bought a 1,134-square-foot unit for $404,900, but his lender is rebating 6 percent of the price, more than covering his 5 percent down payment.""That was wild,"" he said. ""I didn't believe it was correct.""The latest DataQuick figures signaled a market that, as one observer put it, is split between the relatively stable coast and still-depreciating inland.Lou Martin, an agent with Prudential California specializing in Rancho Santa Fe and coastal neighborhoods, said buying of million-dollar-plus homes is largely unaffected by the overall downturn.""A lot of people are cash buyers, bringing in a large amount of money,"" Martin said.Joanne Rust, an agent with Coldwell Banker's Mission Valley office but specializing in Chula Vista, said buyers have begun calling her to look for South Bay deals.""They feel like it's closer to getting to the bottom of the market,"" she said.

It's going to get worse.\"" Two years ago the department recommended that all wild bees be exterminated.But now beekeepers are divided - with some ignoring the call to exterminate - saying they're in the midst of the biggest crisis their profession has ever seen. Nearly 50 percent of the nation's captive bees have disappeared in the past year to a mysterious syndrome.\""It's a double-edged sword,\"" said Dade City beekeeper David Hackenberg. \""I understand why you would be concerned about public safety. Unfortunately, we need these bees.\""Jeff McChesney, a Gulfport pest exterminator and bee enthusiast, has helped place a dozen wild bee hives with beekeepers struggling to rebuild their devastated colonies. \""I have people from as far as the state of Oregon who are willing to drive here once a month to get our bees because they are collapsing elsewhere,\"" he said.But last month the state warned him about the risks. \""I'm kind of at a standstill now,\"" he said. \""I don't know if we should kill them or save the bees.\""Accidental releaseAfricanized bees, a crossbreed of honey bees from Europe and southern Africa, were introduced to the Western Hemisphere in 1957 when they were accidentally released during an attempt to create a super-productive breed.Over time, shipping traffic brought the bees to the United States via various ports. In Tampa Bay, the bees were first reported in 2002. Since then, they have kept multiplying at a continuous rate, Hayes said.In a 2005 statewide sample study of wild bees, 60 percent were Africanized bees. This year, that number was 87 percent.The bees are so dominant in part because they can recruit more gentle bees. They also attack European beehives, killing the queen and installing their own. And their queens produce offspring more quickly.Africanized bees, which appear similar to European bees, attack in far greater numbers and will chase their victims. In the most recent bee-related death, a Texas man was killed in September after more than 1,000 bees attacked him.No Africanized bee-related fatalities have been reported in Florida, but several people have been hospitalized after attacks. And one of the more brutal animal deaths involved a 900-pound horse in Hendry County that died in 2005 when more than a thousand Africanized bees attacked it. Four pounds of bees were found in the horse's stomach.\""This is the kind of thing that keeps me awake at 2 a.m.,\"" Hayes said. \""They will sting hundreds or thousands of times. They will go up your nose and in your mouth. We are talking about a real dramatic death and we just don't need that in Florida.\""Collapse of coloniesThe growth of the killer bees comes at a time when captive bees nationwide are disappearing in an unexplained phenomenon named Colony Collapse Disorder. Experts who might have once advocated bringing in wild bees to supplement the loss of the managed colonies say doing so now would be too risky.\""As long as we have beekeepers, we will have good bees; the problem is the bees in the wild, you can't tell what kind of bees they are,\"" said Elmore Herman, a Marianna beekeeper and president of the Florida State Beekeepers Association. \""So why take the chance of taking them home and getting someone stung?\""But some beekeepers say state officials should at least try to distinguish between European or Africanized wild bees instead of writing them all off.\""This is how we get fruit and other crops,\"" said Hackenberg, the Dade City beekeeper who first sounded the alarm about Colony Collapse Disorder last fall when thousands of his bees disappeared. \""We need everything we've got to pollinate whatever there is out there.\""Later this month, beekeepers are set to discuss Africanized bees at their annual state conference in Winter Haven. (The state has about 1,000 beekeepers.)However, some rogue bee advocates, convinced agriculture officials are overreacting to reports of bee attacks in other areas, already have begun domesticating Africanized bees, introducing them into colonies run by European bee queens.It's unclear if the effort will work. Africanized bees spend more time foraging for pollen, which could make them better pollinators than their European brethren, but they also produce less honey for the same reason.In Brazil, farmers have used Africanized bees to pollinate crops, but it is still experimental in the United States and state officials do not recommend it.Some bee advocates say if wild bees do not exhibit aggression they should not be exterminated.Jimmy McKinnon, an amateur beekeeper in St. Petersburg, has wild bees, although he doesn't believe any are Africanized.\""Just to go across the board and kill all the bees, it is the stupidest thing I have ever heard,\"" McKinnon said.No data on harvestFarming officials say they don't know what the ultimate impact of the captive bee die-out will be or even what could happen if Africanized bees keep spreading across the state. So far, neither situation has meant less honey or a loss in food crops.But no data has been collected to compare the number of bees with the pounds of food collected each harvest season, said Charles Moss, a food and resource economics professor at the University of Florida. He was recently tapped by the state to research the impact of Africanized bees.\""We won't know what the impact will be unless it reaches a catastrophic level, and then it is too late.\""Cristina Silva can be reached at csilva@sptimes.com or (727) 893-8846.FAST FACTSAfricanized beesAfricanized bees are fiercely protective of their territories and will relentlessly attack any perceived threats.- If there is a beehive on your property, do not attempt to remove it or exterminate the bees yourself.

50,4RJ5-M4C0-TX4W-S07W-00000-00.txt,"Rising fuel costs and other economic factors are driving up the cost of food and pushing Portland school officials to consider increasing the prices of cafeteria lunches for the second year in a row.Maine's largest school district is paying higher prices for everything from pizza cheese, which has increased $26 per 30-pound case, to whole wheat flour, which is up $5.88 per 50-pound bag, said William Verrill, Portland's food service director.Similar increases are hitting school districts across the country, especially in Northeastern and Western states, according to the School Nutrition Association.To avoid overspending his $1 million food budget by as much as $100,000 this year, Verrill has proposed 25-cent and 50-cent increases in students' lunch prices.He also plans to save money by choosing foods that are tasty and meet federal nutrition standards but are less expensive to buy and prepare.''There isn't one part of my budget that isn't increasing,'' Verrill said Friday. ''I've been at this 31 years, and I've never seen across-the-board increases like this.''Interim Superintendent Jeanne Whynot-Vickers will ask the School Committee on Wednesday to increase the price of a school lunch from $1.75 for all students to $2 for students in kindergarten to grade 5 and $2.25 for students in grades 6 to 12.The increases would be 14.3 percent and 28.6 percent, respectively.The Maine Department of Education caps lunch prices at $2 for elementary schools and $2.25 for secondary schools, said David Connerty-Marin, the department's spokesman. Districts cannot exceed those prices without a waiver.Portland's price increase would boost food service revenue by $25,000, Verrill said. The increase wouldn't affect students who receive free or reduced-price meals.Lunches for adults would increase 14.3 percent, from $3.50 to $4, according to Verrill's proposal. Prices of a la carte items, available at Portland's high schools, would increase according to the prices the district pays for them.Verrill said it costs $3.27, on average, to produce each school lunch. The district, which has about 7,000 students and 1,200 employees, serves more than 3,100 lunches each day.Portland receives federal subsidies to augment its food service program: 25 cents for each paid meal; $2.09 for each reduced-price meal, which costs eligible students 40 cents; and $2.49 for every free meal.The district increased lunch prices by 25 cents last year, 25 cents in 2004, and 25 cents in 1998. Before that, Verrill said, Portland's lunch prices remained unchanged for several years at a time.School districts across Maine and the nation are facing food-service cost crunches, said Connerty-Marin at the Department of Education and Erik Peterson at the School Nutrition Association in Alexandria, Va. Districts in the Northeast and on the West Coast seem to be feeling it more than others,'' Peterson said.He noted that these regions have higher labor costs and have embraced efforts to provide low-fat, fresh and otherwise healthier foods, which are more expensive.Some school districts in Southern states charge as little as $1 for a student's lunch, Peterson said, while some school districts in California charge as much as $4.In addition to their own rising fuel and labor costs, districts are dealing with food producers and wholesalers who are passing along their rising costs. That is apparent especially with dairy product prices, which have skyrocketed in recent months.Besides paying more to process and transport their milk, dairy farmers say they are paying more for corn to feed their cows because more of the crop is being diverted to make ethanol as a gasoline alternative.Most of Portland's school lunches are prepared at a central kitchen on Homestead Avenue and trucked to the elementary and middle schools. Portland and Deering high schools have kitchens that offer regular lunches and a la carte items.Verrill said he expects his diesel fuel costs to exceed his $3,000 budget by about $500 this year.To save money, Verrill said, Portland schools now serve canned fruit more frequently than fresh fruit, which is more expensive. He's even being picky about what kind of canned fruit they serve.On Friday, for instance, Verrill swapped the planned dessert of canned peaches, which cost $28 per case, to canned pineapple tidbits, which cost $21 per case. The district served 30 cases of pineapple Friday, so Verrill saved $210.Verrill said he figures labor costs into each meal, balancing the expense of making items from scratch and buying prepared and semi-prepared items.The district buys prepared salad ingredients, for instance, because it's cheaper than paying someone to chop lettuce, cabbage and cucumbers.''But we make our own rolls and pizza crust because we can make it so much cheaper than we can buy it,'' Verrill said.John Coyne, School Committee chairman, said he's not happy that school lunch prices may go up again, but he's glad that Verrill brought the potential budget overrun to the committee's attention.He said it's the kind of financial management the district needs in order to avoid a budget crisis like last year's $2 million deficit.''The increase ... is an acceptable way to help the district make ends meet,'' Coyne said. ''Parents still have the option to make their kids a bag lunch if they think they can do it cheaper.''Staff Writer Kelley Bouchard can be contacted at 791-6328 or at:kbouchard@pressherald.com",0,,,

Each program is undergoing a review process and reports are due Tuesday, officials said.\""The tsunami that hit us was much larger than anyone could have predicted,\"" said university Provost Martin DenBoer. \""It is going to make us less of an institution, but it's necessary given the budget we find ourselves in.\""DenBoer declined to give a specific list of programs being considered. A list of programs and enrollment size is provided on the school's Web site, he said.While furloughs, layoffs and other cuts have reduced Cal Poly Pomona's academic budget drastically -- from about $90 million last year to $71 million for 2009-2010 -- the university is preparing for even less for 2010-2011 school year.Programs cuts will give full-time teachers less chances to teach specialized upper division courses.Instead they will be asked to concentrate on lower division courses needed by more students, DenBoer said.Many of the cuts will be based on what the leadership feels is the best course ofthe university rather than pure statistics, officials said.\""These are going to be, at the end of the day, qualitative judgments,\"" DenBoer said.DenBoer, who has been the provost since Aug. 2008, will put together a list of recommendations and submit those to the academic senate for approval.The list will eventually make its way to President J. Michael Ortiz for final approval.A decision on which programs will be cut is expected in the next few weeks, DenBoer said.\""It is frustrating. My program is just exactly the sort of thing the CSU should be doing ... and here we are in a position to try and defend our existence,\"" said Political Science Chair David Speak, whose Master's of Public Administration program is threatened.Departments have already been scaling back classes. In some cases, adjunct faculty members were not rehired.\""It is fair to say there is divided opinion about (how the administration is handling the budget),\"" said David Adams, chair of the Philosophy Department who had 68 students enrolled in Fall 2008, but has close to 100 now.Some of Adams' colleagues believe administrative positions at Cal Poly Pomona have grown disproportionately to faculty, he said.Others said grim options faced by the administration were brought on by the state legislature, he said.\""The essential components are the students and the teachers,\"" Adams said. \""If you are going to cut, that should be the last thing you should cut.\""While Cal Poly's undergraduate history program has more than 200 students, a graduate program is also being considered for termination.Lewis said it might be time for the university to overhaul programs, a move he said Cal Poly should probably have attempted during better times, he said.\""There isn't a whole lot of discussion amongst all of the constituencies. There is a great deal of mistrust between faculty and administration, and the students are left out,\"" Lewis said.At times, universities and professors have focused on quantitative efforts, like getting accolades from U.S. News and World Report instead of coming up with innovative ideas to graduate students, Lewis said.Sometimes it has just been a lack of productivity by the university, he said.And some demands for cuts have come from the Cal State University system's leadership.\""We are all trying to follow what (CSU Chancellor) Charles Reed has suggested. It is not entirely just the local administrators responsibility,\"" Lewis said.DenBoer agrees it is an opportunity for administration and faculty to be innovative in reshaping some academics. There are several options under consideration.One idea is to combine departments.Another is a process of sharing within the CSU system so students could Cal State schools for certain classes, DenBoer said.In the past, the system has been very traditional, but this is a chance to do something new and cost-efficient while still educating students, DenBoer said.\""It is an opportunity we have to handle very carefully to make sure we don't destroy the heart of the university,\"" he said.daniel.tedford@sgvn.com (626) 962-8811, Ext. 2730To see more of the San Gabriel Valley Tribune or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.sgvtribune.com.

52,4THB-JKS0-TX12-N0CM-00000-00.txt,"c(""Sep. 21--With heating costs up and government assistance down, some Schuylkill County residents simply don't know how they will heat their homes this winter.\""I never thought I'd have to go looking for help,\"" Rosalie Fetterolf, Ashland, said Friday.Fetterolf, a senior citizen who has been living on Social Security since her husband's death more than a year and a half ago, turned to the Salvation Army for heating assistance for the first time last year.She received a 100-gallon delivery for her new kerosene furnace in early June, and is counting on more help going into winter.\""If I don't get fuel assistance, I will just have to pay my fuel bills and not pay something else,\"" Fetterolf said. \""Robbing Peter to pay Paul.\""Receiving less or no fuel assistance is a real possibility for many, as heating assistance programs are tightening their belts around Schuylkill County and the rest of the state.The 2008 budget for the Emergency Food and Shelter National Board Program, which funds many county agencies, is $47,218 -- $40,000 less than the 2007 budget, and down almost $29,000 from the previous all-time low in 1996.Funding for the federal Low Income Heating and Home Energy Assistance Program, which the state Department of Public Works administers in the state, is also down about $50 million from last year, Department Press Secretary Stacey Witalec said.With reduced funding, Schuylkill Community Action Executive Director Ted Dreisbach said he's afraid that those seeking assistance might be helplessly shuffled around.\""I'd hate to see a situation where I send someone from Schuylkill Community Action to the Salvation Army, and then have them sent to the Department of Public Welfare,\"" Dreisbach said.Patricia Margie, Pottsville, said that's just what's been happening to her as she tries to get ready for the winter. Margie said she hasn't received heating oil since she got the minimum delivery of 75 gallons through LIHEAP in February.Income is also down at her business, Crabby Patty's Cleaners, 1588 W. Market St. Since she opened in 1998, Margie said she usually made enough money between September and December to pay rent and insurance for the first half of the next year.However, in the past year, dry cleaning has become more of a luxury under a struggling economy. Margie has lost a full-time employee and runs the store herself.On a typical Friday a year ago, there would be piles of clothes on the floor with tags on them, Margie said. During an interview on Friday afternoon, Margie pointed to one pile on the floor, the day's only order. To make ends meet, Margie has picked up two part-time jobs with cleaning services.\""I just bought a house in September,\"" Margie said. \""Who would have thought the economy would have gotten this bad?\""Local organizations are also looking for ways to aid residents while facing cutbacks themselves. Schuylkill Community Action, for example, lost more than $10,000 in funds this year, and decided to focus on higher priority programs, such as serving the homeless, instead of helping with heating bills.The group's utility assistance program would have granted those living at or below 175 percent of the federal poverty guidelines one delivery of $150 for oil, although that amount means less and less with current high heating price hikes.\""That's not even a load of oil anymore,\"" Dreisbach said.Dreisbach said he didn't have precise numbers for how many people had sought heating assistance, but he's observed more calls than in previous years, and earlier in the year.Pennsylvania has received a block grant of about $142 million in LIHEAP funds for the 2008-09 winter season, Witalec said in an interview Tuesday. Typically, another allocation of money may be released around January.Last year, the state was lucky to receive $44 million in emergency contingency funds from the federal government, as well as an extra $6 million in March, to bring the 2007-08 total to $200 million, but Witalec isn't counting on a repeat performance under today's tough economic conditions.\""There is absolutely no guarantee that we will get that money,\"" Witalec said. \""This year, we're at $142.4 million, so we have significantly less in the bank to spend on the program given the fact that energy costs are still continuing to rise. People are still trying to rebound from the ***economic downturn**.\""The Bush administration announced Wednesday it would release additional home heating funds, more than $6.5 million of which is expected to go to Pennsylvania, but that's still a long way off last year's mark.The Department of Public Welfare is trying to more tightly manage its limited funds by focusing on conservation measures like putting money into home weatherization efforts, increasing energy efficiency and everyday tips like turning down the thermostat or piling on sweaters and slippers.Schuylkill Community Action has received some LIHEAP funds for its own weatherization program, although Dreisbach said the waiting list is already at four to five months.Cost-cutting measures are already a part of Fetterolf's lifestyle. Fetterolf said she keeps the thermostat down, and is used to jarring her own food because of her late husband's dietary needs.Margie said she applied for weatherization help through Schuylkill Community Action, and had work done two months ago after a six-month wait.Lately, Margie has been buying kerosene from Sheetz at $5 a gallon to heat the water in her showers. It's more expensive than heating oil, but she can't afford the minimum shipment.Like Fetterolf, Margie, a previous LIHEAP recipient who has had no income change, is hoping this year's assistance carries her through. And, like Fetterolf, she has few alternate ideas.\""I'm already at drastic measures now,\"" Margie said.To see more of the Republican &amp; Herald or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.republicanherald.com.

Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.Gov. John Hoeven and Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., along with officials from the major cities in the state, also attended the meeting.While the frequency of the flights and type of aircraft flown from the cities was not disclosed, Bastion said the expanded service will allow travelers to connect with 27 other Delta destinations.The merger, which was announced in October, will not be finalized for a year or more, Bastion said.Delta once had a presence in the state, and Bastian said with Northwest's history of air service to North Dakota, there will be a renewed commitment to providing reliable flights in the future.Hoeven said among his questions were what kind of a commitment Delta would have to serving the state.""That's what we're here for,""he said, ""to hear a commitment from the top people at Delta.""We will continue to press Delta to ensure that they not only maintain, but enhance services for North Dakota consumers and businesses,"" Hoeven said.As far as the frequency of the daily flights and the types of aircraft, Bastian said it's something the airline will look at.He said the number of flights west out of Bismarck and Fargo likely will be based on demand, with fewer coming Tuesdays and Wednesdays and more on the heavily travel days like Friday and Saturday.""It's hard to meter demand,"" Bastian said.The types of airplanes, he said, will likely be Delta 76-seat regional jets with Delta crews.Bastian said flyers will have ""the same experience"" as with larger jets, with the exception of perhaps cargo space.Airfares also were something not laid out at Thursday's meeting.Fargo officials expressed some concern that if Delta were not competitive in its price structure, travelers would opt to make the four-hour drive to the Twin Cities rather that flying out of North Dakota airports.Bismarck Mayor John Warford said that was among his concerns as the merger unfolded.He said his primary concern was that Bismarck would maintain its connection with Minneapolis-St. Paul, and that the change in the fleet would result in diminished service.""The RJs (regional jets) are jets and that's good,"" he said.But he said the 50-passenger models may compromise comfort and cargo space.That, Warford said, and prices. ""I would like to see a level playing field, but I don't think they answered that question.""Bastian said Delta maintains a $6 billion cash position in the marketplace, which will give them the ""financial muscle"" to remain competitive over the long haul.He said that with the nation in a ***recession**, the airline industry is not immune to ""shrinkage,"" but the merger makes them the world's largest airline.Currently the state's air travel patterns average 47 daily flights out of eight airports, accounting for just under 3,000 seats.Fargo has an average of 16 daily flights with 1,275 seats; Bismarck has eight flights with about 639 seats on a daily average.According to North Dakota Aeronautics Commission numbers, North Dakota air travelers have increased passenger revenue for Northwest Airlines33 percent since 2003.But the data also showed that Northwest, the state's largest carrier, has been losing market share in the past decade, down from of high of 88 percent in 1997 to 63 percent this year.With North Dakota, at least for now, seemingly insulated from the national ***economic downturn**, leaders say the news is positive for future economic growth.""Reliable air service is essential to trade, travel and tourism in North Dakota,""Pomeroy said.Dorgan echoed that, saying he envisions the state ""being one stop from anywhere and one stop from everywhere.""(Reach reporter Brian Gehring at 250-8254 or brian.gehring@bismarcktribune.com.)Bismarck, Fargo to get daily air service west",0,,,
54,4VBJ-CT90-TX7B-K0D1-00000-00.txt,"Even as they grapple over the details of an economic stimulus bill, Democrats are emphasizing just how much they share President-elect Barack Obama's broad goals and accept his general outline for the legislation. The chorus of agreement comes after days of growing -- and, for Democrats, uncomfortably public -- intraparty skirmishing about the mix of taxes and spending in the incoming administration's proposal, and it signals that Democrats will try to close ranks and settle on a plan as they head toward committee markups the week of Jan. 19.""It's certainly true that we in Congress will have input,"" Sen. Charles E. Schumer,D-N.Y., said in a Jan. 9 conference call. But, he added, ""The urgency of this ***economic crisis** . . . is going to limit any haggling over competing approaches."" Schumer predicted that Congress would complete its work by a self-imposed Feb. 13 deadline and would enact a package greater than the $775 billion suggested by the Obama administration but still less than $1 trillion.""The centerpiece of the Obama tax relief package is the middle class tax relief, and we have broad agreement on that,"" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., a member of the Ways and Means Committee and the House leadership.The largest tax piece of the stimulus bill is expected to be a new refundable income tax credit that would effectively lower payroll taxes by $500 per worker. The money would be distributed through changes to paycheck withholding, meaning that there will not be another round of rebate checks, as there were last year (PL 110-185). But the idea of handing money to consumers isn't universally popular, particularly in the Senate. And significant disagreements remain as the administration tries to craft a proposal that can satisfy Republicans who want tax cuts and Democrats who want more spending on infrastructure and renewable energy. Obama acknowledged that lawmakers and administration officials will continue to ""hone and refine"" the proposal, even as they press for quick action. ""There are going to be a whole host of good ideas out there, and we welcome all of them,"" he said Jan. 9. ""And we're going to sift through all of them, and we are going to work in a collaborative fashion with Congress.""Talks ContinueObama's economic advisers, including former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, met with Ways and Means Democrats on Jan. 9 to try to work through any disputes on the tax package. ""He made a presentation, indicated some flexibility. We raised some questions, indicated some flexibility. And that's kind of where it was,"" said Richard E. Neal, D-Mass., a Ways and Means member. They will resume those discussions Tuesday afternoon.In particular, an Obama proposal to offer a $3,000-per-job tax credit for businesses that hire new workers has come under attack from Democrats, who argue that it would be difficult to measure job creation and wonder if it would actually encourage businesses to change their behavior. Neal said the idea is ""not getting traction.""But Obama has promoted it, and the provision does have supporters in Congress. Reps. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, and Pat Tiberi, R-Ohio, both said they thought the credit would be particularly attractive to small businesses.Ways and Means Chairman Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., signaled that if the incoming administration insists on some of the less popular proposals, it would have to provide more justification for them. ""We did make it clear that where [Summers] thought that the part of the proposals made a lot of economic sense, he was going to have to help us in some kind of way to think of ways to interpret this for political reasons, because we are the salespeople for the president and this package,"" Rangel said.He also said that someone would have to explain how it could be fair that companies that received money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (PL 110-343) could also be eligible for the business tax cuts in the stimulus bill.Rangel added that he feels ""a little uneasy"" that lawmakers will have to make decisions so quickly on such a big bill that will need to satisfy senators, who usually insist on more deliberation. ""We have broad latitude to negotiate,"" he said. ""Our problem is that time is not our friend, that this damn thing is moving so fast and they have so many different pieces to put together.""Ideas Keep ComingMeanwhile, more details continued to emerge about various pieces of the proposal. Ways and Means members are discussing whether to include a ""patch"" that would prevent the alternative minimum tax from hitting more families in 2009.The bill is also expected to include money for communities to buy foreclosed homes, said Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank, D-Mass. Democrats made similar efforts last year, but dropped those proposals from broader housing legislation before enactment (PL 110-289). The stimulus package seems likely to remain in flux throughout the next week as negotiations continue. Veteran lawmaker John M. Spratt Jr., D-S.C., shrugged off the early struggles, calling them part of the normal process.""You just don't bring a bill of this kind cold to the caucus or to the Congress and to the floor,"" said Spratt, chairman of the House Budget Committee. ""There will be a lot of shopping of different provisions. They test-marketed an idea; they'll go back downtown and say: 'This works, this doesn't.' We did it all the time in 1997.""  Joseph J.

In the face of rising fuel prices they simply sat on their hands too long before retooling for smaller vehicles. Shame on them.However, an ample supply of high quality, high mileage vehicles is only one of the two issues facing the Big Three. They still need to sell their products at a profit. This they cannot do. The culprit is the UAW. It has failed to come to grips with the fact that competition from overseas manufacturers has rendered their contracts unsustainable by U.S. automakers. The times are not just changing, they've already changed. The UAW just hasn't come to grips with it. Either it will or it -- along with Ford, GM and Chrysler-- will cease to exist.Speaking of other houses of cards about to tumble for similar reasons, one doesn't have to look beyond the city of San Diego or the state of California to see culprits of the same ilk. Lunches aren't free out here, either.TIM DiMASI San DiegoAs a U.S. naval pilot during World War II, I flew B-24 Liberators manufactured by the Ford Motor Co. in Willow Run, Mich. (Have critics forgotten the critical role automotive companies played in our World War II ""Arsenal of Democracy""?) I went on to work for Ford for 32 years. As the concept planner for the highly successful Fiesta small car (more than 3 million sold in Europe since 1977, and about to be reintroduced), I know American auto companies are better than competitive when it's a fair fight.And as a former operating executive for Ford in Asia, I am all too familiar with how those countries legislated rules that forced our Big Three automakers to actually manufacture -- not merely assemble -- cars in their countries, unlike the United States where trade policies continue to hand our Asian competitors massive advantages in cost-per-vehicle. Toyota's Prius, for example, is built entirely in Japan and exported here, ready for sale. Can we please look at these facts before we lay all the blame for the current crisis on auto CEOs? We might find that U.S. government policies (lack of a viable energy policy and fair-trade laws), the almost insatiable public demand -- until $4 gas -- for SUVs and F-150 trucks and the rejection of tighter fuel economy standards are also at fault.The U.S. automotive industry is not only a national defense treasure, but accounts for millions of jobs, billions of GNP dollars and should be saved.RALPH L. PETERS Rancho Santa FeRegarding ""A bailout for automakers? Yes/But with plenty of tough love for Detroit"" (Opinion, Nov. 18):San Diego State University finance professor Daniel Seiver would do well to read his own commentary before coming down in favor of a bailout for the Big Three automakers. Seiver readily acknowledges that labor costs ""put The Big Three at a huge disadvantage relative to America's other big-car companies: Honda, Toyota and Nissan."" ""Only in Chapter 11 bankruptcy,"" Seiver correctly maintains, ""would the Big Three be able to restructure their costs, and their entire companies, to become lean and mean enough to compete successfully in the 21st century."" This is the crux of the reason for rejecting any public bailout, not supporting it.The bailout being pushed by congressional Democrats would serve one purpose only, to temporarily maintain the contract terms of the UAW and other ancillary unions who have overwhelmingly supported Democratic candidates. Such ""altruism"" toward union members, though, would be extremely short-sighted. Unless the Big Three are able to go back to square one in terms of how they function and how much they compensate their workers, the bailout can only serve to postpone the inevitable and make it that much more difficult to resurrect these dying companies. Throwing taxpayer money into the morass that is the Big Three at this point would be nothing short of criminal.MICHAEL WARREN EncinitasGeneral Motors (and the others, as necessary) should be allowed to go out of business. They put themselves into this predicament. The average Big Three worker pay rate (including benefits) is $72 per hour. If they go bankrupt, they will be able to renegotiate the union contracts and cut out this absurdly high pay scale. Japanese automakers manufacturing in the United States pay their workers (including benefits) an average of $47 per hour. Ever wonder why the Japanese cars are so much a better value for the money? The biggest backers of a Big Three bailout are the unions. The handwriting is on the wall. Let 'em read it!RICHARD KORTS Escondido",1,,,

57,7X9N-J6G1-2PWG-B4FC-00000-00.txt,"It's often been said, ""Oh, if I could only print money!"" But that's just what Pittsburgh-born Pop artist Andy Warhol did way back in 1962 when he created ""200 One Dollar Bills."" Just last month, the screen-printed artwork sold at auction for a whopping $43.8 million, more than three times its high presale estimate of $12 million. That's a lot more greenbacks than it took to make the piece, but believe it or not, it's not the highest price paid for the artist's work. The highest auction record for a Warhol is $71.7 million for ""Green Car Crash,"" which sold at Christie's in 2007. And just two weeks ago, the Economist reported that Warhol's ""Eight Elvises"" painting (1963) was purchased privately for even more than that. According to the Nov. 26 article, the painting's sale was brokered in August 2008 by French art dealer Philippe Segalot between an anonymous buyer and seller for $100 million. It's at least worth knowing the 12-foot canvas of a gun-toting Elvis in cowboy gear is unique -- there is only one, which is rather rare for an artist who was no stranger to mass production. Both the news of that and last month's sale at Sotheby's sent rumblings through the art world. As well it should. Warhol's oeuvre has consistently been an indicator of the state of the art market, ever since his untimely death on Feb. 22, 1987, because of heart failure hours after undergoing gallbladder surgery. Warhol created more than 10,000 artworks, starting in the early 1960s. They are everywhere, in nearly every major museum's collection the world over, as well as countless private collections, and at least a few come up for bid at auction every spring and fall. These particular sales sparked a memory for me. The year after Warhol's death, I took my first trip to Manhattan. I walked into a small Greenwich Village gallery filled with about eight large Warhol works on paper. I remember the young art dealer, not much older than myself, telling me, ""If you buy one of these now, I can guarantee it will be worth it. In a few years, you'll double your money.""  ""$10,000, are you crazy! I could buy a car for that,"" I quipped. And I desperately needed a car then. So what would it be worth today, had I bought it? I've often thought about that as I've watched the prices for Warhol's works rise and fall over the years. As a certified fine art appraiser, I am well aware now. Let's just put it this way, I could have sold it and bought a house. And at this point, I need one of those, too. Even though Warhol's death coincided with the pre-1990s boom in the art market, sales have dipped on occasion, especially in 1990, when sales of contemporary art dropped dramatically across the board. Again in 1993, at a spring Sotheby's sale, 10 of the 12 Warhols consigned by Fred Hughes, Warhol's longtime friend, business manager and executor of his estate, failed to meet estimates. But since then, there have been steady gains, even recently, in spite of the ***recession**. That's a long way from what a work by Warhol sold for in 1962, the same year he created ""200 One Dollar Bills."" Back then, Los Angeles art dealer Irving Blum gave Warhol his first solo exhibit. Warhol presented 32 paintings, some for sale as low as $30 each. He didn't sell a single one during the run of the show, so Blum bought them all from the artist for $1,000. Over the years, Blum has sold many of them, and some have reached incredible prices at auction in their own right. For example, ""Small Torn Campbell's Soup Can (Pepper Pot),"" handpainted by Warhol in 1962, sold for $11.7 million at Christie's in the spring of 2006. In that same sale, ""S&amp;H Green Stamps,"" also painted in 1962, sold for $5.1 million. And there have been many more similar stories since. In fact, the seller of ""200 One Dollar Bills"" bought it in 1986 for $385,000. With more than a $43 million profit, that's proof that Warhol did more than print money. His work is better than gold.

Individual companies range in size from less than $10 million in market value to $140 billion or more.Indeed, a dozen corporations headquartered in Georgia were big enough to find a place on this year's Fortune 500 list, a benchmark of business size and success. Fortune ranks companies by annual revenue, with the latest list based on 2007 results.Among them are home-improvement retailer Home Depot at Georgia's highest rank (22nd). UPS, a global package-delivery company, was 46th, and possibly the best-known corporate moniker on the globe, beverage giant Coca-Cola, was in 83rd place.But ""big"" does not accurately describe the universe of publicly traded companies headquartered in Georgia. Most are ""midcaps"" or ""small caps."" That's Wall Street jargon for "" mid- or smaller-capitalized"" companies, or size based on market value --- share price times the number of shares outstanding.There is no official definition of ""small,"" but some analysts put it at anything less than $700 million; others put the cutoff at $500 million.Small vs. largeIn Georgia, two-thirds of the publicly traded companies have market caps of under $500 million. But among them are well-known names, such as Georgia Gulf, CryoLife, Haverty Furniture, Oxford Industries and Spectrum Brands.Not to be overlooked, roughly a third of Georgia's public companies have market caps of less than $100 million, which some analysts regard as ""microcap.""For investors, small vs. large is a point to take seriously. According to money managers, the stocks of smaller companies have historically outperformed big-cap stocks in periods of economic expansion. That has certainly been true of most years since the last Wall Street bear market that ended in 2002.But the tables turned in 2007, when small-cap stocks took a hit in total return because of the impact of the mortgage and credit crisis on banks and real estate-related companies.The damage to Georgia's ""backyard"" was mitigated, however, by another characteristic of the state's public sector: As a group, the companies are highly diverse. No single industry dominates the state or its public companies, which economists cite as a major reason for Georgia's better-than-average growth over the years.About 22 percent of the public companies in Georgia are banks or otherwise engaged in a financial service. By far the largest number in this sector are local, or community, banks scattered throughout the state. The two largest are regional financial institutions: SunTrust Banks in Atlanta and Synovus Financial in Columbus, both in the Fortune 500 and always in the Georgia 100.If insurance is included under the finance heading, the list would include companies such as Aflac, Atlantic American and Crawford &amp; Co., the latter being the world's largest independent insurance adjuster.The broad consumer market is served by about 22 percent of the publicly traded firms --- companies that make products or provide consumer services. Companies that supply services or products chiefly to other businesses account for an additional 19 percent of the total.About 14 percent of the companies are in technology and an additional 9 percent in health care, while a surprising 14 percent are industrials, or manufacturers, of one kind or another.A big percentage of Georgia's public companies operate globally, through foreign operations, trade or services. Coca-Cola, Delta Air Lines and UPS are among the giants in this sector, but many smaller companies also make money overseas.Invesco now officialOne global company, Invesco Ltd., a leading investment advisory firm with a $10.2 billion market value, has long been an Atlanta business. But it did not officially become Atlanta-based until 2007, when it relocated its headquarters from London.That also made it eligible for the first time to be included in the Georgia 100, where it is No. 15.Anotheuyr example of global diversity is IntercontinentalExchange, a $9.4 billion market-cap Atlanta company that operates a worldwide Internet commodity exchange market, with major operations in New York and London.It's not surprising that Georgia is home to a relatively large number of public companies, given the state's central place in the Sun Belt.Georgia was a recipient of the historic migration of people, business and industry from North to South in the post-World War II era, known as the Sun Belt phenomenon. This migration gained momentum in the 1960s and accelerated in subsequent decades.Georgia is by no means the only state that experienced this growth, of course. While it is home to 12 Fortune 500 companies on the latest list, Florida and North Carolina have 14 each.That's a reflection of how much the Southeast's growth has evened out over time, thanks to more competitive industrial and business development programs --- and state-sponsored financial incentives --- in all the states in the region.Go to ajc.com/georgia-100 for these online exclusives:* Compare and re-sort how the companies rank in five separate financial benchmarks.* Individual company profiles, including clickable links to each company's Web site.* Clickable ticker symbols for updated market data and charts you can customize.",0,,,
59,4SDP-4RB0-TXDB-40J4-00000-00.txt,"After four years of 9% GDP growth, and boasts of overtaking China, Indians are reluctant to believe that the economy is headed for a serious fall. But the stock market has crashed, an indication of the pain ahead.Western observers have lavished praise on India as a rising economic superpower, so many Indians believe we have achieved 9% growth simply because we are so clever and resourceful. This is a delusion of grandeur. In fact, a global tide has lifted the whole world economy -- India along with all others. Now that the global tide is ebbing, India will fall with all others. Given our strengths, we will not suffer as badly as some others. But suffer we will.After more than a decade of 6% growth, India accelerated to almost 9% in the last four years. But sub-Saharan Africa also accelerated, from 2.4% per year in the 1990s to almost 5.8 % in the last four years, a stronger acceleration than in India! Azerbaijan grew by a whopping 31% in 2006 and maybe 27% in 2007. Turkmenistan grew by 18% in 2006.Sudan is enduring a civil war and genocide in Darfur, but even its latest growth rate is a staggering 12%. Rwanda, site of the genocide made famous most recently by the film Hotel Rwanda, is enjoying 8.5% growth. Liberia, site of the Hollywood hit Blood Diamond, is growing at 9%.So India's 9% growth in the last four years is hardly exceptional.THE CORE CAUSE of India's boom was huge overspending by Americans in the last decade, based on a long housing boom. Americans borrowed ever more billions against their rising property values, and went on a spending spree that greatly exceeded their disposable incomes. Overspending led to a record U.S. trade deficit of $700 billion per year.The mirror image of this was rising trade surpluses -- and hence, foreign exchange reserves -- in other countries. These for-ex surpluses were in turn used to buy U.S. securities, depressing U.S. interest rates and making borrowing even more attractive. Americans borrowed still more, spent still more, and imported still more.This created a huge consumption-based growth cycle across the globe. The U.S. consumer splurge was especially helpful to China, the most competitive exporter of manufactures, which grew rapidly through an export boom. India, which exported competitive services, also benefited. Other Asian countries, from Vietnam to Pakistan, also began growing at rapid rates.But these Asian countries needed to import huge quantities of commodities, partly for conversion into manufactures for export, and partly to meet rising domestic needs. So the global demand for commodities skyrocketed, lifting all exporters of commodities. These countries were mainly in central Asia, Africa and Latin America. All joined the great global boom.Alas, no boom based on over-consumption can last forever. The U.S. housing bubble burst, and prices started falling. This revealed the ugly fact that many lenders had made huge property loans to people who could not or would not repay. Banks and other mortgage lenders suddenly found themselves with hundreds of billions in bad debts. The consequent financial crunch hit the whole U.S. economy. This now threatens a ***recession**, which will lower consumer spending.Lower U.S. spending will mean a big drop in U.S. imports from Asia. When that happens, Asia will demand fewer commodities from Africa, Latin America and Central Asia. So, the very countries that benefited from U.S. overspending will now suffer as U.S. spending declines.HOW BAD WILL the impact on India be? It all depends on the pace at which the U.S. reduces its overspending to manageable proportions. Consider three scenarios.In scenario 1, the U.S. will only experience a slowdown, rather than an outright ***recession**, and will recover in the second half of 2008. There will be only a small blip in overspending, which will soon resume. World growth will not be badly hit, and India can hope to achieve 8% growth in 2008. This scenario looks hopelessly optimistic.More realistic is scenario 2, which postulates a ***recession** for two or three quarters in the U.S., followed by a recovery in 2009. This will hit the global economy significantly. Indian growth will decline to 7%.In scenario 3, the U.S. will suffer a prolonged slowdown with a ***recession** lasting 18 months or more. This is very unlikely, given the ammunition available to the U.S. Fed to revive the economy. Yet a cold shiver is running down the spines of stock market experts, who sense a small but significant chance of a long, painful slog. That will translate into huge global pain. Under these circumstances, India's GDP growth will fall to 6% -- no higher than in the 1990s.Even if the worst were to happen, it wouldn't mean that all recent progress was illusory. India has raised its savings rate to 34%, and built up strong skills that are here to stay. But our sustainable long-term growth rate, in less-than-booming global conditions, may be only 7-8%The last four years have been great, but let's not get too carried away.Swaminathan S.

The offering was priced at $14.50 per share and raised $195.1 million.""There was so much demand for the stock that we increased the size of the offering to nearly $200 million,"" President and CEO James P.

It climbed as high as $18.25 and closed at $17.72.Many major newspaper companies have struggled with declining returns over the past several years and have become less popular as investments. But some industry observers say a company like Dolan is not as vulnerable to the problems - such as decreasing circulation and advertising revenue - that have beset other newspaper publishers.Dolan Media does not refer to itself primarily as a newspaper company. Its business information division targets publications toward professionals in a number of major American cities, including Baltimore, Boston and New Orleans. Dolan has owned The Daily Record since 1994.Dolan has a professional services division that helps law firms and attorneys process mortgage defaults and court appeals. The company also sponsors professional events and seminars.Rick Edmonds, a media business analyst at the Poynter Institute, a media training center and think tank in St. Petersburg, Fla., said the newspaper industry's problems have affected chiefly larger papers, so investors may be more attracted to other types of publishing stocks.""Smaller community weekly shopper-type papers and specialized papers probably are less affected by some of those trends,"" he said.Dan Seideman, director at SNL Kagan, the media and communications division of the information and research firm SNL Financial in Charlottesville, Va., said business information is a growing industry.""People look at that and say this is something that that makes the company interesting and unique,"" he said.In a prospectus filed with the SEC, Dolan portrays itself as a balanced company that will be able to deliver regardless of market cycles. The company says public notices and mortgage default processing should do well during ***economic downturn**s. Those sources made up 55 percent of Dolan's revenue in the first quarter of 2007.Dolan reported a loss of $27.8 million for that quarter, which ended March 31, but much of that loss was from costs that the IPO was expected to eliminate. The company's debt has hurt its performance in recent years.The money from the IPO will be used to redeem about $101 million in preferred stock and pay off $30 million in bank debt, Dolan said in the filing.

61,4TXG-9570-TWCM-K1G7-00000-00.txt,"THE cutbacks at Time Inc.are starting to claim more senior people on the business side at the same time that the editorial cuts accelerate. And in a move likely to surprise no one, Time Inc.CEO Ann Moore has decided not to have a Christmas party this year. Last year, during the one December of the past four when there were no layoffs, Moore held an in-house party that featured the Time Inc.Glee Club, a buffet and beverages. This year, she decided to fire up to 600 people - and skip the party altogether. Meanwhile, at least 20 editorial people were axed yesterday by Rick Tetzeli, the managing editor of Entertainment Weekly. Elsewhere, the company said it was axing 92 people from the circulation and consumer-marketing departments. Some publications are looking for volunteers to leave. Sports Illustrated Group at first looked like it would be the hardest-hit by the job cuts, but Editor Terry McDonnell is actually looking for 40 people to step up across his entire group, which includes the sports weekly and related Web sites, Golf Magazine, SI for Kids and Sports Illustrated Latino. Staffers have until Nov. 24 to decide. People also is looking for 18 volunteers, and Rick Stengel, the top editor at Time, is seeking 20 employees to step forward. The editorial employees on People, Time and Sports Illustrated are covered by a union contract with the Newspaper Guild. Entertainment Weekly staffers are not covered, and thus were being cut outright yesterday. No numbers have been divulged yet for Fortune and Money. Time Inc.Editor-in-Chief John Huey already bounced Money's top editor, Eric Schurenberg, on Nov. 6, and replaced him with Fortune Executive Editor Craig Matters. On the business side, Matt Turck and Charles Kammerer, publishers of This Old House and Golf Magazine, respectively, were given the old heave-ho. Turck was actually quietly let go about two weeks ago, and was replaced by Associate Publisher Ginger Sutton, who will take over the responsibilities, but not get the title. Mad for O In the election-related weekly newsstand race, People magazine was beaten by sibling Time, which rushed its deadline to land on newsstands last Thursday with its cover of President-elect Barack Obama. But it looks like Larry Hackett, People's managing editor, made a good call with his cover. The weekly, which ordinarily sells about 1.4 million copies a week on newsstands, sold an estimated 2.2 million copies last week. Us Weekly Editor Janice Min's bet to run an Obama cover before the election also paid off handsomely. Last week's issue, which featured a cover shot of Obama and wife Michelle - and had to be shipped a day before Election Day because of print schedules - sold about 1 million copies. Time sells most of its rate base through subscriptions, but cranked out an additional 500,000 copies over its normal newsstand distribution. ""We went back to press three times,"" a Time spokeswoman said, adding that many copies have sold out. Two-timed  Doubledown Media, the struggling publisher of Trader Monthly, earlier this week became the latest magazine owner to announce layoffs. About a dozen staffers were let go, and three others were placed on furlough. Executives who are out include Richard Skeen, the president of sales, who will become a consultant, and General Manager Edward Padin. Among those who survived the cuts, about 10 executives have been asked to take 50-percent pay cuts. ""It's only temporary, to January,"" said Doubledown President and Editorial Director Randall Lane, one of those taking the pay cut. The move by Doubledown, which also publishes Private Air, Dealmaker, Corporate Leader and Cigar Report, probably isn't much of a surprise given that its target audience - Wall Street's upscale set - is fast disappearing with the credit crisis. ""They were like the froth on the top, and now that the bubble has burst they are in trouble,"" said one former staffer. In addition to facing a difficult market, Doubledown is embroiled in a legal skirmish with the founder of Private Air, Dee Dee Morrison, who claims she was cheated out of $1 million when she sold her magazine to the company. On the job cuts, Lane said what's confronting Doubledown is no different than what's been shaking the publishing world in general. ""What we're doing is trying to be smart like everyone else,"" he said. ""It's painful, but we're just tightening our belts.""  Media entrepreneur Jim Dunning, the company's principal backer, said he continues to fund the operation, noting that he ""just transferred more money"" yesterday. Dunning came on board 2 1/2 years ago, replacing original backer Magnus Greaves, and has pumped $7 million into the operation so far. He said he didn't think the tumult on Wall Street, or the fallout in the luxury market, would derail the company's progress long term. ""I'm very proud of what we are doing,"" said Dunning. ""Guys come and go in this industry. The whole world revolves around traders and hedge funds and that's right where we are.""  Not OK  Sales for OK! magazine slumped to fewer than 500,000 copies on newsstands last week, and some sources say that is what drew London- based owner Richard Desmond to briefly visit New York earlier this week. Northern + Shell, Desmond's company, lost approximately $35 million on the US edition of OK! last year, and sources said a big reason for hiring former Wenner Media general manager Kent Brownridge was to bring a halt to that red ink. Desmond originally vowed to spend at least $100 million on the US title before it turned a profit, and by most accounts, the threeyearold magazine has lost that amount since its inception. ""We're down, but less than the other guys,"" Brownridge said. ""I'm selling a lot better now than I was a couple of weeks ago. At the end of the year, when the smoke clears, I bet I'll be up.""  Meanwhile, Brownridge said this week's issue of OK! has been converted into a double issue because he didn't want to move the shipment date up due to the Thanksgiving holiday. Lyon-ize  Bill Buford, a New Yorker contributor who at one time was the magazine's fiction editor, is heading to France. He denied reports that his contract isn't being renewed, because he said, ""There was no contract to renew, I wrote on a piece-by-piece basis."" Buford insisted that he and Editor-in-Chief David Remnick worked out the deal a year in advance, and that his departure has nothing to do with the 5 percent job cuts taking place at The New Yorker parent Condé Nast.

62,4TMT-RJ00-TX12-N0NP-00000-00.txt,"c(""Oct. 9--OAKLAND -- Hundreds of people flooded the Oakland Technical High School auditorium in North Oakland on Wednesday night to urge the school board not to shut down more than a dozen schools just to save money.They didn't have to say a word. From his seat on the stage -- aptly, under a bright spotlight -- school board President David Kakishiba announced that what they feared would not happen.\""It's simply not the case that we'll be closing schools on a big scale tonight or in the future,\"" Kakishiba said, prompting cheers from the crowd.Kakishiba and other school officials apologized to the public for leading them to believe that the district would try to solve its fiscal woes by closing up to 15 schools, a scenario explored in a staff presentation taken to six community meetings last month.\""I just want to apologize for whatever and however that came about,\"" Kakishiba said, adding, \""That's not the path this school board or this school district is taking.\""Despite the palpable sense of relief in the audience -- which thinned, considerably, by the time the board actually discussed how the district might reduce costs and draw more funding -- the school system faces huge fiscal challenges.This year, the district's budget was balanced for the first time since the state takeover, but schools made deep cuts. And, because of the state's ***economic crisis**, Oakland is bracing for another round in the year tocome. Another nagging problem is its shrinking enrollment: The district has lost some 15,000 students in the past eight years, as well as the state funding that followed them.To add to the financial stress, teachers and other employees are negotiating new contracts with the district. The need for pay raises -- which would cost millions of additional dollars -- has been widely recognized.Some of the teachers, students and parents at the meeting offered their own suggestions for how to make ends meet, from improving attendance and aggressively recruiting more students to cutting central administrative office costs and persuading the state to forgive some of the district's huge debt.In 2003, the state issued Oakland Unified School District a multimillion-dollar emergency loan and stripped the school board of its governing authority -- powers that the board is in the midst of regaining.While the board agreed not to close a large number of schools for cost savings, they did not say that they wouldn't close any schools -- although some board members said that all closures should be off the table. Instead, the board agreed that district staff should continue monitoring all schools, especially those that are struggling academically and have low enrollment, as staff members have in the past.In addition to academic and enrollment considerations, however, staff will look at the schools' neighborhoods. In the past, a large number of schools in predominately African-American areas have been targeted for closure, and school officials said they want to make sure the closures don't affect some communities more than others.Shawnda Payton, who came with her daughter Brooklyn, a student at Fremont Federation's Media Academy, said it all sounded a bit vague to her. Still, she said, she came to the meeting very worried and anxious, and she left relieved.\""I was nuts at first, but now I'm OK,\"" she said. \""I can breathe now, because my daughter loves her school.\""Reach Katy Murphy at 510-208-6424 or kmurphy@bayareanewsgroup.comTo see more of The Oakland Tribune or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.insidebayarea.com/oaklandtribune/.

63,4TNK-RS00-TW8F-G12H-00000-00.txt,"  But will the banks lend to each other?  At the end of a weekend when nearly all of the world's major bankers and finance ministers gathered in Washington to stanch the global credit crisis, there was no assurance that credit would flow when markets reopen this week.  In an effort to get credit moving, European leaders on Sunday promised to guarantee new loans to banks, which have stopped lending to one another as the crisis has deepened. But they left it up to each nation's government to provide details of how its own banking system would be protected. Australia also announced such guarantees, but there was no similar announcement from the United States, where officials declined to say what action, if any, they would take.  Until the credit crisis intensified after Lehman Brothersfailed, banks lent freely to each other. This assured that each bank would have money if needed for any number of business purposes, like lending to their clients.   But after Lehman's demise resulted in some banks not getting paid money that was owed them, banks became leery of lending to each other to avoid the same thing happening again. The tightening of credit led banks to hold on to cash, fearful that they might not be able to borrow if they needed to do so, and meant they were less willing to lend to companies that needed money to finance their inventories and even their payrolls.     This crisis of confidence in the credit markets raised concerns about the likelihood of a deep ***recession** and was a precipitating factor in the stock market's steep plunge last week. That banks remain afraid to lend to each other has reduced confidence in the financial system, as investors questioned why they should have faith in banks if other banks did not trust their peers.  Many of the financial support measures rushed through by American and European leaders recently have been aimed at restoring that lost faith. But while it is not at all clear that a return to normal lending between banks would restore credit availability to companies that are finding it difficult to borrow, it is hard to imagine that happening unless the interbank market starts functioning smoothly again. Denmark sought to overcome this problem last week by guaranteeing all loans between banks, an unprecedented initiative that its parliament approved Sunday, the same day other European countries promised to do something similar.  The United States has so far not embraced such guarantees, which would go well beyond previous practices and draw the government yet more rapidly into the ***financial crisis**.   Instead, to help companies more directly, it has agreed to make loans to businesses that can no longer borrow in the commercial paper market, and Congress has approved a $700 billion bailout fund that will be used to purchase bank assets and to buy stock in financial institutions. It has also raised the level of deposit insurance in banks to $250,000 per depositor from $100,000.   And while a growing chorus of voices is urging the government to consider guaranteeing interbank lending, there is concern that such a move would risk putting taxpayers on the hook for far more if a failing bank borrowed heavily in that market to offset falling deposits.   Seeking to assure investors that the financial systems would return to normal,  the finance ministers of the Group of 7, the major industrial countries, announced a set of five general principles on Friday night.  Bankers immediately complained that they needed more information and remained reluctant to lend until politicians were clearer on how the rescue plans would work.  ''These are the right principles,'' said Josef Ackermann, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank. ''It needs much more specific details.''   The European announcement on Sunday, made after a summit meeting in Paris, did not include a Europe-wide fund, which some governments have resisted out of fear they would have to bail out banks in other countries.  That left it possible that some banks would get a competitive advantage from having guarantees from a government that was thought to be better able to meet its new obligations if a major bank were to fail.  ''Once this has sunk in, people are going to think about the consolidated balance sheets of governments,'' said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund and now a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  ''Some of these banks have $2 trillion to $3 trillion balance sheets, which is huge compared to the capacity'' of such governments as Britain and Germany, he said.  Mr. Johnson said he thought the United States might have to follow if Europe came up with effective guarantees.  Without a uniform international standard for such guarantees, Mr. Ackerman warned that cash would flow from unprotected banking systems to protected ones, what is known as ''regulatory arbitrage.''   That could also happen within the United States if loans between commercial banks were guaranteed but loans to savings associations, brokerage firms and insurance companies were not.  Behind that lurks another risk: Some bankers said that they dared not resume normal lending in the interbank market, in part because investors might think that banks making loans to weaker institutions were taking on too much risk. One promise from the finance ministers was to ''support systemically important financial institutions and prevent their failure.''   On Friday, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, refused to say whether Goldman Sachs, the firm he used to run, or Morgan Stanley, whose share price has collapsed, qualified as such an institution. But by Sunday the government appeared ready to provide some sort of support for that company.  Part of the weekend was devoted to promises that this would never happen again, with bankers saying they had strengthened their risk management systems and expected new regulatory arrangements to be made.  Richard Fisher, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said the Fed had moved quickly to stem the crisis and would do more as needed. But he was silent on what role, if any, the Fed had played in bringing on the crisis.  There were plenty of ''I told you so's,'' with two of the most poignant ones coming from Jacob A. Frenkel and William R. Rhodes.  Each of them, well-known economists active in international forums, had warned about the risks of a financial system growing more and more leveraged, with house prices rising to unsustainable levels.  ''We were ignored,'' Mr. Rhodes said in a speech to the Institute of International Finance, a group of the major financial institutions, of which he is a vice chairman.  Among those who evidently disregarded the warnings were their employers. Mr. Frenkel, formerly the governor of the Central Bank of Israel, is vice chairman of American International Group. Mr. Rhodes is a  senior vice chairman of Citigroup.  In a speech to the institute, Mr. Frenkel complained that the new G-7 principles left many important questions unanswered.  ''How?'' he inquired after reading the finance ministers' promise to ''unfreeze credit and money markets.''   ''What about the ones that are not?'' he asked after reading the promise to keep ''systemically important'' institutions from failing.  Monday is a partial holiday in the United States, with the stock market open but some banks celebrating Columbus Day. That could delay until Tuesday the development of clear evidence of whether the banks are still afraid to lend to each other -- and of whether the credit crisis will continue to worsen.",0,,,

65,7W3D-MCV1-2R2Y-7498-00000-00.txt,"c(""Jul. 2--Mayor Charles Meeker said today that Raleigh's ability to emerge from the current ***recession** quickly will be tied to its ability to promote sustainable living and better public transportation for its residents.Meeker spoke at a news conference where he discussed U.S. Census Bureau data showing that Raleigh has been the fastest growing large city in the South in recent years among municipalities with populations of 100,000 or larger. The data accompanied an article that ran in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal.Raleigh grew at a 3.8 percent clip between July 1, 2007 and July 1, 2008, according to census data released this week. The city's population increased 14,368 during that time to reach 392,552.Meeker said continuing that healthy growth will require Raleigh to become a leader in efforts to reduce energy costs. He touted the city's efforts to add more hybrid vehicles, install energy-efficient LED lights and make use of solar panels on some city buildings.As for public transportation, Meeker said Raleigh can't continue to grow at its current pace without improving its public transportation infrastructure.\""Our community needs to go ahead and solve this problem,\"" he said.Meeker said he's confident the General Assembly will pass a local-option sales tax measure for bus and rail transit service during its current session.The measure would let commissioners in several urban counties, including Wake, levy a half-cent sales tax -- if local voters agree -- for bus and rail transit improvements. The money also could be used on express highway lanes for buses and car pools.Meeker said he hopes a referendum for the transit sales tax can be held in the fall of 2010.Meeker also said the Dorothea Dix campus will play heavily in Raleigh's future attractiveness. He said the city must work with the state on a proposal to turn Dix's 306-acre campus into a park.\""I don't know any other city our size that has this kind of opportunity,\"" Meeker said.Meeker said he plans to speak to Gov. Beverly Perdue about the future of Dix after the state adopts a budget.Meeker said he believes Raleigh can sustain annual growth levels of between two and four percent going forward, particularly if the city becomes more urbanized instead of continuing to sprawl out in different directions.Meeker said people should be more focused on how the city grows, and less on just how fast it is growing. \""The quality of the growth is more important than the pace of the growth,\"" he said.To see more of The News &amp; Observer, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.newsobserver.com.

66,4TT6-HHP0-TX4K-904M-00000-00.txt,"The Associated PressANSTED - The campaign signs Gerald Skaggs has strung to his fence and flagpole - ""Had Enough? Vote Democrat"" - prompt passersby on U.S. 60 to stop and talk. Sometimes a bit too much.After listening to Skaggs argue the merits of Barack Obama's plans for the country, a recent visitor came to a grudging conclusion: ""I guess I'll have to vote for that - - - - - -.""Racial slurs have hardly disappeared here. But many voters in this 95 percent white, decidedly working-class state - and presumably, elsewhere in America - are fed up with a lousy economy and current leaders, and Democrats hope they will re-embrace their blue-collar and party roots, swallow any misgivings about race and support a black man for president.The highway visitor's offhand comment speaks volumes about how bad things have gotten since West Virginia helped elect Republican President Bush in 2000 and 2004.""He's gonna vote for Obama,"" says Skaggs, a 61-year-old Navy veteran and former mechanic. ""Because of the issues. Period.""""People don't have money to buy stuff with. They're having to figure out whether they're going to eat or pay their rent,"" Skaggs says. ""We can't stand that. What if we get another four years like that?""National polls showed Democrat Obama and Republican John McCain in a close race until the crisis began in September; then Obama opened up a lead in most surveys. Still, polling shows McCain continuing to lead in West Virginia.Race remains an issue as the contest plays out.An AP-Yahoo survey in September showed that one-third of white Democrats in the U.S. agree with at least one negative adjective when applied to blacks, and they're less likely to vote for Obama than those who don't feel that way.But AP polling shows Obama is slowly pulling in former supporters of Hillary Clinton, who trounced him in West Virginia's Democratic primary by more than 2-to-1.The party and major unions have been trying to smooth the way for him.State Democratic Vice Chairwoman Belinda Biafore says she persuaded one elderly woman at a Wal-Mart to support Obama by feigning ignorance that he was black and claiming she'd only heard him on the radio.""'And all I hear is him saying 'I'm going to help you with health care and taxes and all those things that Hillary talked about,'"" she told the woman. ""'Really? He's black? I'm going to go home and turn the TV on!'""She said, 'You know, you make a good point.'""In the primary, Biafore said, it was about picking the party's face. Now, ""it's more about the issues and going back to the values we were raised with.""Obama has taken his slight surge seriously enough to sink advertising money into West Virginia, and he sent running mate Joe Biden to Charleston last Friday. But he has not set foot in the state since a pre-primary visit to Charleston in May.Ansted, a coal-country town of about 1,500, is a place where blacks and whites mingle on the streets, chat together on the porch of the local convenience store and generally live in harmony - but their homes tend to be in separate parts of town.Not everyone is ready to put race aside, says heating contractor Steve Legg, a 55-year-old independent who expects Obama to lose.""I hate to say it,"" he admits, ""but most of it's just prejudice.""Sure, union campaigns by teachers, miners and steelworkers might be helping Obama.""But when a man goes in there and gets ready to pull the ticket,"" he says, ""he's gonna vote his heart.""A record 1.2 million West Virginians are registered to vote, and as usual, Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly 2-to-1. But the number of independent and third-party voters has grown faster than those of both major parties combined. They now account for 15 percent of all people registered.To West Virginians, the decision isn't just about race and the economy. There are concerns about religion, patriotism and veterans' care, gun control, taxes and support for organized labor.""I'm really mixed up as to who to vote for,"" says Roberto DeLeon, a Masontown barber who boasts the cheapest haircuts in Preston County, just $6 for seniors.""I am a Republican and I would vote for McCain,"" DeLeon says. ""However, I'm also a veteran ... and from what I understand, Obama has supported the veterans a lot more than McCain has. But Obama is against gun ownership. The NRA does not endorse Obama. And I'm a hunter. I have guns. So I'm kind of split there.""And what do his customers say?""The majority of them are going to vote for Obama, from what I hear,"" he says.People lost confidence in McCain when he chose Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, despite her apparent lack of knowledge about world politics and economics, he says.""But on the other hand,"" DeLeon says with a laugh, ""she's a hunter.""At his grocery store 130 miles south in Rosedale, 38-year-old Brian James hears a lot of talk, too. Most favors Obama.""They're tired of Republicans, is what I'm hearing,"" he says. ""They're just ready to get out from under the Republican Party and let the Democrats do another chance. ... Even people that don't like either one seem to be pushing more toward Obama.""",0,,,

68,4RR3-FC70-TX2W-X0XB-00000-00.txt,"In moving with unusual speed to cut interest rates, officials at the Federal Reserve are aiming to prevent a nationwide ***recession**, but they're also doing something more targeted: throwing a lifeline directly to the beleaguered banking industry.The Fed says that it isn't trying to bail out anyone. Rather, its move is grounded partly in concern that banking troubles could deepen, choking off credit to the whole economy at a precarious time.The pace of consumer spending stalled in December, according to government data released Thursday. America's businesses are also on edge, with slow job creation causing a rise in unemployment. In response, the central bank is moving to stimulate growth. But it is also trying to forestall a possible bank meltdown that would worsen the situation.The interest-rate cuts could give financial firms some breathing room to absorb losses tied to home loans.""This is more about Wall Street than Main Street,"" says Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board, a business-sponsored research group in New York. ""We've got the monetary strategy we've got because financial markets are nervous.""The Fed pointed to this anxiety, and to the risk it poses, in announcing its latest moves. ""Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households,"" the Federal Open Market Committee said in the statement accompanying the rate cut on Wednesday.Citing ""downside risks"" to the economy, the statement again pointed to Wall Street, saying it ""will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects"" in deciding future policy actions. The key point: Financial developments have an impact that extends beyond the geography of Manhattan or the paychecks of investment bankers - many of whom are going without million-dollar bonuses this year. Deepest cuts since the '80sSince September, the Fed has now cut its short-term interest rate, charged among banks for overnight loans, from 5.25 percent to 3 percent.Much of that cut has happened just in recent days. On Wednesday, the Fed's policy committee voted to cut its short-term interest rate by half a percentage point, barely a week after an emergency rate cut of 0.75 percentage point.A cut of that magnitude hasn't been seen since the 1980s, and these moves together signal a Fed now on high alert against a possible ***recession**.The Fed hopes that interest-rate cuts will help stimulate consumer and business spending, since lower rates make borrowing more attractive and saving less attractive.The big picture also includes what central bankers call ""risk management."" Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues consider where the greatest risks to the economy lie - whether on the side of inflation (with too much monetary stimulus) or contraction (with too little money supply).At certain times, they'll emphasize mitigating the biggest risk they see. Right now, that's the risk of an unhealthy banking system.Wall Street, broadly defined to include banking and related industries, plays a vital role in supplying credit to consumers and businesses. If the flow of credit tightens more dramatically, the result could be a deep ***recession**, rather than the mild slowdown for the US economy that many economists now predict in 2008.Even in mild form, a ***recession** could be hard on Main Street, with unemployment rising amid slack consumer demand. ""There are three things that worry the average consumer or household,"" Mr. Goldstein says. ""Their job, their job, and their job.""In Wall Street, signs of troubleMost financial firms are weathering the storm. Yet signs of trouble abound:* In a recently published analysis, economist Gary Shilling counts 210 US mortgage lenders that have closed, curbed operations, entered bankruptcy, or been acquired in fire-sale conditions since 2006.* Policymakers are increasingly worried about companies specializing in insuring mortgage-related bonds against default. Insurer MBIA Inc. reported a quarterly loss of $2.3 billion Thursday.* Problems for banks have spread beyond mortgage defaults to include rising delinquencies on car loans and credit cards, and expectations that corporate-bond defaults will rise as well.Thomas Palley, a Washington economist, says that interest-rate cuts can help banks and financial firms in several ways. Lower rates allow banks to reap a higher profit on new loans, as the spread widens between their own borrowing costs and the rates they charge others.Also, rate cuts tend to boost the price of financial assets such as bonds. By lowering the cost of mortgage loans, it could also help stabilize a slumping housing market that has saddled banks with record numbers of costly foreclosures.In a recent post on his website, Mr. Palley calls the latest rate cuts ""welfare for Wall Street."" That doesn't mean the move is bad for Main Street. But he says America needs to consider how to avoid repeats of this situation, in which the banking industry goes through cycles of taking on excessive risks, and the whole economy suffers as a result. ""We need a much deeper and more severe conversation"" about bank regulation, he says.Economists generally say lower interest rates are needed now, but may increase inflation down the road. That's a price the economy pays for ""risk management.""(c) Copyright 2008. The Christian Science Monitor",1,,,

However, the losses were considerably lower than in previous quarters. The  company reported a defection of 991,000 customers in the second quarter, and 1.25 million customers in the first quarter. Daniel R. Hesse, chief executive, told investors in a conference call that Sprint was just beginning to turn the corner.  ''We had some successes in the third quarter, but we still have much progress to make,'' Mr. Hesse said. ''We are far from satisfied that we have not returned to subscriber growth.''Sprint, the third-largest wireless carrier in the United States after AT&amp;T and Verizon, is slowly beginning to change the public perception of poor customer service and call quality, Mr. Hesse said. The company is  selling new phone models  that it hopes will help retain customers. ''A year ago, our device lineup was considered a weakness,'' Mr. Hesse said in an interview. ''And now, a lot of people consider us to have one of the strongest lineups in the industry.''  In June, Sprint introduced the Palm Pre, its sleek smartphone, and recently announced plans to begin selling the Palm Pixi, a smartphone geared toward younger users. In addition, Sprint began selling the HTC Hero this month. It also said it would begin selling in November the Samsung Moment, which will also run on Android, Google's mobile operating system.   The company said Thursday that it lost $478 million, or 17 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with $326 million, or 11 cents, in the same period a year ago.  Wall Street analysts had expected a loss of 15 cents a share,  according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. Sprint's stock fell 15 cents, or 4.63 percent, to $3.09 Thursday.  Revenue declined 9 percent, to $8.04 billion, beating analysts' forecast of a loss of $8.09 billion.Sprint is increasing the number of  customers who pay in advance for cellphone service, which has helped offset the loss of business consumers. The company has been heavily marketing its Boost Mobile brand, which offers a $50-a-month unlimited voice, data and texting. In July, Spring announced plans to acquire Virgin Mobile USA, a prepaid operator. Prepaid customers, who do not sign a long-term contract, do not generate as much revenue as postpaid customers who sign contracts.   ''If you look at what elements of the industry are seeing growth, it's prepaid,''  Mr. Hesse said. ''Absolutely, we'd like to be the leader in the prepaid, but it's still a smaller part of Sprint's business.''Sprint's difficulties in retaining subscribers have been worsened by the ***recession** and the saturation of the wireless industry, said Craig Moffett, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. ''Sprint is a better company than it was a year ago, but unfortunately, it's a less attractive industry than it was a year ago,'' he said.  Mr. Moffett said the mobile industry was going to become even more challenging for all of the wireless carriers. ''This is a company that is learning how to swim just as the water is getting drained out of the swimming pool,'' he said. ''There's not enough growth in the wireless market for them to pull off a turnaround.''   Mr. Hesse  emphasized the importance of  Sprint's next-generation wireless network. The company has introduced  the service, in conjunction with its affiliate Clearwire, in 17  American cities, with plans to continue deployment next year. ''We think 4G will move the needle,'' he said. ''We'll be the only game in town in 2010. That's a big deal.''"",

71,7V2C-40H0-Y9J0-Y0CR-00000-00.txt,"c(""Feb. 19--It is becoming increasingly clear that the massive \""stimulus\"" bill rushed through Congress and signed by the president Monday, was neither intended nor designed to be an economic stimulus bill in the classic Keynesian sense.Under Keynesian theory (which is shaky, but leave that aside for the moment), the important thing for the government to do in a downturn is to inject as much money into as many parts of the economy as possible, as quickly as possible.The quickest way is through tax cuts or (as some suggested) suspending the Social Security and Medicare taxes (both systems are financially unsustainable in their present form anyway) for at least a year, giving people more money in their pockets right away. Another way to do stimulus, as Robert Rector, welfare and entitlement analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation, reminded us, would have been to give everybody who received an Earned Income Tax Credit payment last year another payment of similar size immediately. \""You could have injected $50 billion into the economy in 14 days, and done it through putting money into the hands of low-income people,\"" Mr. Rector told us.The bill did expand the EITC and create several other \""tax credits\"" for people who didn't have enough income to pay taxes. But it won't put that money into the economy until April 2010. Some quick stimulus! One particularly egregious aspect of the bill is that it essentially overturned one of the signal policy achievements of the 1990s, the welfare reform bill signed by former President Clinton in 1996. That reform not only reduced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children caseload by two-thirds, it reduced the poverty rate, especially for minority children, and put millions of formerly dependent people to work and on the road to independence.The mechanism was simple. Prior to 1996, the federal government essentially subsidized state governments for each new person added to the welfare rolls (and punished them by removing funding when people went off welfare, a perverse incentive). The 1996 reform gave each state a block grant, calculated on the basis of population and other factors, giving states an incentive to target money at those who truly needed it and the flexibility to spend the money effectively. It worked.The new \""stimulus\"" bill, however, provides $4 billion to be spent by paying 80 percent of the cost of each new recipient. So for every $1 a state spends on a new welfare \""client,\"" a state gets $4 in \""free\"" money from the feds. The incentive, then, is to add as many people as possible to the welfare rolls. Mickey Kaus, the heterodox liberal blogger for the online magazine Slate called it a \""liberal conspiracy to expand the welfare rolls.\"" Was this change triggered by the need for extra assistance during a ***recession**? Hardly. The reform law included a contingency fund for quick distribution to states with high unemployment. That fund could have been increased, to be distributed under the old formula. Besides, the bill included an expansion of unemployment benefits. It is difficult to interpret the decision to change the funding formula and eliminate the Clinton-era welfare reform measure as anything other than a deliberate attempt to increase the number of people dependent on government welfare payments.The bill also contains a half dozen new entitlements or expansions of existing programs. The cost is variously estimated (people are still scanning the 1,400-page bill that no member of Congress could possibly have read for more surprises) at between $220 billion and $250 billion a year in ongoing additional welfare spending.If these radical increases in the welfare state had been proposed through ordinary congressional procedures -- subcommittee hearings, witnesses from all sides, committee hearings, proposed amendments, a modicum of publicity -- it is unlikely they would have stood a chance of passing. But the bill was assembled in secret and passed in haste encouraged by presidential inducement of panic, without even a pretense of due deliberation.

Either help the auto industry or don't, as the nation's interests dictate, but don't throw executive-office offerings to the angry mobs to ""prove"" that you're tough guys.I'm getting the sense that we have another administration on the way that's high on symbolism and low on effective action --- the domestic version of Bill Clinton's missiles-to-mud-huts national security policy.http://www.ajc.com/opinion/content/shared-blogs/ajc/thinkingright/entries/2008/12/08/grovel_for_the_mob_mr_ceo.html",1,,,
73,4TK3-KGF0-TWK1-80NR-00000-00.txt,"Cheers: To the state Department of Ecology for deciding not to enforce a rule. Ordinarily, we like to see rules followed, but when a rule is just plain silly - such as banning the washing of cars in driveways - we're willing to tolerate some lax enforcement.The Columbian's Michael Andersen reported Thursday that the DOE will ask local governments to write a ban on driveway car washing into code, but likely will not expect the rule to be enforced until some indefinite time in the future.We hope that time is never. Perhaps that will give DOE officials enough time to come to their senses. After Andersen reported the ban on driveway car washes earlier this month, much of Washington state went ballistic (including The Columbian in a Sept. 18 editorial).Let's all focus on ways to clean up water running into storm drains, but let's not throw the baby out with the car-wash water.Jeers: To Washington state Democratic Party officials for wasting time dragging Republican gubernatorial candidate Dino Rossi to court and trying to reverse his decision to identify himself as ""prefers GOP"" on the Nov. 4 ballot. A Seattle judge correctly ruled Friday morning that the ballot description is allowable. Such wording is at the discretion of each candidate, even if it's the ""Salmon Yoga Party"" as one candidate chose for the Aug. 19 primary ballot.Secretary of State Sam Reed had already ruled correctly that Rossi's choice was permissible. Of course, the consequences for Rossi's choice might be more negative than positive, as he continues to face repeated scrutiny (as he should) for eschewing the ""Republican"" brand.The cynic would suggest that the Machiavellian Democrats knew all along that they would lose this case in court (the Dems said Friday they wouldn't appeal the judge's decision), and all along were simply trying to draw attention to and drag out the criticism of Rossi's controversial ballot wording. Oh, no! That couldn't be the case, could it?Cheers: To The Amphitheater at Clark County for setting an attendance record last Sunday night. More than 17,300 fans attended the concert featuring Journey, Heart and Cheap Trick, breaking the record of about 16,000 at a Jimmy Buffett concert in 2003.The amphitheater continues through difficult times, however. This year there were nine concerts, down from 11 in each of the two previous years and a peak of 16 in 2004. Amphitheaters nationwide were sailing into choppy financial waters for several years even before the current ***economic crisis**.We hope the local amphitheater stays in business. The economic boost and cultural contributions are good for the community. Sunday's concert proved that large crowds are possible, and we hope more such turnouts can be generated next year.Cheers: To Jason Lee Middle School teacher Susan Wiggs for winning her case against the Vancouver Education Association (the teachers union) and preserving her right to send part of her union dues to the charity of her choice. Compulsory union membership is bad enough, but what's even worse is a union sending money to political causes with which some union members strongly disagree.The teachers' union was properly denied two appeals of this case to the Public Employment Relations Commission in Olympia, and has announced it will no longer pursue the case.We hope the local amphitheater stays in business.",1,,,

No consensus had been reached by late Friday, but some economists say it's increasingly likely state unemployment could top 12 percent.Rebecca Rust, chief economist with the Florida Agency for Workforce Innovation, said it's possible unemployment will surpass Florida's 11.9 percent peak during the 1975 ***recession**, \""but we're going to hope stimulus funds help pull us out.\""Prior to the '70s, analysts would have to stretch to the Great Depression for higher levels of joblessness. But the methodology for estimating unemployment was different then, making direct comparisons difficult.The state's jobless figure for June, up from a revised 10.3 percent a month earlier, represents 970,000 out-of-work Floridians in a statewide workforce of 9.19million.In the Tampa Bay region, unemployment jumped a half percentage point, from an adjusted 10.6 percent in May to 11.1 percent. Hernando County, where unemployment reached 13.1 percent, continued to be the hardest hit in the region.Michael McHugh, business development director for Hernando County, said Hernando's heavy dependence on the construction industry made it one of the first to feel the ***recession**'s bite. And a summertime drop-off in tourism hurts employment prospects even more.\""It's very hard to look at these numbers month to month,'' McHugh said.Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness, was somewhat surprised by the latest numbers - not that unemployment continues to drift up, but that the jump was so sizable.\""If you're in search of green shoots in the economy, the labor market is not the place to look,\"" Snaith said. \""That earth has been salted by this ***recession**.\""Over the past year, the bay area has shed 55,400 jobs, second among Florida metro areas only to Miami-Fort Lauderdale's drop of 96,400 jobs. All told, there are about 147,000 bay area residents counted as unemployed.Overall, Florida has been losing jobs at a quicker pace than the national average. The national unemployment rate was 9.5 percent for June.Friday's news was simultaneous with national reports raising hopes that the ***recession** may be in its final throes: an earnings boost at some megabanks and an unexpected jump in housing construction in June to the highest level in seven months.Rust cited several economic pluses in Florida: housing starts and housing sales are both up month over month and foreclosures are down; tax revenues came in slightly higher than expected; and the state's employflorida.com job site posted 300,000 openings in the month of June.But often in ***recession**s, unemployment continues to rise or remains high even after the economy starts improving. Nationally, the unemployment rate is widely expected to top 10 percent early next year.Florida's unemployment rate could rise another few percentage points before we're through, economist Scott Brown with Raymond James Financial in St. Petersburg said Friday.\""It's anybody's guess if it's going to top out at 12 or 13 percent. It's hard to put a fine point on it,\"" Brown added.\""This may not be even a jobless recovery. This could be a job-loss recovery, like we saw after the 2001 ***recession** where we kept losing jobs even after the economy recovered.\""Adding to the job market frustration is the rising tide of long-term jobless. As part of the federal stimulus package, states are receiving hundreds of millions of dollars to extend coverage for the unemployed who have exhausted regular insurance benefits while still unable to find work.But a report Friday from the National Employment Law Project argues that aid isn't enough. Barring a dramatic turnaround in hiring, the group estimates that 540,000 Americans will exhaust their unemployment benefits by the end of September, and 1.5 million, including more than 130,000 Floridians, will run out of coverage by year's end.\""It is clear we are coming up on a tidal wave of need for more extensions and help from the federal government,\"" said Andrew Stettner, deputy director of group, an advocacy group for low-wage workers that tracks unemployment data.The housing bust paved the way into the ***recession** three years ago, but it's since morphed into a widespread downturn.One of the few exceptions in Florida, the health care and social assistance sector, is up a meager 1 percent in jobs year over year. One subset of that category sticks out: there are 6,100 more jobs in nursing care facilities than a year ago, a 6.5 percent increase.Times staff writer Barbara Behrendt contributed to this report.

75,7V79-DTC0-Y8TC-S28Y-00000-00.txt,"The real estate industry in New York City is mobilizing with an intensity not seen in years as it faces an almost unheard-of possibility: a court order that it may have to return hundreds of millions of dollars in rent.  The state appeals court decision bars New York City landlords from deregulating apartment rents while receiving a popular tax break meant to encourage building renovations. Industry officials say the decision could affect as many as 80,000 apartments in the city, trigger widespread defaults on loans, eliminate construction jobs and reduce property tax revenues for the city.  ''We all understand that this would be disastrous,'' said Joseph Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a group representing 25,000 property owners and managers.  Tenant advocates said the real estate industry was exaggerating the impact of the decision. The problem is not the decision, but the landlords who misinterpreted state law, they said.The Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court ruled on March 5 that the landlord for Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, adjoining complexes with 11,232 apartments on the East Side of Manhattan, had improperly deregulated more than 3,000 apartments and raised rents beyond prescribed levels, while receiving special property tax breaks from the city.   A lawyer for the tenants who brought the suit estimated that the decision could cost the landlord, Tishman Speyer Properties, more than $200 million if it is forced to repay tenants for improper rent increases over the last four years.   But the consequences extend far beyond Stuyvesant Town.   The tax breaks, known as the J-51 program, have been given to thousands of landlords, large and small, for building renovations. If the ruling stands, any landlord who deregulated rents after receiving the tax exemptions might have to repay tenants for rent overcharges.   On Thursday afternoon, Tishman Speyer filed a motion asking the Appellate Division for permission to take the case to the Court of Appeals and to hold off carrying out the decision until there is a final resolution.   The court granted the stay on Friday, but put off deciding whether to allow the appeal. It also said that starting in April, Tishman Speyer must put into an interest-bearing escrow account the difference between the rent it charged for the affected apartments and the rent it would have charged if the apartments were still subject to rent regulations.  There are about a million apartments with regulated rents in New York City. Under state law, landlords can deregulate an apartment when the rent for a vacant apartment reaches $2,000 or more per month, or the rent is above $2,000 and a tenant's household income is above $175,000 for two consecutive years. Once deregulated, the landlord can raise the rent to market rate.  But in cases where landlords make significant building renovations, they are allowed to pass along a portion of the renovation costs to the tenants' rent. As a result, landlords can raise rents that exceed or approach the $2,000 deregulation threshold.The Bloomberg administration, which had supported Tishman Speyer's record-$5breaking.4 billion purchase of Stuyvesant Town in 2006, has not taken a position on the case.  The court decision has also intensified the real estate industry's opposition to proposed legislation in Albany that would expand rent regulations and severely undercut building owners' abilities to raise rents quickly. Tenant advocates, citing skyrocketing rents and the loss of housing for poor and working-class tenants during the real estate boom, have made a concerted effort to lobby elected officials to strengthen the regulatory system.  A package of 10 pro-tenant bills was approved by the State Assembly earlier this year and sent to the Senate, where landlords have focused their lobbying efforts. In the past, the real estate industry depended on Republican leadership in the Senate -- which the Democrats now control, by  32 to 30 members -- or a sympathetic Republican governor to block such bills.  ''Everybody's worried,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, the industry's influential lobbying arm. ''This is legislation that'll ruin housing and ruin investment.''  Mr. Spinola was in Albany two weeks ago, lobbying the Senate majority leader, Malcolm A. Smith; Senator Pedro Espada Jr. of the Bronx; Senator Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, the Republican minority leader; and others. This week, members of the Community Housing Improvement Program, an association representing apartment building owners in the city, made their own lobbying trip to Albany.   Mr. Strasburg, of the stabilization association, has called for an industry summit meeting in April. His group is also appealing to building contractors and unions that it says would lose work if landlords stopped renovating their buildings because of the proposed legislation or the court decision.  ''All of a sudden, people who had dropped off the face of our earth have re-emerged and seen the seriousness of this,'' Mr. Strasburg said.   Tenant advocates say that hundreds of thousands of formerly rent-regulated apartments have been converted to luxury rentals over the past decade, contributing to a housing crisis in New York. Michael McKee, treasurer of the Tenants Political Action Committee, said he argued 12 years ago that the state was improperly allowing landlords of buildings receiving J-51 tax breaks to deregulate apartments and raise rents.   ''The tenant movement has never been more united,'' Mr. McKee said.   It was the 2006 sale of Stuyvesant Town, a traditionally working- and middle-class enclave where more than three-quarters of the apartments were rent-regulated, that galvanized tenant advocates. Tishman Speyer's purchase was based on the idea that it could profit by removing apartments from rent stabilization after significant renovations.  But tenants facing rent increases of 20 to 30 percent filed a lawsuit in 2007 arguing that Tishman Speyer had no right to deregulate apartments in buildings that had received $24.5 million in tax breaks since 1992 under the J-51 program.   The program was designed to encourage landlords to make building improvements.The State Supreme Court initially dismissed the case, but the Appellate Division ruled in the tenants' favor, seriously undercutting Tishman Speyer's ability to increase revenues from the complexes. The company was already under financial pressure from bondholders because the process of converting apartments to market rates has gone more slowly than expected.  If the court decision stands, apartments that had been improperly deregulated would again be subject to rent regulations and landlords would have to repay tenants for rent increases that exceeded annual increases set by the Rent Guidelines Board over the past four years. In some cases, the law allows tenants to seek triple damages.  Many large landlords contend they relied on the guidance of the state's housing agency when they deregulated apartments. But the Appellate Division also relied on documents from the housing agency, as well as state law. Indeed, the state Division of Housing and Community Renewal, in a 1995 operational guideline, insisted that buildings receiving tax breaks could not be deregulated.  Last week, the Division of Housing and Community Renewal advised tenants on its Web site to file complaints against their landlords for rent overcharges if they think they were affected by the court decision.",0,,,

Months ago, the fallout from the ***recession** barreled through our community. Workers lost jobs permanently, and layoffs also hit those who labor in the public sector. Families have learned to live with less, but worry about what happens if \""less\"" dwindles to \""nothing.\""Perhaps it's because we're often been blinded by lake-effect whiteouts, but Erie people have a tendency to look on the bright side, and to blanket people with help when they are most in need.So today, we acknowledge the many reasons we are grateful to live in Erie.This is a region where two able candidates for Erie County executive promised to conduct a civil campaign, and stuck to it. Perhaps other politicians can glean some inspiration from the way Democrat Barry Grossman and Republican Mike Kerner refused to heap insults on each other.This is a community where citizens may be at odds about federal health-care reform, but where they are quick to thank the doctors, nurses, physical therapists, technicians, aides, nursing home staff and others who care for loved ones at critical times. Sometimes we get letters from people who have pulled through a health crisis. Other times, surviving family members want to thank those who treated an aging parent or spouse with dignity and respect.This is an area where volunteers carry on a tradition to help the needy. Today, the Sisters of St. Joseph, Gannon University and Peter Lyons celebrate the 20th year of providing free Thanksgiving dinners. Others, such as Pio's Restaurant, also serve free turkey and trimmings. These efforts complement the work of Emmaus Ministries, the Erie City Mission, Second Harvest Food Bank, Community of Caring and other local charities that feed the poor year-round and during the holidays.This is a hometown where selflessness trumps selfishness. We think of the GE Transportation workers who took early retirement to save jobs. We think of members of the African American Concerned Clergy who prod officials to make sure there is equal treatment for all in the justice system. We think of those who write to thank strangers for returning lost wallets or changing flat tires, and we think of the note writers themselves, who promise to \""pay it forward.\""This is a place where caring individuals help those who are hurting. We think of a caller from Mercyhurst College who read a letter about someone who couldn't afford to pay a bill for veterinarian care. The caller offered to help the distraught pet lover and was relieved to learn the sick dog had recovered.This is Erie, where an unseasonably mild November lifted our spirits and prepared us for what lies ahead.

City staff will meet with the council in the next few weeks to discuss ways to keep the budget balanced despite the shortfall.The high price of fuel, the ***mortgage crisis** and many other economic struggles are to blame for the decreased revenue, she said.\""It's a whole host of factors,\"" Supler said. \""The revenue just isn't keeping up.\""Finding ways to make up for the shortfall will be challenging but necessary, said Sumner Mayor Dave Enslow.\""It's just like a family,\"" he said. \""At the end of the day, cities and families are better off for having gone through it.\""The city made a 2 percent budget cut to general fund expenditures in March due to lower than anticipated revenues. Cuts related to the city's operations, such as leaving some vacant positions open, reducing travel and training, eliminating overtime and temporary positions.The cuts were one tool to help keep the budget balanced. Annexation into Fire District No. 22 was another money-saving method that voters approved in April.Tools the city has examined in the past include expanding retail, increasing taxes and improving the city's efficiency in terms of printing costs or electricity. Another option council has been hesitant to undertake involves reducing the city's level of service, which could mean cutting back the hours that city hall is open or decreasing police staff.The key is to live within the city's means and learn to get by on what's available, Enslow said.\""It's not going to be easy,\"" he said. \""It's an unpleasant process.

78,4P6V-W350-TX12-N1VT-00000-00.txt,"c(""Jul. 15--The housing malaise that has spread throughout the nation will probably get worse before it gets better, most analysts agree.Home sales in Las Vegas are off by 40 percent, prices are falling and builders have cut back dramatically on new home production in an attempt to reduce standing inventory.Add the subprime lending meltdown to the pot and it leaves millions of Americans at risk of losing their most precious investment. An estimated $1 trillion in adjustable rate mortgages will reset this year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.It's a problem that has hit many housing markets like a brick, particularly areas that had the most rapid run-up in home appreciation. Foreclosure filings are highest in states such as California, Nevada, Florida and Ohio.Is it is bad as everyone says?\""I walked into the office of the title company I use yesterday, and they were down to less than half their normal staff,\"" Robin Camacho of Direct Access Lending said. \""People are losing jobs in this market. We'll see a lot of part-time Realtors and mortgage officers leave the business before the market turns around. Experienced Realtors and mortgage officers are surviving, but those with less knowledge or a small network of contacts are leaving for a more steady paycheck.\""Camacho said there's not much good news in her local market research.\""The number of new listings is down just a bit. That could be a good sign,\"" she said. \""The number of foreclosures and short sales (homes sold for less than what's owed) continues to rise.\""Home Builders Research reported that new home sales through May are down 43.8 percent in Las Vegas from a year ago and resales are off by 34.7 percent. Median new home prices have declined 4.4 percent to $308,874 and existing home prices slipped 3.8 percent to $278,000.Meanwhile, the inventory of homes for sale on the Multiple Listing Service climbed to a record 23,642 in June, with about 40 percent of them sitting vacant.\""It's worse than I thought, considering I wasn't too optimistic in the first place,\"" said Debi Averett of Phoenix-based Housingdoom.com. \""Typically, June is rush hour for Las Vegas, as busy as you'd expect, and it's dead. I blame the subprime mess for most of it.\""A decade ago, roughly 5 percent of mortgage loan originations were subprime. In 2005, the figure jumped to 20 percent. U.S. foreclosure filings surged 90 percent in May from the same month a year ago, according to Irvine, Calif.-based RealtyTrac.A jump in foreclosures at a time of year that traditionally is the busiest for home sales means the slide in prices probably isn't over, RealtyTrac Chief Executive Officer Tony Saccacio said.\""Such strong activity in the midst of the typical spring buying season could foreshadow even higher foreclosure levels later in the year,\"" Saccacio said in his monthly report. That will add to the downward pressure on home prices in many areas, he said.The National Association of Realtors reported a 1.8 percent slide in median home prices in the first quarter as the housing slump enters its second year.Real estate consultant John Burns said home prices in Las Vegas need to drop by 33 percent, or about $100,000, before the market returns to normal conditions. He shows the housing cost-to-income ratio at 50 percent, meaning people spend half their income on housing. Reno is the same.The national average is around 30 percent.Las Vegas' housing market is not yet near the bottom, despite claims from some real estate agents that the worst is behind us, Andrew Pugh of SellFastLV.com said.Pugh said he's uncomfortable making predictions, but if pressed, he'd have to say we're in for at least a couple of rough years ahead.\""The market is still out of balance and rates have gone up a bit too, which won't help demand,\"" he said.\""I have one house for sale right now for $210,000 on a quarter acre in old Henderson and it's been on the market 30 days or so. It's even slower than I expected. It's pretty bad out there.\""Unless you're buying a low-end property, under $250,000, you're better off renting. A $350,000 house in a good neighborhood can be rented for under $1,500 a month. Right now you can't buy much house for $1,500 a month with a fixed-rate loan.\""Home builders have struggled with sales. A blogger on Housingdoom.com reported that Las Vegas-based Signature Homes has given up trying to sell homes in its Town community at Shadow Lane and Alta Drive and is advertising the three-story townhomes for lease. They were originally offered at $250,000 to $280,000.\""We've all been slowing down a bit, but it's been good for us,\"" said Mick Galatio, owner of Desert Wind Homes. \""Buyers are getting a lot more attention from the builders. It was different when things were going so fast. That's the good part of the market right now.\""Galatio, who founded Desert Wind in 1995, said buyers are able to choose from available inventory and move in right away. They're also getting incentives such as appliance packages, free upgrades, lot premiums and some closing costs paid by the builder.Desert Wind was averaging 150 to 200 home sales a year, but Galatio said he's looking at about 100 sales this year. Even during these slow times, the company sells at least a couple of homes every month, sometimes three or four, he said.A recent report from the National Association of Home Builders showed that residential builder sentiment dropped again and is now the worst in 16 years. KB Home, the largest home builder in Las Vegas, laid off 10 percent of its staff last year. Pulte and Pardee have also gone through layoffs, including some key marketing executives.A source in the home building industry said Pardee will build and sell only model homes at its Vista Cielo subdivision and leave the remaining lots unfinished.Both KB and Pardee have stopped building at Providence, the master-planned community by Focus Property Group in northwest Las Vegas, the source said.\""The current slump in the housing market continues to impact home builder perception as evidenced by the drop in the NAHB Housing Market Index in June,\"" Hanley Wood Market Intelligence said in its monthly economic analysis.The index showed that builder confidence reached its lowest levels since February 1991 at a reading of 28. Both new and existing home sales declined in May.Housing starts also fell as builders may be constructing homes at a more cautious pace.However, building permits rose in May, suggesting that activity may pick up slightly in coming months. In Las Vegas, permit activity is down 34.4 percent from a year ago to 7,934, Home Builders Research reported.\""We don't expect to see any substantial uptick in new home sales until resales rebound,\"" Home Builders Research President Dennis Smith said. \""Another key to better sales velocities is what happens in the lending sector and what kind of responses there are to the subprime mess will be vital.\""Houses are still selling, though in fewer numbers than usual, Camacho said. The growing percentage of houses selling for under $269,000 is an indicator that prices are dropping.Home buyers are still spending to their maximum qualification, so they're getting incredible value for their money right now, she said.\""When buyers are confident that they can buy a home and the value won't drop, they will buy,\"" Camacho said.\""In the past few years we had a lot of casual investors buying up second and third homes. These people aren't buying right now. People are still moving to Las Vegas and they're buying homes to live in. They really aren't concerned about fluctuations in value from day to day, knowing prices rise over time.\""Hanley Wood said the main concerns continue to be tighter lending standards from the subprime mortgage fallout, rising yields and higher food and energy costs.Several structural and economic factors have recently slowed subprime growth and increased delinquencies and foreclosures, economists Faten Sabry and Thomas Schopflocher said in a report for NERA Economic Consulting.Some of these factors include the rise in short-term interest rates and the decrease in the rate of home price appreciation. Many cities, including Las Vegas, actually have price declines taking place.Las Vegas ranked among the top four at-risk housing markets in the PMI U.S. Market Risk Index by PMI Mortgage Insurance Co. The others are Phoenix; Riverside, Calif.; and West Palm Beach, Fla.\""If you've followed the media this month, you know that this market has been tapped to be the worst performer in the United States in terms of sales and pricing in 2007,\"" real estate consultant Steve Bottfeld of Marketing Solutions said.\""Thus far, this market is performing at a much higher level than the pundits suggest. What outside observers tend to miss -- and sometimes even local analysts -- is that this market is in the middle of a major transition.

79,4TW1-2MN0-TX12-N0FR-00000-00.txt,"c(""Nov. 7--OAKLANDWith the 10th-highest foreclosure rate in the nation, Oakland has demonstrated that it's in pretty bad shape.The next challenge will be meeting deadlines to prove why the city needs the most help.The Federal Housing and Economic Recovery Act provided nearly $4 billion to state and local governments to buy and rehabilitate foreclosed homes. Of that money, Oakland was allocated $8.2 million. By Dec. 1, it must propose its solutions for helping residents affected by the subprime loan crisis.Oakland also is competing with other cities ranked among the top 10 in foreclo-sures, including Stockton, Bakersfield, Sacramento and Fresno, for a share of the state's pot of money.This year, the California State Department of Housing and Community Development has an additional $145 million it will distribute to areas with the greatest need. The state will give priority to cities with the greatest percentage of foreclosures and the highest percentage of homes financed by subprime loans. Other determining factors will be the escalating rate at which subprime loans are scheduled to reset.So far this year, about 3,800 of the adjustable rate subprime loans in Oakland have reset or been adjusted to a higher interest rate. That number is expected to climb in the next several years as many subprime loans are scheduled to reset. In addition, recent statistics indicate that the foreclosurecrisis is continuing to expand and the adjustable rate mortgage loan resets will not fully peak until 2011.\""It's extremely distressing for me to see the number of houses vacant on the streets,\"" said Beverly Williams, 59, of Oakland. \""This is urgent, and we have to stop people from losing their homes.\""Williams is a leader with the Association of Community Organizing for Reform Now, or ACORN, a community organization that advocates for low- and moderate-income families. The group is working closely with city officials and banks to convert subprime mortgages into conventional loans and get working families back into their homes.In the past three years, about one in four single-family homes in Oakland has experienced a foreclosure filing. According to RealtyTrac, the city to date has nearly 16,000 properties with foreclosure filings.ACORN has teamed up with the Urban Strategies Council, a nonprofit community building and advocacy agency, to restore blighted neighborhoods and redevelop vacant residential properties. Through a community land trust, they plan to purchase and rehabilitate abandoned or foreclosed homes and sell the houses -- but not the land -- at low-interest loans to residents. By maintaining ownership of the land, the land trust could keep the prices of the homes affordable and gain income as a trust from the appreciation of the land.\""This is just one strategy,\"" said Andy Nelson, director of Economic Opportunity Programs at the Urban Strategies Council. \""There is no one size policy fits all. We need to be creative about the use of public funds to fix the problem.\""The federal funds, however, come with strings attached. The money must be used within 18 months of receipt and can only address properties where the foreclosure is completed, and it must have been vacant for at least three months. In addition, a portion of the funds must be used to assist households whose income does not exceed 50 percent of the area median income. For example, the income for a two-person household cannot exceed $34,450.Sean Rogan, deputy director of Oakland's housing and community development, said staff members are \""on track\"" for meeting the federal deadlines. They are currently creating an outline for how the money will be used based on the program requirements. The plan will be submitted to the City Council at the Nov. 18 meeting.Rogan said the goal is to position the city in a way to leverage additional funds from the state to help stabilize the areas hardest hit by the foreclosures. Oakland has 2,000 bank-owned properties, according to DataQuick.In July, foreclosure victims in West and East Oakland organized a \""Foreclosure Reality Tour\"" to highlight the neighborhoods devastated by the housing crisis. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums, Alameda County Supervisor Keith Carson and several officials have taken the tour. Council members Desley Brooks (Eastmont-Seminary) and Larry Reid (Elmhurst-East Oakland) also participated, as their districts are at the epicenter of the foreclosure crisis. According to ACORN, there are more than 150 abandoned homes from 78th to 89th avenues.While Brooks says she thinks the federal money will be put to good use, it simply is not enough. The funds also do not help to keep families from losing their homes.\""This amount won't even begin to make a dent in the problem,\"" she said. \""People are squatting in the (vacant) properties, engaging in illegal conduct in addition to the blight that results due to lack of maintenance. This severely impacts the quality of life in these neighborhoods.\""In the next couple of months, the vacant property ordinance will be coming to the council, Brooks said.This past summer, many ACORN leaders organized to get Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to sign off on SB1137, which requires mortgage lenders to talk with homeowners before foreclosing, gives tenants more time to vacate foreclosed properties and requires owners to maintain foreclosed properties to prevent neighborhood blight. The city also can impose a $1,000-per-day fine on lenders that do not maintain their vacant, foreclosed properties if problems are not fixed within 30 days.Community and city leaders say that stabilizing neighborhoods will take a multilayered strategy as they brace for the upcoming wave of loans that will be resetting. They also hope to finish strong in the race for resources to address the problem.\""We will keep advocating for remedies to keep families in their home,\"" Brooks said.Reach Kamika Dunlap at 510-208-6448 or kdunlap@bayareanewsgroup.comTo see more of The Oakland Tribune or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.insidebayarea.com/oaklandtribune/.

There's no good time to announce something like this.\""Before the layoff, the plant had 235 employees and 128 contract workers.Six of the permanent layoffs involve salaried employees, Faulkner said. Eleven of the temporary layoffs are salaried.The company previously announced it \""is exploring strategic alternatives\"" for the nylon business, including its sale. It has said it would dispose of the business by the end of March.Faulkner and other managers met with laid-off employees individually or in small groups Friday, Faulkner said.\""The employees are very understanding,\"" Faulkner said. \""We have very bright employees, and they see what's in the news and what's going on in the worldwide economy. They are aware and educated enough to know that things like this happen when the economy goes bad.\""The permanent job losses are part of Solutia's effort to restructure the unprofitable nylon business. The company cut 10 percent, or $40 million, of its annualized fixed costs across the nylon business.The temporary layoffs are a response to a dramatic drop in demand for nylon that began in late September.The Decatur facility produces an intermediate chemical used in nylon fiber and nylon plastic. Most of the fiber goes into carpet. That part of the business has been dropping for years, especially since housing sales began to drop in late 2006.The nylon plastics business, however, had been growing until the national ***economic crisis** became acute. Much of the nylon plastic is used for under-the-hood parts in new cars. Car manufacturers have cut production in response to plummeting sales.\""In September, we were, by and large, running our nylon plants flat-out,\"" said Jenkins. \""At that time our forecast for the fourth quarter was for continued strong demand. As a result, we had pretty significant inventory built up. In the last six weeks or so, that demand has gone down significantly.\""Faulkner said Solutia is selling from inventory, which he believes will run out -- requiring more production -- in early 2009.\""The precipitous decline has flattened,\"" Faulkner said. \""We're feeling as though we're reaching the lowest ebb of customer orders. We anticipate that will slowly start to climb. I believe the economy will begin to rebound, and we'll begin a sustained recovery, in 2009.\""If Solutia's sales projections are overly optimistic, the anticipated duration of the furlough for temporarily laid off employees could change.\""While we believe it is temporary and they will be brought back,\"" Jenkins said, \""if that situation were to change we would communicate to them.\""Solutia is paying severance to permanently laid-off employees. The temporarily laid-off employees can continue their benefits, but their only wage continuation will be through unemployment compensation.The maximum weekly unemployment compensation in the state is $255, with a maximum duration of 39 weeks.Solutia entered a reorganization bankruptcy in 2003. It shut down its Acrilan plant in Decatur in April 2005, laying off two-thirds of its employees.Solutia exited bankruptcy in February after litigation over $1.2 billion in exit financing. To keep the financing, it had to agree to higher than expected interest rates.In July, Solutia announced it wanted to sell the nylon business.Overall, Solutia laid off 1,600 workers Friday. About 60 percent of the affected workers are contractors.

In the past year, the state has had to cut $2.1 billion of transportation projects as revenues lagged, and is looking to come up with another $300 million in operational savings.\""The economy has had a severe impact,\"" Henson said.Although some efforts have been made to boost transportation funding in recent years, the revenue streams that pay for paving state roads and upgrading public transit, such as the gas tax and titling tax, have been sluggish.Also, as the state grapples with budget deficits, pockets of transportation money have been raided to fill the gaps. For example, Anne Arundel County has lost $9.3 million, or 90 percent, of its highway user revenue for this year.\""We are going to have to make do with what we have,\"" said state Sen. Ed DeGrange, D-Glen Burnie, chairman of the Senate's transportation subcommittee. \""You would like to have more, but I think under the restraints, we are doing about as well as can be expected.\""In terms of state-maintained highways, the most significant project for Anne Arundel is widening a portion of Baltimore-Washington Parkway between Interstates 695 and 195. Almost $8 million will be spent to construct an additional two lanes.Planning studies are being done for possible improvements to Route 175 and Route 198 near Fort George G. Meade, as those roads will be heavily impacted by the anticipated influx of people from the Base Realignment and Closure process, or BRAC. Another $32.4 million has been set aside for intersection improvements near the base.\""Right now, that is what you are going to see,\"" DeGrange said. \""Certainly there is not the money other than to do some intersection improvements.\""Other projects include $2.3 million to replace a bridge deck on Ridge Road.One recent bright spot has been the federal stimulus program, which has accounted for almost $23 million for state and local roads in Anne Arundel and millions more for transit projects, such as new buses and light rail improvements.The stimulus \""clearly couldn't have come at a better time,\"" Henson said. \""We really have been working hard to get every dollar we could.\""The state has applied for federal grants that could contribute another $58 million for BRAC intersection improvements and $25 million for a central Maryland transit facility.New money is desperately needed for BRAC preparation, according to a federal report issued in September. The U.S. Government Accountability Office found six intersection improvements near Fort Meade will need another $65 million to $100 million for completion.Whether that money will be available, however, is uncertain. The General Assembly will continue to face the temptation to raid transportation dollars to cover deficits in other parts of the budget, DeGrange said.\""Taking funds from transportation ... is also dangerous because (infrastructure money) creates jobs,\"" he said. \""It is not going to be a pleasant time.\""To see more of The Capital or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.hometownannapolis.com.

We're behind, but not behind so significantly that we don't think we'll hit our budgeted targets,"" Senior Vice President for Planning &amp; Development and Secretary of the College Bill Torrey said.Total giving, which Torrey said ""includes gifts for endowment, building projects, and other fund-raising objectives here at Bowdoin,"" is down 10 percent compared to a year ago. On December 31, 2007, total giving amounted to $29,160,250, while on December 31, 2008, the number was at $26,240,566-a difference of $2,919,684.Total annual giving, which includes gifts to the Alumni Fund, Parents Fund, Polar Bear Athletic Fund, and Friends of the College Fund, is down 12 percent. Annual giving was at $4,746,922 on Dec 31, 2007, and only stood at $4,195,747 on Dec 31, 2008-a difference of $551,175.However, despite falling short relative to a year ago, Torrey said it doesn't imply that ""we won't necessarily hit our budgeted target for annual giving.""The College has budgeted an annual giving target of $7,475,000 for the 2009 fiscal year, according to Senior Vice President for Finance and Administration &amp; Treasurer Katy Longley. This amount supports six percent of the College's operating expenses, which are around $125,000,000.Dean of Student Affairs Tim Foster said that this annual giving is ""critical,"" due to the fact that ""those gifts go directly into the operating budget.""The budgeted target is lower than the actual fund-raising goal set, in order to ""be conservative and give us some flexibility,"" Torrey said. Thus, he said, if trends in giving continue, the sum may fall short of the fund-raising goal, but still meet its budgeted target.""As long as we hit our unrestricted giving budgeting number, we will cover our operating costs, and we will fund the things we have in our budget-financial aid, salaries, and everything else,"" said TorreyAccording to the Bowdoin Campaign Web site, funds from annual giving create ""vital support for the College's academic program, financial aid, and extracurricular activities, providing an important margin of excellence beyond what is possible from tuition and endowment income alone.""Torrey also commented on the status of the Campaign, a five-year operation running from July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2009, stating that the College, as of December 31, 2008, is at $243,500,000 in commitments towards the $250,000,000 goal.""We expect to hit our goal...The campaign is on track to be the most successful Bowdoin's had. It has helped to transform the place and greatly strengthen it,"" he said.Acknowledging economic hardship, Torrey said fund-raising is harder now as ""people are hurting,"" but that the College is working hard to maintain annual giving. Torrey said he hasn't felt the need to stimulate giving with more desperate pleas yet.""We've tended to make our appeals similar to what we've always done, appealing to people's highest aspirations for the College, not pushing a panic button. We've felt that at this point in time, that's the best way to ask Bowdoin alumni for support. You can only push the panic button once, and at this point in time, we don't need to do,"" he said.Therefore, Torrey said he is committed to the fund-raising goals of the College.""We want to keep the place where it is academically, we want to maintain financial aid where it is for today's students, we want to maintain the upkeep and quality of buildings we build, and in order for those things to happen, we need support. But we also realize that it is very difficult, and in terms of very large commitments, people may not be ready at this point,"" he said.Torrey observed that it's difficult to secure large gifts of $100,000 or more, as they tend to involve gifts of people's capital and appreciated securities. He said the College has seen fewer ""planned gifts,"" typically gift annuities or the creation of charitable trusts, because they are complicated, involve tax issues, and require asset appreciation, which isn't happening today.""You tend to see smaller gifts, cash gifts of checks or credit cards, and fewer gifts of appreciated securities,"" he said. While capital gifts are harder to obtain, people are ""not falling significantly behind in the commitments they've made to the College,"" through pledges or annual gifts, he added.Executive Director of Alumni Relations and Annual Giving Eric Foushee said that with the economy as it is, a decrease in annual giving from alumni is to be expected.""In short, yes, with the ***economic downturn** we were bracing for a difficult year. I will say that...all the NESCAC schools and our comparison schools are tracking relatively the same...We're pretty consistent with most of the schools,"" he said.However, Foushee said that he's not hearing many alumni say they have to suspend their annual gift because of their financial situation; rather, they are adjusting their pledges or gifts to scale back.He added that ""Bowdoin alums are fiercely loyal to the place,"" and although annual giving is down by 12 percent in comparison to a year ago, there have been about 300 more donors so far. He said he is encouraged by the additional donors making pledges for later gifts, noting that in today's economy, people just want to hold on to their cash as long as possible.Looking ahead with these economic conditions in consideration, the College's financial planning model, used in President Barry Mills' memo to the College community, budgets annual giving to remain at its current level in the 2010 fiscal year, with modest increases in the following years.Provided that the budget has traditionally accounted for a two or three percent increase in giving each year, Foushee said the model's plan for growth sounds realistic. He said he anticipates a tougher year next year, thereby justifying a zero percent increase in annual giving, before returning to times of growth.At this point, however, Torrey said that, all things considered, ""we're lucky to be where we are.""""I think the College has been really responsible in terms of its financial planning, and that's paying off for us now. We've got a great president, he's done what he needed to do to prepare for the good times and the bad,"" said Torrey.

""I pinch myself still,"" he told the Deseret News. ""I can't believe it happened."" The Adamses are beneficiaries of a U.S. Small Business Administration effort funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The program appropriated $730 million dollars in funding to the agency, aimed at expanding access to investment capital for small businesses nationwide. The Recovery Act contains tax breaks, market enhancements and strong lending programs, which help foster job creation and restart lending to small businesses, according to the Recovery.gov Web site. The SBA plan temporarily eliminates loan fees and increases loan guarantees, agency administrator Karen Mills said. Mills spoke at a news conference at Midtown Manor on Thursday. The nursing home provides long-term care for just over 70 patients, most of whom are veterans, Mills said.  Locally, SBA programs have aided approximately 1,900 small businesses since last October, according to Stan Nakano, SBA district director in Utah. ""The state has a very pro-business climate,"" he said. ""If the lender is willing to make the loan, we can now guarantee up to 90 percent of these loans."" In addition to increasing start-up funding capital, the SBA also implemented the America's Recovery Capital loan program to assist existing, otherwise profitable small businesses that are adversely affected by the ***economic downturn**, Hayley Matz, SBA press secretary, told the Deseret News.

Cramer also had to explain old video clips of himself explaining techniques through which high-rolling hedge fund managers - like Cramer used to be - legally but unethically manipulate prices.Just as it takes a village to raise a child, sometimes it takes a comedian to let the emperors of Wall Street journalism know when their clothes are in tatters.I was only troubled by the way the half-hour battering of Cramer made him look almost like a fall guy for the entire global financial mess. He's more of a symptom of an underlying media pathology. The problem here is not individuals but attitudes, including a media culture that causes some people, particularly in the entertainment-driven medium of television, to blur the line between entertainment, good journalism and sound analysis.Media need to cover the world of business and finance as aggressively as we are expected to cover politics and government. Instead, some financial shows are going the way of high-energy political talk shows: Asking for sound judgment is like calling for prudence in a mud-wrestling arena. In hindsight, we can look back and see the hard-working journalists who saw early signs of today's financial storm gathering like a hurricane off the coast of Florida. But it was hard for the cautious voices to get much of a hearing.As long as everyone was making money, nobody wanted to hear the bad news. Now that the bad news is upon us, everyone is pointing fingers of blame every which way - even at the ""Mad Money"" man. He's an easy target, but hardly the only deserving one.Clarence Page writes for the Chicago Tribune. E-mail address: cpage@tribune .com.",1,,,

Barney Frank, D-Mass, committee staff said yesterday.The hearing, which was to be held March 5, will be rescheduled for the following week or sometime after Congress' subsequent three-week recess, the staff said.Committee aides said the committee is interested in what Congress can do, if anything, to help cities and counties access the capital markets, particularly in light of the downgrades to the monoline bond insurers and the problems they are having with auction-rate securities. Staff said the committee is particularly interested in hearing from issuers.The hearing will be the first to specifically address municipal bonds since at least 1993, a market participant said.A statement released last week indicated that the committee is also concerned about the impact to the economy if states and localities have to eliminate or scale back on projects and services.""It is now clear that state and local governments have become the innocent victims of the credit crisis and they are being unfairly punished for market conditions far beyond their control,"" Frank said in a statement. ""Cities and states may now be forced to pull back or significantly decrease infrastructure investments and other vital services, which is the wrong thing economically and will leave shortfalls in this critical area.""Though groups representing issuers such as the Government Finance Officers Association have welcomed the hearing, the committee had not yet announced which issuers it has invited to speak.http://www.bondbuyer.com/            http://www.sourcemedia.com/",1,,,

Called ""Toasty Torpedoes,"" the item is the latest move by Quiznos to add lower-priced sandwiches to its menu. The chain also launched an ad campaign earlier this year to promote its 20 subs for less than $5.""Quiznos and Subway and the industry overall are really trying to reach out to consumers from a price point standpoint,"" said Valerie Killifer, senior editor of FastCasual.com, an industry publication. ""We're seeing a lot of chains create value meals and deals they might not have otherwise. ""Subway's foot-longs, which were reduced in price to $5 last year, come in more than 20 variations and have helped contribute to the chain's 17.1 percent sales growth in 2008, according to the Chicago-based consulting firm Technomic Inc. The fast-food chain moved into the No. 2 slot behind McDonald's in a list of the country's largest restaurant chains with $9.6 billion in sales last year.""Subway's got a stranglehold on the market and is miles ahead of Quiznos at this point,"" said Steve West, a restaurant analyst for Stifel Nicolaus.West expressed skepticism at how much of an impact Quiznos' moves would have on taking part of Subway's market share.""They went at the price point last year when they introduced the $2 Sammies,"" he said, referring to Quiznos' reduced calorie flatbread sandwiches. ""That didn't seem to impact [demand for] Subway and its healthy menu, and I don't see the Toasty Torpedo competing directly with the $5 foot-long either. ""At the Subway on Calvert Street in downtown Baltimore, attorneys Terese Brown and Hasson Barnes said they eat lunch there a few times a month and despite the ad campaigns, they still thought they'd spend more if they switched to Quiznos.""Plus, it's the whole habit thing,"" said Brown. ""I'm used to going to Subway. ""But Barnes, who said he always gets the same sandwich, said he might be swayed: ""If it was actually cheaper in terms of the dollars and the amount of food you get, I'd go next door to Quiznos. Tuna is tuna, so I'm not going to spend more than I have to. ""The good news for Quiznos is, there are plenty of customers to go around, and it stands to gain new business from last year's growth in quick-service restaurants due to the ***recession** and increased demand for cheaper meals on the go.According to Technomic, eight of the top 10 fastest-growing restaurant chains are fast casual restaurants including Chipotle, Potbelly Sandwich Works, Five Guys Burgers and Fries and Noodles &amp; Company. The top 10 chains combined for sales of $4.9 billion in 2008, a 24 percent increase over 2007.Quiznos' numbers simply don't compare at the top, but it is making the right moves to cater to what consumers want during trying times, one analyst said.""The problem is Subway has very large unit base - you can't throw a stone without hitting a Subway - and the convenience factor will always be in Subway's favor,"" said Dean Haskell, of Denver-based National Retail Concept Partners. ""I see [Quiznos] gaining but don't see them passing. ""But this economic climate could be the chain's best chance to gain in that share, noted Killifer.""The sandwich chain market is not saturated right now,"" she said.

90,4TDM-K660-TX12-N167-00000-00.txt,"c(""Sep. 10--UNCASVILLE, Conn. -- After a traditional smudging and prayer by Mohegan Chairman Bruce \""Two Dogs\"" Bozsum and a few short speeches, the Mohegan Tribe introduced its newest addition to the gaming world -- the Casino of the Wind -- with pounding drums, flashing lights, and the dramatic unveiling of a 100-foot-long curtain that covered the casino entrance.A huge crowd including tribal and elder council members, business people, local elected officials and other dignitaries, and the media gathered Aug. 29 for the official opening of the Casino of the Wind, the third elementally-themed casino to be added to the tribe's monumentally successful Mohegan Sun Casino.\""Today we're all before you, Creator, giving thanks for all the good thing's you've given us. We thank you for this beautiful day. We give thanks for all the good things that will come,\"" Bozsum said.The opening of the Casino of the Wind marked the completion of the first phase of Mohegan's ambitious $925 million expansion plan, called Project Horizon. The development, which is expected to be completed in 2010, will add a 39-story hotel with 261 House of Blues-themed rooms, a House of Blues Music Hall, restaurant and exclusive members-only House of Blues Foundation Room, and additional retail and restaurant space.The Casino of the Wind is the Mohegan Sun's second gaming expansion in the 13 years since it opened the Casino of the Earth. The addition came in under budget by almost $9 million less than its original $125 million estimate, and ahead of schedule.\""Today we begin a new phase of Mohegan Sun's continuing growth as one of the premier gaming and entertainment destinations in the world,\"" Bozsum said. \""Following in the footsteps of Casino of the Earth and Casino of the Sky, the Rockwell Group again utilized our tribal traditions in their design and conception for the new Casino of the Wind.\""Bozsum thanked the councils, planning team, the supportive local communities, and employees, who he called \""members of our Mohegan family.\"" He also lavished praise on the Mohegan Sun's patrons \""who make all of this possible.\""\""Anybody ready to play some poker at Mohegan Sun?\"" Mohegan President and CEO Mitchell Etess asked moments before the veil was pulled off and hundreds of guests and patrons surged into the new casino where table dealers stood ready to greet their first customers.The 64,000-square-foot Casino of the Wind has 45,000 square feet of new gaming space and is aimed at poker players of all levels. The space features a 42-table poker room with a semi-private high-level area featuring seven high-limit tables. Almost two dozen televisions broadcasting a variety of programs are suspended around the poker room.The new casino marks the return of poker to the Mohegan Sun after a five year hiatus. Just after the Mohegan Sun closed its poker games in 2003, poker exploded on the national scene with the World Poker Tournament and a following as dedicated as sports fans. Foxwoods Resort Casino just 10 miles down the road and Mohegan's biggest competitor has been the only poker game in town during the past five years. Now the Mohegan Sun will be able to attract poker players to its facility.Foxwoods recently underwent its own expansion with the completion of the new MGM Grand at Foxwoods, a $700 million project that opened in May.The new Casino of the Wind also offers more than 650 new slot machines and 28 table games.Hundreds of regular patrons showed up for the opening of the Casino of the Wind and a large line formed at the sign up desk for the poker tables.Among the regulars was Bruce Harding from Westbrook, Mass. Harding said he comes to the Sun every week and only plays blackjack. He said he and his wife used to go to Las Vegas every year but the downturn in the economy has made that impossible.\""This is cheaper. We're retired. It's the only thing we do that doesn't cost money because we win more than we lose,\"" Harding said.The casino's design is meant to interpret traditional Native themes including the spirit of the four winds. But one of the most spectacular constructions features water; It's a 35-foot-high by 50-foot wide water wall of granite that acts as a projection screen for a constantly changing shimmering array of lights, colors and shapes.The Casino of the Wind welcomed back the Chief's Deli, a quick service restaurant, after a two-year absence. A Jimmy Buffet Margaritaville Restaurant will open in October.A month long celebration of the new casino is planned for October. The festivities will include a poker tournament with one of the largest guaranteed prize pools on the east coast, daily car giveaways, and celebrity entertainment in Mohegan Sun's 10,000-seat arena.The new addition has created 350 new permanent jobs and provided more than 850 construction jobs. A total of 1,500 jobs will be added when the entire Project Horizon is completed.The tribe is moving forward with a hugely expensive expansion while the economy is gloomy and slot revenues have dropped over the past several months, but Bozsum was positive about the future.\""It says we'll be ready when the economy changes, when things come back, which they will soon enough. We're open and we're ready to go,\"" Bozsum said.With a Casino of the Earth, a Casino of the Sky, and now a Casino of the Wind, is the tribe's next expansion going to be a Casino of the Water?\""We haven't discussed that yet, but that's a good thought,\"" Bozsum said.To see more of Indian Country Today, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.indiancountry.com.

She said a long-running dispute between the city and APCO prevented her from being objective.Councilman Stavros Anthony voted no, saying the city had other priorities.\""I don't believe we should be spending $11 million on a museum right now,\"" Anthony said. \""It's my belief that we should put this project on hold until the economy comes around.\""Flagship voiced a number of complaints about APCO's bid, saying the contractor didn't have the qualifications to do the job, had not performed satisfactorily in the past and didn't disclose its legal entanglements, including a contract dispute with Las Vegas over courts at the Amanda and Stacy Darling Memorial Tennis Center.\""This process has been flawed from the start,\"" Ferrario said, noting that Flagship was the low bidder in an earlier set of bids that were thrown out, improperly, he contended, as not meeting specifications.City staff reviewed the complaints Ferrario submitted and found them to be without merit, City Attorney Brad Jerbic said.And it's not a secret that Las Vegas and APCO are in arbitration.The matter has been discussed at council meetings, and Jerbic noted that the city has spent $2.7 million in legal fees. APCO also has received other city contracts since the arbitration started and performed well, he said.Overall, the museum is expected to cost $50 million, funded mostly from city Redevelopment Agency bonds used to boost downtown development. There also are grants and private donations in the mix.It was scheduled to open in 2010, but with litigation, that could be delayed.Mayor Pro Tem Gary Reese said bids on public contracts are being scrutinized more now because of the lack of other construction work caused by the ***economic slowdown**, which makes moving forward with the project even more important.\""To further our redevelopment of downtown, we have projects like this,\"" he said. \""If we don't support them, then we're not doing our job.\""To see more of the Las Vegas Review-Journal, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.lvrj.com.

92,7V49-FPF1-2PGD-715S-00000-00.txt,"c("" Tight times carve space for big opportunities "", ""However dreary the economic forecast, Tiffany Pernell is betting St. Louisians will always find a little money to party.That's the crux of Pernell's business philosophy as she and her partner, Tracy Norfleet, push forward with plans to open their first business - an upscale spa and party place for girls. Even as consumers dramatically cut spending on nonessentials, Pernell is confident the company, Pretty n Posh Spa, Parties and Accessories, will be a hit.\""You would be amazed how much people will spend on their kid's birthday,\"" said Pernell, 32, who sought counseling from a local business incubator.It might seem a little daring to begin an entrepreneurial venture in a period when even well-established companies are folding, but business incubators in the area are reporting an increase in residents looking for help as they set out on their own.Small businesses, those with 500 or fewer workers, employ about half of private-sector workers in the United States, and their success or failure plays a pivotal role in the economy. That means a growing number of small businesses is good for the area, even when times are bad, said Dennis Breite, vice president of St. Louis Enterprise Centers, which operates four of about a dozen business incubators in the metro area.\""Their success is the region's success,\"" he said.It's not unusual to see a boost in business startups as large numbers of employees are laid off, Breite said. The sudden loss of a job gives potential entrepreneurs the push they need to get started, and business incubators are there to help them in the early stages of the process by providing individualized counseling, training and work space.Craig Frahm, chief financial officer at the Economic Development Center of St. Charles County, said the business incubator had seen a significant bump in interest in the past few months. The center's two locations, in St. Charles and St. Peters, now house 43 burgeoning companies, which puts the incubator at about 90 percent capacity. And prospective tenants continue to inquire.\""I've been doing three tours a day as opposed to three a week,\"" Frahm said.The rising interest in start-ups wasn't entirely unexpected - incubators tend to get busier in a bad economy, and vice versa. \""When things are really good in the economy, incubation is not all that great,\"" Frahm said.'An exceptional time'In fact, a slumping economy is actually an almost ideal environment for the recently downsized to get to work on the business ideas they've been wistfully mulling over for years, said Alan Hauff, director of the Small Business and Technology Development Center at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.Hauff has counseled a large number of new clients who have told him they chose to go into business for themselves after being laid off at larger companies, such as Anheuser-Busch.\""Now is kind of an exceptional time,\"" he said. Prices are low for many supplies, Hauff said, and the tide of companies leaving the market means there is room for others to move in. Pernell sees the same sort of opportunities in the work force, noting that the search for qualified employees for Pretty n Posh should be relatively easy considering how many people are looking for a job.\""If we were open, it would be great because we would have so many potential employees,\"" she said.Still, starting a business in a ***recession** can be challenging.Pretty n Posh, for example, would be in business already except for the fact that Pernell and her partner have run into an issue that has tripped up many entrepreneurs recently: They can't get a loan.The two figured they would need about $80,000 in startup money, an amount they settled on after it became clear their original $160,000 estimate was far more than they thought any bank would loan them. The loaned cash would pay for rent, employee salaries, furniture, a sound system, limousine and other supplies. They hope to use work space at St. Louis Enterprise Centers, which has been advising them.Pernell and Norfleet have approached three banks in recent months, and each has given them the same advice.\""The banks have told us, 'You have a great idea, but maybe you should just wait a year,'\"" Pernell said.Ron Mueller has seen this sort of problem a lot recently. Mueller, a site director of the Small Business Development Center in St. Charles, advises people who are in the early stages of developing a business.\""Right now banks are not wanting to do loans to startup businesses,\"" he said. \""It's very tough unless they've got some collateral.\""Business incubators can provide wannabe entrepreneurs with help through counseling and office space, but getting a loan in a credit crunch is no easy maneuver.One of the ways Mueller said he advised clients was by pointing to the difficulties they might incur while operating their businesses. It's a good time for people with good ideas to get started, he said, but every idea should be carefully examined.\""What we do is, we ask the hard questions that need to be answered,\"" he said.Pernell, of Florissant, has been saving money for her new venture, but she and her partner won't have enough cash to open unless they find a bank willing to make the loan or an angel investor who will put up the capital. They have already spent a few thousand dollars for startup expenses such as attorney fees.Regardless, Pernell said, she's optimistic the venture will take off soon. On the bright side, she added, the ***recession** has forced her to look more carefully at ways to be more efficient.\""You learn how to cut back,\"" she said. \""You learn how to deal with things.\""---area incubators- St. Louis EnterpriseCentersFour locations, in midtown St. Louis, Chesterfield, Wellston, and Lemay314-534-1818- Economic Development Center of St. Charles CountyTwo locations, in St. Charles and St. Peters636-441-6880- St. Patrick Center's BEGIN New Venture CenterSt. Louis314-802-0696- Habitat for Neighborhood Business Inc.Two locations - affiliated with St. Louis University314-977-3850- Small Business &amp; Technology Development CenterUniversity of Missouri-St. Louis314-516-6121- The Center for Emerging TechnologiesCentral West End314-615-6900- Nidus Center for Scientific EnterpriseCreve Coeur314-812-8000- Technology Entrepreneur CenterSt. Louis314-436-3500- River's Edge Enterprise CenterGranite City618-877-8444""

93,4S85-CBR0-TX12-N1P7-00000-00.txt,"c(""Apr. 10--CAMBRIDGE -- Lowell's Hamilton Canal District is on the short list of areas to be targeted by Gov. Deval Patrick for economic development, a designation that could put the weight of the state behind recruiting businesses to the city.Patrick, in his much-hyped speech on the state of the Massachusetts economy yesterday, said he plans to create 16 \""regional growth districts\"" that would function like the former Fort Devens with streamlined state permitting that the state would market to potential new companies.The administration has already announced zones in Worcester and Haverhill as the first two growth districts, but administration sources told The Sun that Lowell's Hamilton Canal District, a revitalization project in the downtown area between Jackson, Appleton and Middlesex streets, is likely to be included in the governor's plan.\""I foresee the Hamilton Canal District, with its 15 acres and all its commercial potential, being a great candidate,\"" said George Ramirez, general counsel in the Executive Office of Economic Development and a former Lowell city councilor.The governor's office would only say that Lowell is a \""likely candidate.\""Businesses looking to locate in growth districts would be put on the fast track for state environmental and building permits, and the state would help cities and towns expedite the local permitting process to lure businesses and jobs.As it does with Devens, state agencies would also assist withmarketing and help to steer companies interested in locating in Massachusetts to one of the 16 districts.\""That would be huge for us if we can get that designation,\"" said City Manager Bernie Lynch, adding that officials plan to start moving full-steam ahead on the Hamilton Canal District by the end of the summer.An announcement on the district is expected to come within the next 30 days, Ramirez said.\""It really is about time to take that Devens concept and replicate it throughout the state, because it works,\"" said Robert Halpin, executive director of the Merrimack Valley Economic Development Council.The state has been successful in luring many business to Devens, including Bristol-Myers Squibb and Evergreen Solar, with projects that created thousands of new jobs.Patrick, delivering his speech on the campus of MIT, sought to ease fears over the downturn in the national economy, remarking several times that he senses the public's \""anxiety.\""\""People are anxious and we need to pay attention to that,\"" Patrick said.\""State government has its limitations, but it has its responsibilities as well,\"" he added.To that end, the governor said he would file legislation requesting $3.8 billion in new borrowing to repair 411 deteriorating bridges in the commonwealth over the next eight years, a sped-up schedule that would put people to work immediately, creating 10,000 to 15,000 new construction jobs.By taking on additional debt now, administration officials said they could jump-start the economy in the short term, and would lower the state's transportation bonding cap in future years to keep state debt under the current borrowing limits.House Speaker Sal DiMasi, Senate President Therese Murray and state Treasurer Tim Cahill have endorsed the plan.\""There would be 900 structurally deficient bridges by the end of my second term under the current schedule,\"" Patrick said, drawing laughter from the audience with the suggestion that he plans to still be in office six years from now.Two state-owned bridges in Lowell, including one over the Merrimack River and another over Interstate 495, are on the list for repairs, MassHighway spokesman Adam Hurtubise said. He could not immediately provide exact locations of the bridges.Patrick painted an optimistic picture of the state's economy, arguing that despite job losses in retail, construction and manufacturing, the growth of the life-science, biomanufacturing and clean-energy industries have kept Massachusetts moving forward.He pointed to companies like Evergreen Solar, which this week announced an expansion in the construction of its new Devens facility that would triple the company's work force in Massachusetts with 700 new jobs.Unlike the past two national ***recession**s that have hit Massachusetts harder than other states, the governor said the state is well-positioned to weather the storm, but not immune to slumping housing markets, foreclosures and job losses.He said he plans to authorize the release of $20 million in local infrastructure grants and $18 million for work-force training programs over the net 90 days. The state will also loan $20 million to nonprofit developers to help buy and rehabilitate foreclosed properties in the state's largest cities.Republicans jumped on the speech as an opportunity to criticize the governor's tax plan to be taken up by the Legislature tomorrow. The plan would raise revenue by hiking the cigarette tax by $1 and closing corporate tax loopholes to generate almost $300 million.Patrick and DiMasi have both proposed an accompanying reduction in the corporate excise tax, but the speaker has offered a bigger tax break for mostly small businesses.To see more of The Sun, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.lowellsun.com.

OPEC has struggled to stop the free-fall in prices, which are now off more than $110 from the peak this summer.Oil prices surged too high last summer and are now heading to the other extreme, said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. The cut in oil production will eventually help deplete inventory and set the stage for another eventual spike in oil prices, he said. ""It has nothing to do with market fundamentals anymore,"" Gheit said.Prices may also be under pressure because today is the last day to trade on the January oil contract, adding some volatility. Oil prices for future contracts were higher but also fell yesterday.""It's going to take an uptick in global oil demand to push oil prices higher,"" said Nicholas S.  Hayman, a senior trader at LaSalle Futures in Chicago.Plunging prices pulled down energy stocks, including Exxon and Chevron, which were down 5 percent.Meanwhile, investor concerns about the severity of the country's ***recession** were also reinforced yesterday by a Labor Department report showing that a seasonally adjusted 554,000 people filed for initial jobless claims last week. That was 21,000 fewer claims than the previous week, but high by historical standards. Many economists now think the country's unemployment rate, which hit 6.7 percent last month, could reach 8 percent by the end of the year.General Motors and Ford also tumbled yesterday after President Bush said an ""orderly"" bankruptcy might be the best way to handle the struggling U.S. auto industry. Detroit's Big Three automakers have been waiting for the Bush administration to announce plans for an industry bailout since the Senate voted down an emergency loan package.General Motors, with  the biggest losses on the Dow, fell 16.3 percent to $3.66 a share, while Ford slid 9.6 percent to $2.84.

Besides, the tension in Wall Street because of the crisis in the high-risk mortgage sector in the U.S. continues to influence the analysts, who are still concerned about the next corporate reports. Last week, the banks Merrill Lynch, Citigroupand Wachovia reported losses above expectations. This morning, the news was that HSBC will be the next to announce losses because of its exposition to high-risk credit.In the stock market, petroleum prices in New York fell over $2US during the day, throwing down the shares of oil companies worldwide and also in Brazil. The São Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa) fell sharply today pushed by shares of companies of the oil, steel and bank sectors. The Brazilian exchange dipped 4.34% today to 61,527 points, the lowest level since October 22. The financial volume closed at $6R.51 billion.On the Brazilian Mercantile and Futures Exchange (BM&amp;F) business volume was low today. The projections of interest rates on long-term Interfinancial Deposit (DI) contracts traded on the Brazilian Mercantile &amp; Futures Exchange (BM&amp;F) closed upward, reflecting the events abroad. The contracts maturing January 2010, the most traded, were negotiated at 11.95% against 11.82% Friday, with 173,700 operations.Exchange rates operated under pressure between a maximum of $1R.779 and minimum of $1R.757, closing up 1.83% at $1R.777. © 2007 NoticiasFinancieras - InvestNews - All rights reserved",1,,,
97,4TJV-3YJ0-TWDH-R0JX-00000-00.txt,"The QTI Group is a privately held staffing, recruiting, consulting and human resources outsourcing company based in Madison.Founded in 1957 as a franchise of the Manpower employment agency, ownership of the company changed in 1978 and it became Qualitemps.In 1999 the company evolved into the QTI Group when it began offering recruiting, consulting and human resources services in addition to its longstanding staffing services.Londa J. Dewey became president of the company in November after working for 25 years at U.S. Bank and its predecessor organizations, most recently as president of the Private Client Group and market president of U.S. Bank Madison.The QTI Group has 11 branches in Wisconsin and fills more than 11,000 temporary, temp-to-hire and direct-hire positions per year.Q: What trends have you noticed in the staffing and human resources industries?A: This is a really exciting time to be in this business, for multiple reasons. One trend is more of a tendency towards outsourcing. Companies want to do what their core business is and then surround themselves with experts in different aspects of their business - human resources, recruiting. Specialization would be a good way to say it.Another trend is toward a flexible work force. Especially if a company is uncertain about where the economy is going, and they have a project, they may want to hire temporary folks to do that project instead of hiring people that they would make a long-term commitment to when they don't know where they're going to go after that project. So the flexibility is something that we're seeing, and that might be driven economically.The demographic wave is another huge trend. Sixty-six percent of corporate executives are going to retire in the next 10 years. ... Then you add in the people in middle management who have been at companies for 25 to 30 years who are also going to be retiring. With the aging baby boomers, a lot of people are going to be retiring and a lot of knowledge and experience about their business is going to go with them.So from the perspective of our consulting business, we're starting to get some requests from companies who are asking how do we plan for this? What do we do from a transition and succession-planning perspective? How do we develop people who are current employees so they can be prepared to take on these responsibilities? How do we recruit if we don't have somebody on the bench who can take on those responsibilities? ... We're starting to hear more about it and get more requests about it. So we can be right in the middle of that trend and be really helpful to companies who have these changes coming. ...Baby boomers are going to redefine what it means to retire. ... Sometimes people want to come back to work, but they don't necessarily want to come back to the same career they were in before. We can help them with that, too. So we're connecting with a different applicant pool than we have in the past - the newly retired who want to work part time, or want to do something different from what they did before. That's another wave.Q: What are the effects of the slumping national economy on QTI?A: Well, fortunately we're in a great place in southern Wisconsin. Our unemployment rate is still very low. So from that perspective, we've seen some companies that are slowing down and some that are incredibly busy. I would say overall our company is not seeing a slowdown. There are pockets of slowdowns, but then there are pockets that are going strong.Typically, if a business is going to reduce their staff, the first people they are going to let go are their temporary employees. Likewise, when they start doing better, the first people they're going to hire are temporary employees, just to see if it's going to stick.Q: Who are QTI's client companies and what are they typically looking for?A: For the industrial staffing business, we're going to be working with manufacturers. For administrative services, we work with a lot of service organizations, financial organizations, legal organizations. ... Many of the companies we work with are startup companies, nonprofit organizations.The biggest part of our business is the staffing part. The others are a lot newer, but they're all growing. We're seeing trends of more temp-to-hires and more direct placements than ever before. The large majority is still on the temporary side, but we're doing significantly more on the direct-placement side. Sometimes companies like to bring in an employee for a couple of months and test them to make sure they're a good fit in the organization before hiring them on. That's a model that some organizations have chosen.Q: How do you balance your responsibilities to the employees who are placed externally and your responsibilities to the client companies?A: It is a balancing act. In the outsourcing HR business, all of the hiring decisions are made by the client company. We're just there to support them. We're there for the on-boarding process and however else they want help from a human resources perspective, but determining who to hire is the company's decision.As it relates to the temporary staffing or recruiting business, it's all about looking at the candidate, understanding what their skills are, their goals, what they look for in terms of job responsibility and culture through assessment tests, and having a strong understanding of all of that. Then we also do that on the side of the company so we understand what skill sets they are looking for, what the culture of the company is, where they are going in the future, so that we can do a good job of matching the talent, skills and personality of the individual with the culture and job responsibilities that the company is trying to find.LONDA J.

98,7V07-XH30-Y959-00M9-00000-00.txt,"LETTER OF THE DAY: Bitten By Greedy PupsMy wife and I moved to Florida from Connecticut in July 2005. While living in Connecticut, I worked for almost 30 years at the home office of one of the country's largest multiline insurance companies.Insurance companies went merrily along for years collecting premiums and paying normal claims. Then came Hurricane Andrew in 1993. Extensive claims followed. Insurers threatened to pull out of the homeowner's market. The insurance commissioner panicked. He compromised and let them form ""pups"" - separate entities under the parent company that sold only homeowner's insurance in Florida.So now, instead of potential hurricane victims in Florida being in the same risk pool as tornado victims in Kansas and Oklahoma, ice storm victims in New York and Kentucky, forest fire victims in California and New Mexico, and flood victims in the Midwest, we were left to provide for ourselves. In this way, the Florida ""pups"" could show major losses to demand large premium increases and justify dropping policies while the parent company could show major profits.What should be done? It may be too late to do anything about the pups, but there are many single-line insurance companies out there that specialize in selling only auto, life, pension, health and/or annuity and not homeowner's. Perhaps state, county and local governments, as well as individuals and businesses, can move their insurance policies to these companies and out of the multiline parent companies that own the pups that gouge us.W. THOMAS WALCH JR.JupiterDisgusted With Capital 'D'It's insanity. I'm disgusted with our government, the financial ""gurus,"" banks, Daschle, Geithner, Killefer, Rangel, Blago, Richardson, Fuld, Thain, Madoff, Wells Fargo, B of A, to name just a few. When will it end?And now we have the infamous ""stimulus package,"" which is a gigantic Christmas wish list that will melt the North Pole and drive Santa into cardiac arrest. Parks, cars, neon lights, ACORN, contraceptives - give me a break. Some stimulus.This so-called ""***recession**-killing package"" convinces me that Nancy Pelosi continues her leadership role as the village idiot. Democrats have the power, but Republicans have the influence. Nice change, Dems. ""Spend"" has been changed to ""SPEND."" Where's the creativity from our elected officials?Get money into people's hands: tax incentives, car incentives, mortgage moratoriums. Forget the pet projects. People need and want the perception that the economic environment is improving. Oh, and one more thing: With all of these talented people in Washington (including the crooks), no one thought to write one line that said, ""No bonuses if you receive taxpayer money.""Be glad that you have a job; approximately 9 percent of us do not. As taxpayers, are we gullible, stupid or do not care? Or are we going to hold these people accountable?KURT SCHULZELutzPosition A WasteWhy do we need a new government position called ""chief performance officer?""Public Law 95-452, which was enacted in 1978, requires federal departments and agencies to establish independent offices of inspector general. These offices are staffed with highly qualified investigators, auditors, evaluators and inspectors. Their mission is to assure that their departments and agencies are functioning efficiently, economically and effectively and that there is no fraud, waste or abuse occurring in their programs or operations.The inspector generals are required to report semiannually to Congress, which has oversight over their operations. Consequently, establishing this position of chief performance officer, perhaps with a staff of its own, seems like a waste in itself.PAUL M. CARRENSun City CenterThe Worst Of TimesWorkers of America are the largest market in the world, producing more than we consume. Markets are now drying up because the cost of living is increasing faster than a worker's ability to earn, and their quest to attain the American dream is causing them to suffer mortgage failure and loss of credit, triggering action by businesses to eliminate jobs.Money managers and captains of industries have illusions of their own, including fraud. Payouts by industries to their officials have been exorbitant and include high-priced jet aircraft. Excessive spending to promote the sale of items is beyond comprehension, especially the cost of advertisements displayed during the Super Bowl and extravagant outlays for sports tournaments. Money for this is gained by the sale of goods workers produce on fixed incomes and minimum wages.The irresponsibility of managers increasing prices and the inability of workers to alter the price of goods are the causes of the system breaking down. I would advise our representatives in Washington to pay the stimulus money to the workers, who seem to have already earned it, and watch the economy improve by itself.This country is in worse shape than I've seen it in my lifetime, and that's a span of 97 years, which includes 1929. The buck stops here.HARTLEY STEEVESTampaHelping HomeownersHere is a simple way to deal with the catastrophic problems we face with the subprime mortgage foreclosure crisis:Instead of ""rewarding"" people who got into these disastrous deals, the feds could set up an agency to buy mortgages on owner-occupied homes that are upside-down, paying the lenders 90 percent of the value of the security (appraised value), as long as the mortgage is for no more than $150,000.They will be better off than if they spend money in foreclosure and sell the property to a shark for 25 cents on the $1.The agency could re-write the defaulted mortgages to a principal amount that includes what's past due so the borrowers start out ""current,"" re-set interest at a best available 30-year fixed rate, plus 1 percent (right now about 6 percent) and do negative amortization so that the payment is the same as the initial payment when the subprime started.Balloon the new mortgage so it is due in five to eight years. If we get out of this soon enough, by then the value of the home will have appreciated so the mortgage will no longer be upside-down, and the owner will have further incentive to stay.Homes will not have sat vacant all that time, courts will not have drowned in foreclosure actions and the economy will have had a chance to get back on its feet.Finally, if we want to limit government involvement, just sell re-written mortgages to banks that were bailed out for the principal amount of each mortgage.ROB HOSKINSSafety HarborPut Out To PastureBeing a longtime State Farm property and auto insurance client, to read that State Farm ""Florida"" is pulling out on property clients to cherry pick in other markets (i.e., auto policies) wreaks of dishonesty.The mother ship, ""State Farm"" is very profitable, and to claim that a small subsidiary, State Farm ""Florida"" is underfunded is ridiculous.The insurance commissioner should tell State Farm to take all their insurance products and my premiums and leave for good.My auto insurance premiums will be goingto either that witty gecko at GEICOor the stylish checkout girl Flo at Progressive from this day forward.I say ""Hasta la vista"" to State Farm.JOHN ""MATT"" FIELDLithiaHappy CustomerStunned, amazed, thrilled and excited - these were all emotions I felt upon opening up the Trib last Saturday and finding a copy of the New Testament inside.Many times my husband and I thought we would not renew our subscription because of the liberal leanings we so often have noticed. But this surprise find has given life to Mother Trib for another year in our home.What a wonderful, timely placement of the testament, with the Super Bowl and all the visitors here. Thank you, thank you, thank you.LAURIE BENTLEYTampaIt's How You PlayFor several years our family has gotten together to enjoy food and fun and the Super Bowl. When I was asked Monday whether my team won, I told them no, but the game reminded me of a quote that I remember seeing on a wall when I was a young girl:""For when the one Great Scorer comes to write against your name, He writes not that you won or lost, but how you played the game.""JEAN STILLWELLTampaClosely Watching EuropeI hope our politicians, especially Congress and the president, are paying attention to what's going on in Europe (""Protests A Sign Of Surging Anger In Europe,"" Feb. 2, Nation World"").These are people like us, tired of the corrupt politicians, overpaid CEOs, the crumbling economy, the ***mortgage crisis**, homelessness and hunger. I could go on, but I think that's a pretty good picture of what are dealing with here.But take note Congress and Mr. President: If real change isn't coming soon, a lot of people are going to be rioting just like they are in Europe. It is building and gaining momentum.So I say as an American: Get your act together, or what's taking place in other parts of the world is going to be happening right here in the good old USA.People are going to start demanding change, and they may not be as civil about it as they have been so far.GREGORY W.

He met with UBS Wealth clients and managers in Boise last week.The world economy is growing fast enough that it doesn't need the U.S. to boom quarter after quarter, Hoefert said.U.S. Gross Domestic Product growth should range from 2.5 to 3 percent in the third quarter when final tallies come in, down from about 4 percent in the second quarter, he predicted.Consumption should come in higher, but overall growth in GDP - the value of all goods and services produced - figures to be dragged by housing starts that remain some 30 percent below their early 2006 peak.Economic weakness should persist in the fourth quarter and into the first and second quarters of 2008, Hoefert said.""We're still not able to call it a ***recession**,"" the New York City-based Hoefert said, adding: ""Some people on the Street are starting to talk ***recession**. ""It's not certain that the U.S. economy would post back-to-back quarters of negative or non-growth, he said.""Beyond that, we can see another four or five quarters of very low, sub-3-percent, growth,"" Hoefert said.Housing weakness will drag consumption and could produce further impacts on the labor market, he said. The finance sector has been hard-hit already, he said.The recent liquidity crunch in the debt market has been contained in the financial sphere for the most part, Hoefert said.If it's ending, it hasn't done too much damage to the rest of the economy, he said. If more bad news comes out and confidence is lost, larger problems could result.""We still have in my view a very high interest rate,"" Hoefert said. The spread between Federal Funds and London Interbank Offered rates remain high compared to traditional norms, and ""there is still a little lack of confidence in the financial sector to lend each other money. ""He would not comment on UBS AG's recent announcement that it would suffer large loan-related losses in the third quarter and is making some management changes, except to say that the company is strong enough to absorb it and that it would not impact the growing UBS Wealth Management.U.S. exports are doing well on the strong world economy and the weak dollar, Hoefert said.In 25 years, China - not the U.S. - will be the largest economy, and some of Europe's larger economies will be smaller than those of Brazil, India, Indonesia and Mexico, he said.UBS Wealth Management's model portfolio now has a ""small overweight"" in emerging market equity, he said.These investments are promising but can be risky, and UBS recommends a 5 to 10 percent exposure for its most aggressive investors, he said.Other asset-allocation highlights from the UBS model portfolio include a larger overweight - compared to emerging markets - in U.S., Swiss and other European equity and major underweights in Australia and Canada.Sector-wise, UBS Wealth Management is overweighted in consumer staples, financials and health care.It's underweighted in consumer cyclicals and in materials. In the financial sector, some companies are cheap following the credit crunch, Hoefert said.He views the stock market as fairly valued.""Therefore, don't panic if something negative happens,"" Hoefert said. ""Even if we see a correction, the equity market could be a good opportunity. ""Investors also should keep an eye on currencies, he said. Compared to the U.S. dollar, the euro, Canadian dollar and British pound are overvalued while the Japanese yen and other Asian currencies are under-valued, he said.""It's a very interesting moment we are in, and it can go in either direction,"" Hoefert said.",1,,,
100,4SBP-T1D0-TW8F-G16T-00000-00.txt,"The Pennsylvania campaign, which produced yet another inconclusive result on Tuesday, was even meaner, more vacuous, more desperate, and more filled with pandering than the mean, vacuous, desperate, pander-filled contests that preceded it.  Voters are getting tired of it; it is demeaning the political process; and it does not work. It is past time for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to acknowledge that the negativity, for which she is mostly responsible, does nothing but harm to her, her opponent, her party and the 2008 election.   If nothing else, self interest should push her in that direction. Mrs. Clinton did not get the big win in Pennsylvania that she needed to challenge the calculus of the Democratic race. It is true that Senator Barack Obama outspent her 2-to-1. But Mrs. Clinton and her advisers should mainly blame themselves, because, as the political operatives say, they went heavily negative and ended up squandering a good part of what was once a 20-point lead.   On the eve of this crucial primary, Mrs. Clinton became the first Democratic candidate to wave the bloody shirt of 9/11. A Clinton television ad -- torn right from Karl Rove's playbook -- evoked the 1929 stock market crash, Pearl Harbor, the Cuban missile crisis, the cold war and the 9/11 attacks, complete with video of Osama bin Laden. ''If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen,'' the narrator intoned.  If that was supposed to bolster Mrs. Clinton's argument that she is the better prepared to be president in a dangerous world, she sent the opposite message on Tuesday morning by declaring in an interview on ABC News that if Iran attacked Israel while she were president: ''We would be able to totally obliterate them.''   By staying on the attack and not engaging Mr. Obama on the substance of issues like terrorism, the economy and how to organize an orderly exit from Iraq, Mrs. Clinton does more than just turn off voters who don't like negative campaigning. She undercuts the rationale for her candidacy that led this page and others to support her: that she is more qualified, right now, to be president than Mr. Obama.  Mr. Obama is not blameless when it comes to the negative and vapid nature of this campaign. He is increasingly rising to Mrs. Clinton's bait, undercutting his own claims that he is offering a higher more inclusive form of politics. When she criticized his comments about ''bitter'' voters, Mr. Obama mocked her as an Annie Oakley wannabe. All that does is remind Americans who are on the fence about his relative youth and inexperience.   No matter what the high-priced political operatives (from both camps) may think, it is not a disadvantage that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton share many of the same essential values and sensible policy prescriptions. It is their strength, and they are doing their best to make voters forget it. And if they think that only Democrats are paying attention to this spectacle, they're wrong.   After seven years of George W. Bush's failed with-us-or-against-us presidency, all American voters deserve to hear a nuanced debate -- right now and through the general campaign -- about how each candidate will combat terrorism, protect civil liberties, address the housing crisis and end the war in Iraq.  It is getting to be time for the superdelegates to do what the Democrats had in mind when they created superdelegates: settle a bloody race that cannot be won at the ballot box. Mrs. Clinton once had a big lead among the party elders, but has been steadily losing it, in large part because of her negative campaign. If she is ever to have a hope of persuading these most loyal of Democrats to come back to her side, let alone win over the larger body of voters, she has to call off the dogs.",0,,,
101,4V6S-2WK0-TX12-N01B-00000-00.txt,"c(""Dec. 23--Even in winter for the Minnesota economy, there are seeds of hope.Wall Street has melted down, devastating the world of hedge funds, private-equity firms and investment banks. But Minnesota was never a big player in those arenas.Where Minnesota is a powerhouse is in its array of blue-chip companies. And suddenly, many of them sport a new luster, thanks to their cautious ways, steady profits and strong balance sheets.For them, the troubled economy offers some of the best opportunities in years -- to make acquisitions at attractive prices, strengthening and expanding in new directions.\""The right time to buy is when you think it's a solid industry but when things don't look so good,\"" said John Johnson, chief executive of CHS Inc., an Inver Grove Heights-based grain and energy cooperative. \""Today, there are fewer buyers than there are sellers, which means there are going to be opportunities out there.\""So despite the gloomy economy, CHS is shopping. Other Minnesota companies -- from Medtronicto General Mills, Ameriprise Financial to Cargill -- have been browsing, too. Most prized are smart acquisitions that fuel growth, not necessarily blockbusters.St. Jude Medical just bagged two deals. On Monday, the medical device maker said it bought an Israeli company for $283 million, one day after purchasing a Swedish one for $250 million. The acquisitions gave Little Canada-based St. Jude new technologies and, it believes, a competitive lift.As with housing, what's enticing to corporate buyers is that the speculative froth has been squeezed from the market. Plus, there's a lot for sale. So as values slump, buyers with lots of cash are finding bargains, new technologies and hot properties within reach.\""Right now, it is interesting,\"" said Bill Hawkins, chief executive of medical device giant Medtronic, which is based in Fridley. \""With all of the valuations of companies somewhat deflated ... it puts us in a good position to be able to look at companies or products that may fit strategically with us. And you could argue, to some degree, it's an attractive time to add to our portfolio.\""A recent Medtronicacquisition shows why this matters, particularly in a state with rising unemployment and worries about job creation. In September, Medtronicbought the Canadian firmCryoCath Technologies, which had innovative ways to treat a heart irregularity called atrial fibrillation.That deal didn't add Minnesota jobs. But by opening a new front for Medtronic, it paves the way for job growth here, where Medtronicalready has 7,800 employees.\""I would expect that we would be adding more jobs here, as we build that business, than we would in Canada,\"" Hawkins said.One of the Twin Cities' strengths is that it doesn't have just a couple of blue-chip companies like Medtronicand CHS, but a broad lineup from a range of industries.The Dow Jones financial Web site MarketWatch recently rated the business climate in 50 metro areas, based on their history of spawning successful companies. Minneapolis-St. Paul was \""far and away\"" the No. 1-rated area in the nation, thanks to a rich collection of businesses large, medium and small.Not all those Minnesota businesses are equally healthy, of course. Some are burdened with heavy debts that suggest retreat, not expansion. Some, like MoneyGram International, strayed from conservative investment principles. Others are in cyclical industries, and stuck in a trough.And no business can avoid the grim news now coming in waves -- plunging stocks, collapsing companies, rising unemployment, soaring debt, difficult credit, frightened consumers, and on, and on.But the ***financial crisis** hasn't spread its carnage evenly. Among the hardest hit have been speculators who used mountains of cheap debt to buy hard assets, hoping to resell later at a profit. That includes the once-booming private-equity business, which for the past five years had been buying up companies at a frenzied pace.The credit crisis put an end to that era. And it tipped the playing field away from highly leveraged \""financial\"" buyers and back toward strong companies that want to buy, hold and operate businesses, not just flip them.\""It's taken some of the private-equity money out of play, so it's made prices more rational, and more geared toward strategic buyers, like us, who are in it for the long term,\"" Don Mulligan, General Mills' chief financial officer, said this fall.That's fine with private-equity critics, like Fred Zimmerman, a retired engineering professor at the University of St. Thomas who has written about economic development in Minnesota.\""There's not very strong empirical evidence that these (private-equity) companies have any strong management skills,\"" Zimmerman said.But Zimmerman has his own concerns about Minnesota's economy.\""Minnesota has a general problem with its smugness,\"" he added. \""If you look at how the state of Minnesota has unfolded in the last 15 years, it's been gradually slipping from being an above-average state to being a below-average state in terms of economic growth.\""Gov. Tim Pawlenty has been circulating job-creation data showing that, in the past five years, Minnesota ranks 36th of the 50 states in creating new jobs. In next year's legislative session, he vows to change tax policies to make Minnesota a friendlier state for creating jobs.Meanwhile, corporate Minnesota offers lessons about turning hard times into opportunity. Cargill, the Wayzata-based grain giant, has a long history of buying distressed assets that eventually bear fruit.In 2004, Cargill purchased a struggling fertilizer giant, IMC Global, which had crushing debts but lucrative properties. Cargill melded IMC with its existing fertilizer business, then spun it off into a public company and waited for better days.By 2007, that spinoff, called Mosaic Co., became the best-performing large-cap stock in the nation.Yet even then, plans were being laid for the next ***economic downturn**. Mosaic's former chief executive, Fritz Corrigan, explained the game plan back in 2005.\""Pay down debt, and get the balance sheet real strong, so during the next turn in the business, when other people are giving up the ghost, we'll be able to buy significantly.\""Today, that next downturn has begun. Since June, Mosaic's stock has dropped 81 percent.Some will see crisis. Others, opportunity.Tom Webb can be reached at 651-228-5428.To see more of the Pioneer Press, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.twincities.com.

I don't think it's that bad,\"" Ms. Sigel told about 40 members of the Airport Corridor Transportation Association.She said she envisions a new, long-term transportation measure with increased funding, more accountability and an emphasis on repairing existing infrastructure and environmental sustainability.Her remarks came as transportation advocates and some Democrats on Capitol Hill pushed for a second round of economic stimulus funding for infrastructure improvements.McClatchy Newspapers reported last week that there was growing Democratic support on Capitol Hill for a new jobs bill to provide more economic stimulus next year, with Democrats fearful that continuing high unemployment will hurt them at the polls next year.The American Public Transportation Association urged Congress to invest at least $15 billion in public transit to generate jobs and stimulate the economy.The association said its national survey of public transit systems identified more than $15 billion in capital projects that can be started within 90 days and create or support more than 450,000 jobs.\""Let's get Americans back to work,\"" said association President William Millar, a former Port Authority executive director. \""It is essential that a jobs bill include public transportation investment to create good-paying jobs for Americans.\""A group representing state transportation departments released a report listing 9,500 \""ready-to-go\"" projects costing more than $69 billion that it said would generate hundreds of thousands of construction jobs.\""State departments of transportation have proven that these 'ready-to-go' projects are a great way to put people back work, quickly and efficiently,\"" said John Horsley, executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.\""A bright spot of the economic recovery act continues to be state transportation projects that are pumping billions of dollars into households and businesses while fixing our broken transportation network,\"" he said.\""We need to keep the momentum going. The unemployment rate in the construction trades today exceeds 18 percent,\"" Mr. Horsley said. \""There is still a need to invest more in transportation projects if that's what it takes to create jobs and bring unemployment down.\""The Obama administration and both branches of Congress agree that more money needs to be spent on transportation.Delaying movement on a new six-year transportation bill is disagreement over how to fund it, Ms. Sigel told the airport corridor association.\""Everything is on the table,\"" she said, including an increase in the federal gasoline tax, a new vehicle-miles-traveled fee, tolling of interstate highways and more public-private partnerships to build and upgrade highways.The former transportation measure expired Sept. 30, and Congress has approved two short-term extensions, the second of which keeps funding flowing until Dec. 18.But language in the old bill, known by the acronym SAFETEA-LU, rescinded $8.7 billion in spending authority on Sept. 30, lowering the formula for continuing allocations to the states, Ms. Sigel said. States are getting $1 billion less per month.Ms. Sigel's audience, made up of transportation professionals from the public and private sectors, was pessimistic about the prospects for congressional action. Asked for a show of hands, no one thought a new bill would be passed by June and about half indicated they didn't expect action until 2011.Pennsylvania has obligated more than 85 percent of the $1 billion in highway stimulus funds it was awarded, but so far only about 18 percent has been paid out. Pennsylvania is sixth nationally in the dollar amount of transportation funds spent but 27th in the percentage spent, Ms. Sigel said.She said she was encouraged by reports of a possible second round of stimulus funding. \""I'll welcome whatever they send us. We've done great things with the first bill, and we'd love to have a second billion,\"" she said.In response to a question, Ms. Sigel said the application by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission to impose tolls on Interstate 80 was \""being reviewed as expeditiously and thoroughly as it can,\"" but she would not speculate on when a decision would be announced.The proposed tolls are a key part of Act 44, the measure passed by the state Legislature in 2007 to alleviate a funding crisis affecting highway and bridge projects and public transit systems.Business groups in the I-80 corridor and several members of the state's congressional delegation are opposed to the tolls.""

103,4RRX-94T0-TWD7-X02S-00000-00.txt," Frank and Deborah Popper's idea of creating a ""Buffalo Commons"" on huge swaths of the depopulating Great Plains drew catcalls and worse when they first promoted it 20 years ago. Times have changed - and attitudes, economies and outlooks - since the Poppers rocked the Plains from Canada to Texas, including western Oklahoma. Just how much might be gauged Wednesday when the Poppers return to Oklahoma to update the situation and their thinking. Frank Popper, a land-use planner at Rutgers University, and Deborah, his wife and a geographer at the City University of New York's College of Staten Island, will present a public lecture and question-and-answer period starting at 4 p.m. Wednesday at the National Weather Center at the University of Oklahoma in Norman. A reception will follow from 5 to 6 p.m. Wednesday. The center is at 120 David L Boren Blvd., at the corner of Jenkins Avenue and State Highway 9. The lecture title: ""The Buffalo Commons in the Twenty-First Century."" The Poppers will talk about ""how the Great Plains, including Oklahoma, is in environmental crisis,"" according to a press release from OU's College of Atmospheric Geographic Sciences, which is playing host. ""They hope to stimulate discussions on how to radically change land-use practices now and for future generations."" The Poppers were met with ridicule and hostility after an academic paper they coauthored in 1987 became news - and the talk of farmers coops, coffee shops and opinion columns across the Plains states. The article, ""The Great Plains: From Dust to Dust,"" appeared in the December 1987 issue of Planning magazine. The subtitle: ""A daring proposal for dealing with an inevitable disaster."" The Poppers proposed that policy-makers work with landowners and conservationists to reclaim the Great Plains and create a ""Buffalo Commons"" - an open range in the public domain harking to the days before white settlement, when Indian tribes did hold land in common. The Poppers lectured in Oklahoma City and Norman in 1990. ""We're looking forward to coming back. In 1990 everyone in Oklahoma was very polite about our work, but clearly pained and annoyed about it too,"" Frank Popper said Friday. ""In the last 10 years or so, attitudes elsewhere have softened a bit after the continuing census results, groundwater losses, rising farm subsidies, possibilities of climate change, not much of an acknowledged factor in 1990. ""People recognize a kernel of truth in what we are saying, but they don't necessarily agree that the Buffalo Commons or some version of it is the solution. Over the years the Buffalo Commons has been interpreted in an extraordinary number of ways. Sometimes they see that Deborah and I have put our finger on a problem, but have a way out that is wildly different from any possible interpretation of the Buffalo Commons. But we're really curious about what the Oklahoma reactions will be. And no matter what they are, we are hoping for and anticipating a vigorous discussion all around.""

104,4TFW-7WB0-TWHW-60HY-00000-00.txt,"NEW YORK -- Oil prices closed below $100 a barrel for the first time in six months Monday, tumbling in another dramatic sell-off as the demise of Lehman Brothersand the sale of Merrill Lynchdeepened worries about the U.S. economy.Crude prices shed more than $5 a barrel and have now given up virtually all their gains for the year, extending a steep, two-month slide from record levels above $147 a barrel.Oil's pullback also came as early signs suggested that Hurricane Ike delivered less damage than feared to the Gulf Coast energy oil and gas infrastructure. But pump prices jumped above $4 a gallon in parts of the country as a precautionary shutdown of Gulf refineries caused gasoline shortages.The latest sell-off in oil began Sunday and accelerated Monday as traders digested a day of dramatic upheaval on Wall Street.Lehman, Merrill and other big institutional investors were major participants in the commodities boom of the past year, helping push the price of oil, precious metals and grains to historic highs until a slowing global economy helped bring a halt to the rally.Analysts said investors feared that the upheaval in the financial sector could trigger another round of commodities liquidation -- especially with Lehman likely to unwind its holdings. Other investors may also unload commodities, fearing that the deepening ***economic crisis** will further reduce demand for energy and raw materials futures.""I think this is giving the bulls further reason to exit the market,"" said Stephen Schork, an oil analyst and trader in Villanova, Pa., who said the pullback could reflect selling by Lehman or possibly a hedge fund struggling to raise capital. ""When you see price drops of this size, it reeks of someone being in trouble.""Light, sweet crude for October delivery fell $5.47 to settle at $95.71 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange -- oil's first settlement under $100 since March 4. Earlier, prices dipped to $94.13, the lowest trading level in seven months. The sell-off gained momentum in aftermarket trading as prices fell more than $6.50.Crude has fallen more than $50 -- or 35 percent -- from its all-time trading record of $147.27 reached July 11 as a global ***economic slowdown** continues to weigh on demand for energy.Other commodities traded mixed Monday, with energy futures down but gold, silver and most grains trading higher.Investors were also awaiting damage assessments to Gulf energy infrastructure after Ike's passage.U.S. officials said Sunday that Ike destroyed at least 10 oil and gas platforms and damaged pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico. But that represents only a small portion of the 3,800 production platforms in the Gulf and pales in comparison to the catastrophic damage to energy infrastructure doled out by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita three years ago.""Fears of widespread refinery damage have been allayed considerably and a number of facilities are coming back up in a timely fashion,"" said Jim Ritterbusch, president of energy consultancy Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Ill.Still, power outages along the Gulf Coast were slowing efforts to restart some refineries. Meanwhile, virtually all oil production in the Gulf and about 94 percent of natural gas output remained shut-in Monday, according to the U.S. Minerals Management Service.The shutdown of Gulf refineries sent wholesale gasoline prices spiking last week and pushed pump prices back above $4 a gallon in South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia and other states. Gasoline shortages were reported in Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina.On Monday, a gallon of regular rose half a penny overnight to a new national average of $3.842 -- up 16.7 cents from Friday, according to auto club AAA, the Oil Price Information Service and Wright Express.Tom Kloza, publisher and chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service in Wall, N.J., said supply shortages caused by Ike and Hurricane Gustav should last at least another two weeks.""That means we're looking at close to $4 a gallon for the rest of September,"" Kloza said. ""People are going to observe more of this disconnect where retail prices move higher even though crude oil is trading below $100 a barrel.""Also adding to the selling pressure Monday was a slightly stronger dollar. A rising greenback encourages investors to unload commodities bought as a hedge against inflation or weakness in the U.S. currency.Oil fell despite reports that militants have launched another attack Nigeria's oil infrastructure in a third day of violence.In other Nymex trading, heating oil futures fell 14.79 cents to settle at $2.7912 a gallon, while gasoline prices dropped 20.82 cents to settle at $2.5614 a gallon. Natural gas for October delivery rose about a penny to settle at $7.374 per 1,000 cubic feet.In London, October Brent crude fell $5.20 to settle at $92.38 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange.",0,,,
105,7WFM-4840-Y9NC-P35W-00000-00.txt,"It's never a contest when the interests of big business are pitted against the public interest. So if we manage to get health care ""reform"" this time around it will be the kind of reform that benefits the very people who have given us a failed system, and thus made reform so necessary.Forget about a crackdown on price-gouging drug companies and predatory insurance firms. That's not happening. With the public pretty well confused about what is going on, we're headed -- at best -- toward changes that will result in a lot more people getting covered, but that will not control exploding health care costs and will leave industry leaders feeling like they've hit the jackpot.The hope of a government-run insurance option is all but gone. So there will be no effective alternative for consumers in the market for health coverage, which means no competitive pressure for private insurers to rein in premiums and other charges. (Forget about the nonprofit cooperatives. That's like sending peewee footballers up against the Super Bowl champs.)Insurance companies are delighted with the way ""reform"" is unfolding. Think of it: The government is planning to require most uninsured Americans to buy health coverage. Millions of young and healthy individuals will be herded into the industry's welcoming arms. This is the population the insurers drool over.This additional business -- a gold mine -- will more than offset the cost of important new regulations that, among other things, will prevent insurers from denying coverage to applicants with pre-existing conditions or imposing lifetime limits on benefits. Poor people will either be funneled into Medicaid, which will have its eligibility ceiling raised, or will receive a government subsidy to help with the purchase of private insurance.If the oldest and sickest are on Medicare, and the poorest are on Medicaid, and the young and the healthy are required to purchase private insurance without the option of a competing government-run plan -- well, that's reform the insurance companies can believe in.And then there are the drug companies. A couple of months ago the Obama administration made a secret and extremely troubling deal with the drug industry's lobbying arm, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. The lobby agreed to contribute $80 billion in savings over 10 years and to sponsor a multimillion-dollar ad campaign in support of health care reform.The White House, for its part, agreed not to seek additional savings from the drug companies over those 10 years. This resulted in big grins and high fives at the drug lobby. The White House was rolled. The deal meant that the government's ability to use its enormous purchasing power to negotiate lower drug prices was off the table.The $80 billion in savings (in the form of discounts) would apply only to a certain category of Medicare recipients -- those who fall into a gap in their drug coverage known as the doughnut hole -- and only to brand-name drugs. (Drug industry lobbyists probably chuckled, knowing that some patients would switch from generic drugs to the more expensive brand names in order to get the industry-sponsored discounts.)To get a sense of how sweet a deal this is for the drug industry, compare its offer of $8 billion in savings a year over 10 years with its annual profits of $300 billion a year. Robert Reich, who served as labor secretary in the Clinton administration, wrote that the deal struck by the Obama White House was very similar to the ""deal George W. Bush struck in getting the Medicare drug benefit, and it's proven a bonanza for the drug industry.""The bonanza to come would be even larger, he said, ""given all the Boomers who will be enrolling in Medicare over the next decade.""While it is undoubtedly important to bring as many people as possible under the umbrella of health coverage, the way it is being done now does not address what Obama and so many other advocates have said is a crucial component of reform -- bringing the ever-spiraling costs of health care under control. Those costs, we're told, are hamstringing the U.S. economy, making us less competitive globally and driving up the budget deficit.Giving consumers the choice of an efficient, nonprofit, government-run insurance plan would have moved us toward real cost control, but that option has gone a-glimmering.The public deserves better. The drug companies, the insurance industry and the rest of the corporate high-rollers have their tentacles all over this so-called reform effort, squeezing it for all it's worth.Meanwhile, the public -- struggling with the worst ***economic downturn** since the 1930s -- is looking on with great anxiety and confusion. If the drug companies and the insurance industry are smiling, it can only mean that the public interest is being left behind.",0,,,

He is the author of Business Ethics A Jewish Perspective (Ktav, 1997), Leading with Meaning: Using Covenantal Leadership to Build a Better Organization (Palgrave Macmillan, 2003) and the forthcoming Jewish Ethics as Dialogue, due out from Palgrave Macmillan in 2009."", ""Our communities  honor those with  the biggest bank  accounts.I got to know Bernie Madoff  through his service to Yeshiva  University's Sy Syms School  of Business. Until news of the  scandal broke, he served as chairman  of our board. I, and other  faculty members, worked closely  with him on an academic committee,  meeting frequently at his  now-infamous Midtown office.He is charming, soft-spoken and  fatherly. Like the old E. F. Hutton  commercials, when Bernie spoke,  people listened. As he presumably  did for many others, he provided  us with charismatic leadership  and a strong sense of security  and optimism. There was little  doubt when Bernie Madoff was  in the room about who was the  decision-maker.Now, of course, the money is  gone, the charisma has evaporated  and, instead of security and optimism,  there is fear, uncertainty  and concern about the future.Personally, I begin to wonder,  does my work teaching business  ethics even matter? Can an academic  course on business ethics  really stop a would-be Bernie  Madoff? Not likely.Bernie Madoff stole gigantic sums  of money, but perhaps more importantly  he has diminished society's  stock of social capital. In a single  stroke, the revelation of his actions  has made it more difficult for us to  trust one another. He has loosened  the taken-for-granted connections  that bind us together and robbed  us of some of our faith and hope  in the future. If yesterday, some of  us were naïve idealists, today we  are all hard-headed realists. And  that is a shame.But, of course, we all know  that Bernie Madoff was not acting  alone. He had many enablers.  There are those who invested  other people's money with him  and did not engage in the due  diligence their position of responsibility  required. There were likely  others who invested with him suspecting  that all was not kosher but  assuming that he was earning real  profits with inside information or  by front-running.Perhaps the biggest enabler  though is the prevailing ethos of  the business world. We live in a  world that has become increasingly  oriented toward a bottom-line  mentality. Ours is a culture  of money first. In every business  school I know of, we teach our students  to maximize profits. Good  enough is never enough.Our Jewish communities,  which once honored rabbis and  scholars, now almost exclusively  honor those with the biggest bank  accounts. Our students and children  surely take note of this.Bernie Madoff should be punished  for his wrong-doing, but wesimply fool ourselves if we think  that jailing Madoff will solve the  deeper problem of which he is just  the most recent symptom.With every crisis, however,  comes a new opportunity. We need  to stop looking for mechanical  solutions to our ethics failures and  start discussing more meaningful  ones. We face a defining moment.  We can go back and try to do what  we were doing before, only better,  or we can move forward and  critically reconsider our goals and  priorities. This demands not only  a change in actions but a change  in consciousness, as well.I suggest that in business we  replace profit-maximization with  sustainability. We should supplement  traditional financial statements  with triple bottom-line  statements that measure social  and environmental performance in  addition to economic performance  The latter should stress long-term  success and not just short-term  profitability. The Jewish tradition,  a 3,000-year-old and ongoing project,  has much to contribute to this  discussion.Further, I suggest we challenge  those who separate completely  business and economic affairs  from the rest of life. I suggest we  resurrect and reinvigorate the biblical  vision of combining earning a  livelihood and acting in a just and  caring way. The institutions of the  jubilee and sabbatical years have  much to teach us today if we give  up on a literal interpretation of the  Torah text and seek to understand  the egalitarian spirit and caring  ethos underlying these ideas. The  mitzvah of loving the stranger  takes on an added dimension and  urgency in a global economy and  interconnected world.We should stop looking for outsized  heroes and begin to participate  in lively ethical dialogue with  one another. The Torah speaks of  brit, or covenant, in nearly every  one of its books. We need to re-imagine  the meaning of covenant   a shared agreement among  equal partners  and demand that  it speak appropriately to a pluralistic  and postmodern world.I will continue to teach business  ethics but I have learned through  recent events that this is only a  tiny part of a much larger job  Unless we all become informa  ethics teachers, none of us wil  get where we want to go.""

108,4VBB-8M70-TY2M-21GB-00000-00.txt,".S. secretary of state Condoleezza Rice has cancelled her planned trip to Beijing to attend the celebrations marking the anniversary in order to deal with the worsening crisis in the Middle East.John Negroponte, Rice's deputy, is arriving in her place to represent the U.S. at the event in Beijing this week.The crisis in Gaza though is just a shadow over the festivities, compared to the serious soul-searching the two sides have been engaging in on the eve of their bilateral ties anniversary.Given the backdrop of the biggest ***economic crisis** the two sides have experienced since reestablishing relations in 1979, the anniversary has been a time of reckoning for both sides.'In the short span of 30 years, with the joint efforts of several generations of Chinese leaders, seven U.S. presidents and people in both countries, the ship of China-U.S. relations has forged ahead, come rain or shine,'' Dai Bingguo, a Chinese State Councillor, said in a speech released by the state news agency Xinhua this week.'It has brought tremendous benefits to our two peoples and contributed greatly to world peace and development,'' Dai Bingguo said in his speech.The anniversary celebrates the U.S. decision to switch diplomatic recognition from self-ruled democratic Taiwan to communist mainland China on Jan. 1, 1979. The diplomatic hop was made possible by a groundbreaking visit to Beijing by former U.S. president Richard Nixon in 1972 and a reciprocal visit by Deng Xiaoping to the U.S.The normalisation of relations coincided with China's decision to embark on free-market reforms. The Communist Party had decided in December 1978 to endorse small-scale private farming, the first step towards abandoning Mao's vision of communal agriculture and embracing free market.No other diplomatic relationship has proved more conducive to China's emergence as an economic powerhouse than ties with Washington. Today, the two countries are entwined economically and politically to an extent unimaginable when ties were normalised in 1979.But it is this tight embrace that is now proving the biggest headache for the two nations as they struggle with the ***economic crisis**.In the earlier stages of China's economic reform and opening, Beijing was dependent on the U.S. for valuable financial, technological and managerial knowhow. But as the country has developed, domestic capital has displaced foreign funds as the main source for investment.What is more, armed with the foreign currency earned mainly from low-cost manufacturing exports, China has emerged as the largest creditor of the U.S.Experts estimate that over the last 10 years, Beijing has invested around one trillion US dollars in dollar-denominated assets. If for whatever reason China decides to sell a portion of these holdings, it would trigger a collapse in the value of the US dollar.U.S. dependence on China's lending is regarded by some in America as potentially risky and there is fear that Beijing might decide to use its holdings of U.S. government debt as a bargaining chip in bilateral relations.But even if not used as an effective political tool, China's purchases of U.S. debt are a 'demonstration of China's financial leverage,' argue others.'The U.S. runs the risk that it could need China to add to its foreign exchange reserves more than China actually needs more reserves -- an asymmetry that potentially gives China the ability to influence U.S. policy,' Brad Setser, fellow at the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in the magazine 'China Security.'Already, some Chinese officials have expressed frustration with U.S. economic and financial policies and complained about China's potential exposure to the weakness of the dollar. Chinese scholars have been even blunter.Writing in the same magazine, Zha Xiaogang, a researcher at the department of World Economic Studies at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies, warned that China is running out of patience with the U.S.'s lack of 'disciplined financial and monetary policy.''Washington should no longer expect China to stand at the receiving end, buying treasury bonds despite great fluctuations in the value of the dollar,' he said.'As America's largest creditor, China will expect the U.S. to exhaust every means to protect the safety of its investments,'' Zha Xiaogang wrote. ''Otherwise, the Chinese public will voice their objection loudly and exert great pressure on Beijing to reverse the policy.'But, as they gather to celebrate the anniversary, Chinese officials are also fully aware that the two economies are so interlinked that the U.S. needs a helping hand from Chinese capital as much as China needs the U.S. market.With Americans consuming less, the knock-off on the Chinese economy with its export-driven growth model has become obvious in recent months. About one-third of Chinese exports, including re-exports from Hong Kong, are destined for the U.S. market.With the collapse of trade, factory closures and layoffs have been spreading rapidly in the country's export-manufacturing hubs.Some of the workers have rioted to protests closures and claim unpaid wages. Chinese leaders are terrified that the ***economic crisis** might herald a wave of social unrest for the country, endangering their own grip on power.Having allowed the yuan to rise a little after 2005, Chinese leaders are now under intense domestic pressure to reverse course and depreciate it. As bankruptcies have multiplied, unemployment has risen rapidly.Some economists argue that the appreciation of the yuan, urged by the U.S. and other western trading partners, has hurt China's exports more than the slump in demand caused by the economic ***recession**.'Since 2005 the value of the yuan has risen nearly 30 percent against the US dollar,' says Zeng Xiangquan, an expert on labour issues at China's Renmin University.

109,4TVH-G420-TX12-N0FK-00000-00.txt,"c(""Nov. 1--YOUNGSTOWN -- The ***economic downturn** hitting the nation may mean an upturn in campus improvement projects at Youngstown State University.The interest rates on borrowing money through the bond market have apparently dropped to the point where the YSU Board of Trustees is considering expanding the size and scope of a $40 million bond issue the university plans to borrow in December or early 2009.The issue could go to $50 million or more.The matter came up at a trustees' Finance and Facilities Committee meeting, and although specific rates weren't discussed, members of the board suggested now might be the time to consider expanding the improvement project list.The cost of borrowing $50 million at lower rates might not be much different than the cost of borrowing $40 million before the market dropped, said Scott Schulick, trustee chairman.The committee is expected to hear more from its financial consultants at a Nov. 20 meeting.The trustees already have the debt service on a $40 million bond issue covered, thanks to an early-retirement incentive program that resulted in annual savings of about $2.5 million -- the estimated annual cost of a $40 million bond issue six weeks ago.Interest rates have dropped and are probably at a 40-year low now, Schulick said.The university is actually looking at a total improvement package of $82 million but only planned to borrow $40 million. The rest is to be covered with $34 million in state capital funds, $3.4 million in philanthropic gifts, $2.8 million in internal funds and $1.2 million in federal grants.At the top of that list is the $34.3 million Williamson College of Business Administration, with $20 million of that amount coming from the bond issue. The rest is in private donations.Increasing the bond package can add some projects to the list.Gene Grilli, vice president for finance and administration, presented the committee with a review of the current $40 million list along with a look at four additional projects that would boost the borrowing to just over $49 million.Dr. David C. Sweet, YSU president, said favorable interest rates may allow the university to expand to the longer list.Schulick asked the administration to prepare a more detailed explanation of project specifics for the committee to examine Nov. 20.Trustee Harry Meshel said the administration should also include any other projects it might think are important. Now may be the best time to look at everything, he said.\""Let's see it all,\"" he said.\""We have a $60 million version too,\"" Sweet quipped, drawing chuckles from the committee.Meshel said that he personally would like to see the university's proposed indoor athletic practice facility show up on the list to the tune of about $5 million.To see more of the Vindicator, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.vindy.com.

110,4S87-7970-TWD8-K0WD-00000-00.txt,"IN WASHINGTON OFFICES, in Wall Street executive suites, in university economics departments and in law schools, fevered folk are hopefully catching up on readings they've missed or barely recall - accounts of the early days of the Great Depression.They are digging up copies of Arthur Schlesinger's works on the age of Franklin Delano Roosevelt - The Crisis of the Old Order and The Coming of the New Deal, John Kenneth Galbraith on the bursting of financial bubbles, A Short History of Financial Euphoria, even taking a clandestine covert peek at Thorstein Veblen's Vested Interests and the Common Man. They are desperately trying to get a handle on dealing with near-cataclysm, hoping to be first with the ""next new thing"" after the crisis of our Extreme Version of Capitalism is rejected - again.They are discovering what some economic and political observers knew and then forgot as the nation was jogged rightward over the past few decades: What happens to ordinary folk determines America's financial health; when the people are cut, Wall Street bleeds.Even as Ben Bernanke's Federal Reserve gallops to the rescue of banks, brokerages and other financial firms, while our manful steward of crisis, George W. Bush, hails Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson for doing a heck of a job -""Thank you for working over the weekend, Mr. Secretary""- millions of so-called ""ordinary homeowners"" still await help to keep their families in their homes before the repo man kicks them out.Indeed, many were so desperate for a hunk of ""the American Dream"" that they failed to read the tiny print about ""adjustables"" and pay-offs in the mortgage documents they signed. But it was the mortgage industry that jimmied the print, and Wall Street that loaded up on the collateralized debt obligations into which those mortgages were packaged to investors - passing them on to ""the next fool"" and pocketing big profits before the bubble burst.Wall Street bails now for buoyancy on a wave of government and foreign aid, as influentials quietly reconsider the formulas that Roosevelt's advisers urged on him to save the nation in the 1930s. Concepts labeled ""liberalism,""""populism"" and ""progressivism."" The very same oligarchs and neocons who wanted to ""drown government in the bathtub"" while exploiting the Federal Machine to enrich themselves and their friends, now think it okay to dispense government welfare to the finance industry, and ignore subprime homeowners who need bailouts.So far, proposals that would let bankruptcy judges or other agencies lower onerous mortgage rates, while guaranteeing their worth, still lie on the table - as Mr. Bush finds humor in the crisis and offers them ersatz Help Now. Nothing will firmly end the credit crunch unless officials accept that the Wall Street crisis and the subprime crisis are inextricably linked, and the president, the Fed chairman and the Treasury secretary publicly declare that the government will stand behind all home loans issued by quasi-governmental mortgage lenders.If we are lucky, the presidential candidates will ""get it""- they are running their races on empty as long as they are based on sound bites rather than sound policy.For 40 years, a vast industry has been moving America rightward - away from the liberal pragmatism of Roosevelt, Kennedy and Johnson, which rested on using government to balance instead of polarize the two contending estates - the very rich and the rest. The latter are seen not as citizens but as ""consumers,"" under a system based on their ability and willingness to spend.Ironically, ultra-con policy has been choking off their spending power, while widening the gulf between the oligarchy and the middle-to-lower classes. This rightward-driving movement, dangerously mislabeled ""conservatism"" because there is very little it would conserve, is aided by the historical forgetfulness that is a hallmark of this nation. The Machine has used cleverness and money to make liberal populism the enemy of the state. So-called think tanks (really propaganda organs), publishing houses, policy institutes, the commercial broadcasting industry - from mighty Fox to loudmouth television and radio - have manipulated people to vote against their own interests, and concealed its class-warfare aims by accusing the left of the same crime. Such mind-engineering converted intellectualism into ""elitism."" Only the late Bill Buckley had a right-wing license to use big words.Those who hold the institutional memory of direct encounter with the ravages of the Great Depression are dying off. We need a refresher course on liberalism - that it was pragmatic, populist-liberals who reversed the economic decline in the 1930s, devised Social Security (which keeps more than 50 percent of seniors out of the poorhouse today), supported the constructive unionism of American labor, won World War II, engineered the global spread of American power that was the fruit of victory, and created a policy of mutual assured destruction to topple the Soviet Empire.The national health depends on a renaissance of liberal principle, based on a restored balance between great wealth and the citizenry, the staking of common ground among the haves, have-somes, and have-nots. Indeed, a long-polarized Congress may be on the verge of rediscovering the efficacy of moving left and finding common ground. Legislation is belatedly shaping up to help homeowners avoid the loss of their homes. Sen. Richard Shelby, a Republican co-sponsor, declares: ""They are inextricably linked, finance and housing."" The restoration of good government rests on the restoration of that linkage.Jerry M. Landay, an occasional contributor, is a former CBS News correspondent.",1,,,
111,4TSV-19Y0-TW8F-G1D1-00000-00.txt,"c(""WITH the economy reeling, Amy Birnbaum, a Broadway production assistant who lives in New York, wasn't planning to take a winter vacation until after the holidays, when prices are typically lower. But when researching vacation options online recently, she came across a deal too good to pass up: a five-day trip to Bermuda, including nonstop airfare from New York, with a large suite (complete with kitchen) right on the beach for about $800 a person over the week of Christmas.   It was a trip that in years past would normally have cost $1,500 or more, Ms. Birnbaum said, adding that she was looking forward to balmy weather in December. ''Going from the harsh New York winter to a 70-degree day in Bermuda is wonderful,'' she said.  Pack your stockings and mistletoe. Sure Christmas is only two months away  and holiday hot spots are normally booked solid by now. But the recent Wall Street meltdown (and continued global financial turmoil) is turning into something of a last-minute gift to bargain-seeking vacationers who have yet to make holiday travel plans.   Faced with sluggish bookings as more travelers consider whether they can actually afford a holiday trip this year, resorts from the Caribbean to the Colorado Rockies are loosening minimum-stay restrictions, beefing up packages and even rolling out off-season-like discounts to attract cost-conscious travelers.  Spring Creek Ranch in popular Jackson Hole, Wyo., is offering a Ski Free package over the holidays that includes breakfast, lift tickets and a savings of 30 percent off normal rates. Park Hyatt Beaver Creek Resort and Spa is offering five nights for the price of four, between Dec. 25 and Jan. 3, and at a lowered nightly rate; this year's package works out to just under $3,800, and would have cost nearly $5,500 last year. And Vail Resorts, which operates several major ski areas and the luxury hotel brand RockResorts, is running a Holidays on Us promotion across all its properties including the popular Hotel Jerome in Aspen, Snake River Lodge &amp; Spa in Jackson Hole and the Landings in St. Lucia. Guests who book five consecutive nights over one of the major holidays by Nov. 1 get the holiday itself, be it Thanksgiving Day, Christmas or Easter, free.   Such promotions are normally unheard of over the winter holidays, typically the busiest time for resorts. But this year, the market crash has made some travelers skittish about spending all that money on a vacation. Bjorn Hanson, an associate professor at the Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University, says that holiday bookings are down around 10 to 15 percent so far versus this time last year. And 66 percent of respondents to a recent poll by Travelocity.com said concerns about the economy would affect their holiday travel plans. Of those who planned to take a holiday trip, 65 percent had not yet booked.   Walter S. Ciciora, an engineering consultant from Southport, Conn., is one of those still holding off. He plans to use accrued miles to fly himself and his wife out to Chicago to spend Christmas with her mother. But he hasn't booked the four hotel rooms he needs for the family just yet. ''We will be waiting until the last minute,'' he said, ''hoping for a reasonable deal.''   Some coveted resorts that would usually be fully reserved for the holidays by financial executives and other well-heeled guests actually have space available, as clients postpone vacations or cancel them altogether. ''I'm seeing a lot of e-mails from hotels that space is opening up during Christmas and New Year's,'' said June Sloane, a luxury travel specialist at Sue Brown Travel in Boca Raton, Fla.  Some of the best bargains are to be found in places that have already been struggling with the sagging economy amid flight cutbacks and rising airfare and thus are offering what are particularly tempting deals for the holidays. (Always dreamed of celebrating New Year's on a Hawaiian beach? You may finally get the chance.) Even the dollar suddenly looks stronger amid the growing global ***economic crisis**, with the greenback buying more in places like Mexico, South Africa and, especially, Iceland than it did a year ago. Below, a holiday guide for the last-minute traveler:  Room at the Top  If your ideal Christmas morning involves waking up in an oceanfront suite with butler service or sipping hot cocoa before heading out of your slopeside hotel room -- and you've never been able to score that kind of trip in the past because you weren't willing to book a year in advance -- you may be in luck this December.   A recent call to the reservations line of the Little Nell in Aspen, where a ski concierge is assigned to warm guests' boots, found at least two room categories to choose from (a $1,100-a-night standard mountainside or $1,145-a-night premium townside) for travelers willing to check in on Dec. 18 and check out on Christmas Day. Las Ventanas al Paraiso in Los Cabos, Mexico, where $1,675-a-night one-bedroom suites come with butler service, was sold out from Dec. 26 to Jan 2, but had several suites available Dec. 19 to 26. Cap Juluca, the popular Moorish-style luxury resort on Anguilla, said Thanksgiving bookings have been coming in slower than last year and a three-bedroom villa (at $134,001 for a minimum 14-night package) was still up for grabs from Dec. 20 to Jan. 3. Curtain Bluff Resort in Antigua had an executive one-bedroom suite ($1,845 a night) open for Christmas, but not New Year's. Even the 15-villa Hotel Le Toiny in St. Barts, ever popular among the jet set, had a one-bedroom villa with private pool for the equivalent of $2,650 a night available from Dec. 20 to Dec. 29.   Such favorite haunts of the rich aren't offering major deals over the holidays, but some hotels have loosened minimum-stay requirements. Just this month, the Ritz-Carlton Grand Cayman changed its original 10-night minimum for arrivals on Dec. 20 to 24 to just seven nights. Similarly, the Regent Palms, whose charges over the holidays are from $990 for a room to $6,900 for a three-bedroom penthouse, shortened its minimum stay from 10 to seven nights.   Want to spend New Year's in Miami? As of mid-October, the Ritz-Carlton, South Beach had rooms starting at just under $450 a night, if you stayed for at least four nights, a relative bargain for that sun-splashed playground. (One sign the economy isn't totally ruining some people's vacation plans: some other South Beach hot spots, like the Delano, the Shore Club and the new Gansevoort South are totally booked up that week, based on a recent online search.)  A well-connected travel agent is often the first to know about last-minute holiday openings, as resorts will often reach out to them to help fill spots when there is a cancellation. Earlier this month, Island Destinations (www.islanddestinations.com), a luxury tour operator that specializes in access to some of the most desirable accommodations, said several hotels in its collection had some availability for the holidays, including Grace Bay Club in the Turks and Caicos; Caneel Bay, a Rosewood Resort in Virgin Gorda, British Virgin Islands; and Raffles Canouan, the Grenadines. Tablethotels.com was showing availability over Christmas at Bitter End Yacht Club in Virgin Gorda and Strawberry Hill resort  in Jamaica earlier this month.   And Fourseasons.com has a nifty chart that shows up as an option if your first choice is full up, and maps out availability for the ''festive season'' from Dec. 20 to Jan. 5. An X means the hotel is sold out, WL means you can still get on the wait list, and R means there is limited space available. In a recent check, the Four Seasons Costa Rica was sold out but the Four Seasons Great Exuma in the Bahamas still had space, for rooms starting at $735 a night.  If you can't get into your dream resort this holiday season, there's always Spring Break. Valerie Wilson, chief executive of Valerie Wilson Travel in Manhattan, which specializes in high-end destinations, said her well-heeled clients haven't curbed their holiday travel plans so far, but she expects that to change after the New Year. ''I think they're going to be more cautions, and it will be slower,'' she said. ''February, March and April spring breaks -- there is more space for those times.''  The Holidays at Half-Off  The words ''discounts'' and ''holidays'' aren't typically found in the same sentence. But this year, many resorts are feeling the need to slash prices to get travelers to fill rooms. Travelocity.com is offering what it says is the biggest sale in the company's history with 5,000 hotels offering anywhere from 25 to 50 percent off for travel through Jan. 15. ''Higher gas prices over the summer led to lower occupancy rates,'' said Noreen Henry, vice president for hotels at Travelocity. ''Hotels are doing all that they can to make up for it during the fall and holiday travel season, and they're turning to online travel agencies to help them push inventory.''  Earlier this month, Starwood Hotels and  Resorts began offering 50 percent off a second night at nearly 500 hotels in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean for bookings through March. Among the hotels honoring the deal over Christmas: the W Hotel San Diego, the Westin Embassy Row in Washington, and the Hotel Ivy, a Luxury Collection property in downtown Minneapolis.  Some of the best bargains are in popular winter resort destinations like Las Vegas, Florida and the Caribbean, which have already been struggling to lure visitors amid flight cutbacks and rising airfare. Average daily room rates have dropped below the $100 mark over Thanksgiving and Christmas in Las Vegas ($98), Orlando ($84) and Fort Lauderdale ($87), according to Cheaptickets.com. For example, starting rates at Treasure Island in Las Vegas are $79 to $89 a night for Christmas week.    In the Caribbean, where flight cuts and an active hurricane season had curbed demand even before the ***financial crisis** came into play, Elite Island Resorts is offering a bevy of holiday specials, including free meals, lodging and activities for kids staying at the Verandah Resort &amp; Spa on Antigua and summer rates at Christmas at Long Bay Resort and Villas on Tortola, British Virgin Islands, starting at $173 a person based on double occupancy.   ''To have anything available in the Caribbean at Christmas is a real anomaly,'' said Diane McDavitt, president of Luxurylink.com, which offers discounts on high-end hotels and villas through online auctions and special deals. But even this late in the booking season, offers are still coming in. One example: an all-inclusive seven-night stay at St. James's Club in Antigua over Christmas and New Year's was going for $3,802 a night, down from the retail price of $5,432.   If a white Christmas is more your style, check out Ski.com's ''special deals'' section, which lists holiday sales like a fifth night free at Grouse Mountain Lodge in Whitefish, Mont., near Glacier National Park, starting at $584 a person from Dec. 15 to Jan. 1, or four-day lift tickets and five nights at Teton Mountain Lodge in Jackson Hole for the price of four at $1,238 a person.   While hotel deals are plentiful, finding a flight can be a challenge with airlines continuing to cut flights and raise fares. Airline ticket prices are up about 25 percent for Christmas and New Year's, compared with a year ago, according to Farecast.com, which tracks the price of flights.   Avoid the weekend before Christmas, Rick Seaney of Farecompare.com recommends. Instead, fly on the Tuesday before Christmas or on the holiday itself. Consider flying into a major hub airport like Denver or Salt Lake City and then driving to your destination, as such flights are generally less expensive and there are more to choose from. Earlier this month, Ski.com agents were able to find a $328 round-trip flight from Los Angeles to Denver for a trip Dec. 27 to Jan. 1 using this approach. Signing up for fare alerts, which offer a heads-up when airfares drop, will also help when searching for reasonably priced flights.   Go Where the Dollar Is Strong  Despite the flagging confidence in the United States financial system, the dollar has been showing some surprising resilience.  This month the Mexican peso dropped to its weakest level ever against the dollar. The Brazilian real also slumped to its lowest level against the dollar. The Argentine peso, which was already at a favorable exchange rate, dropped about 7 percent since late August to a new five-and-a-half-year low. Even the euro, which had climbed to historic heights, has declined in recent weeks.   For American travelers looking for bargains abroad, the dollar's newfound muscle represents more buying power. In Mexico a 50-minute massage at ME Cancun's sleek Yhi Spa costs 1,432 pesos or about $112 currently, down from about $143 in August when the peso was trading at roughly 10 to the dollar. In Rio de Janeiro, standard rooms at the Arpoador Inn, just east of Ipanema Beach, start at 190 reals or just $91 at 2.12 Brazilian reals to the dollar, down from about $122 in August.   The dollar is up more than 40 percent against the South African rand compared with a year ago, making luxury safaris and Cape Town's high-season hotel rates more affordable. Rooms at the St. James, a seaside Cape Town retreat overlooking Kalk Bay start at 2,600 rand a night in the high season, which means guests would pay about $260 at 10.01 rand to the dollar. A year ago, a room at the same price would have been about $380. Look for last-minute safari deals like the one on CC Africa's offers page, www.safariasap.com, a nine-day adventure visiting the Cradle of Humankind area and the Madikwe Private Game Reserve for 17,748 rand or roughly $1,777, down from 19,778 rand.  Even perennially expensive London is beginning to look more attractive. Two upscale, centrally located hotels in the British capital -- the Metropolitan and the Halkin --  are offering rooms that are almost $:200 off their rack rates when booked online. A City room at the Metropolitan (where you might run into Prince William at the Met Bar) can be reserved for $:169 not including taxes (or about $290 at $1.73 to the pound),  compared with the normal rate of $:375, while a double room at the Halkin is going for $:199, down from around $:390. Details at www.metropolitan.como.bz and www.halkin.como.bz.  Perhaps most dramatically, Iceland, considered among the most expensive countries in Europe, has seen its currency plummet to almost half its value against the dollar in the past year, making Reykjavik look like a pretty good holiday destination for travelers who don't mind the cold.   ''Anything you buy in Iceland is pretty much at half price,'' said Einar Gustavsson, a spokesman for the Iceland Tourist Board.  The devaluation of the krona is making Reykjavik's hotels, once considered prohibitively expensive, more affordable, if not dirt cheap, especially if bought as part of the attractive airline-and-hotel weekend packages now being offered on the Web, some for a total cost of less than $1,000. Check out Special Offers at www.icelandair.com for details.    And if Iceland in winter sounds too cold, consider that one of its more unusual attractions, the Blue Lagoon, the popular geothermally warmed pool just outside the capital, is downright cheap. Admission to the Lagoon is just 2,300 krona (a little over $20 at 112.53 krona to the dollar). (Pay just 15,000 more for access to the ''exclusive bath and lounge'' with private changing rooms, a fireplace and private indoor lagoon.) Meanwhile, Mountain Guides (www.mountainguides.is) is offering a three-hour trek on the Solheimajokull Glacier, including a stop on the way back to see the waterfalls of Skogafoss and Seljalandsfoss. The price is 14,900 krona. (Guides instruct trekkers on how to use necessary ice equipment like crampons.)  Surfing for Bargains  Despite rising airfares, a Hawaiian holiday may be one of the best bargains around for vacation seekers.   The number of airline seats from the mainland to Hawaii is down about 14 percent, largely because of the shutdown of ATA and Aloha Airlines. While the decrease in seats has helped push airfares higher, hotels and tour operators have responded with discounts to help make up the difference.   On average, airfare prices to Honolulu are up $304 for two people traveling Christmas week, according to Farecast.com, which tracks hotel and airline prices, but hotel rates are down by $294, helping to even out the total trip cost.   Just this month the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau initiated a winter vacation campaign to lure visitors to the islands  with prices that are less expensive than last year, officials said. Some of the bargains, which can be found at GoHawaii.com/Value, are good through the first quarter of 2009 and offer a variety of cost-saving air and hotel packages as well as credits for car rentals and airfare. Pleasant Holidays, for example, is offering 50 percent off companion airline tickets from Los Angeles and San Francisco for travel through Feb. 28 with a three-night hotel stay. And Orbitz.com is offering packages for as much as 35 percent off.   Hotel-only deals include seven nights at the Aqua Aloha Surf in Waikiki for just $659 for two people checking in on Dec. 24 and out Dec. 31 from Hawaii Connection (www.hawaiiconnection.com). Starting rates at ResortQuest Kauai Beach at Makaiwa, normally $211 a night during the holidays, have been slashed to $155 a night from Dec. 24 to Jan. 1. All AboutHawaii (www.allabouthawaii.com/specials) is offering a fourth night free and $75 dining credit at the Hilton Waikiki Prince Kuhio or a fifth night free and breakfast at the Pacific Beach Hotel. Hawaii's tourism industry, which largely serves visitors from mainland United States and Japan, is counting on the deals to help lure travelers back. For the first eight months of 2008, total arrivals by air and cruise decreased 8.2 percent from the same period last year, to 4.77 million visitors.   ''We're starting to see the market react, and there is tremendous value out there,'' said John Monahan, president  of the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau. And for travelers looking for an escape from their financial worries, he added, Hawaii ''always had a reputation of being a place people can get away from it all.''   "", 
""An article on Oct. 26 about deals and discounts on hotels and resorts around the world misstated the price for an all-inclusive seven-night stay at the St. James's Club in Antigua over Christmas and New Year's. The price of $3,802 is for the package; it is not the price for one night. "")",1,,,
112,4PH5-R0D0-TX12-N091-00000-00.txt,"c(""Aug. 25--The state Legislature is on the verge of passing yet another trendy bill designed to subsidize alternative fuels (mainly ethanol) at just about the time when sober reflection is causing many initial enthusiasts, including environmentalists, to realize that ethanol is not the magic bullet that will cure addiction to foreign oil and end global warming. The Legislature needs to take a deep breath, put the corn squeezins aside, and reject Assembly Bill 118.This bill, sponsored principally by Speaker Fabian Nunez, would make the California Air Resources Board responsible for setting standards for the reduction of greenhouse gases and subsidize the development and marketing of alternative energy technologies. It would be funded by increasing what is called the Smog Abatement Fee on vehicles older than six years from $12 to $20 a year. It also would increase the basic vehicle registration fee $2 a year (from $31 to $33), increase the cost of obtaining or renewing a driver's license by a dollar, increase the cost of registering a boat by $10 and increase the cost of obtaining a special license plate for construction equipment, farm trailers, cotton trailers and logging trailers by $5.What we have here is a tax on existing vehicles to subsidize technologies that may or may not become practical in time and may or may not contribute to ameliorating global warming and reducing pollution. That's a pretty significant bet that taxpayers would be forced to cover. If it is enacted, the costs we would be forced to bear as consumers could be significantly higher.The bill speaks of alternative and renewable fuels, but everybody knows that means ethanol, so beloved of politicians lately.The fact that corn-producing Iowa is the first stop in the presidential sweepstakes is no doubt merely coincidental.Ethanol no doubt will play a role in the country's energy mix over time, but the only way to find out whether it is a useful role is to let it compete in the marketplace on an equal basis with other fuels. It may be too late for that already. It already receives federal subsidies of 51 cents per gallon in tax credits. Congress is poised to increase mandates and subsidies for ethanol.Adding more subsidies would only tilt the playing field more.In addition, ethanol subsidies and mandates are skewing agricultural markets, to the detriment of consumers. Corn prices have almost doubled over the past year, which mean higher prices for meat, eggs and dairy products, as well as processed foods made with corn-based sweeteners.Iowa State University estimated that the per capita cost of higher corn prices to consumers is $47 more than last year, meaning we're paying about $14 billion for the politicians' ethanol obsession, in addition to $2.7 billion in tax credits. Visionaries speak of cellulosic ethanol made from bio-waste and plants like switch grass, but it's far from commercially feasible yet.Ethanol should compete with other fuels on an even playing field, without subsidies and mandates. The state Legislature can't repeal foolish federal policies (which include a blatantly protectionist tariff on ethanol from Brazil). It can reject AB118, and if it passes, Gov. Schwarzenegger should veto it.To see more of the Appeal-Democrat, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.appeal-democrat.com. Copyright (c) 2007, Appeal-Democrat, Marysville, Calif.

He opened the store in 1955 and, at age 82, still comes in to work on occasion.""I had decided when I was 46 that by the time I was 50 I would move on,"" Wilson added. ""I have been living a retail life for long enough. I am just tired of working six or seven days a week. My whole life revolves around Christmas and Valentine's Day and all the other holidays.""The closure, town Economic Development Assistant Ruth Birtz said, is among several that reflect the ***recession** or the changing face of Lincoln.A scan of real estate listings within the last three weeks showed 21 buildings on Main Street, West Broadway, Airport Road and River Road, the heart of the town's business district, listed for sale at prices ranging from $75,000 to $640,000.Of the 21, four are listed as residential properties. The businesses include a chiropractor, former bank, former hardware store, an auto repairs establishment and a motel. The listings did not indicate whether the businesses had closed or were relocating. A count of all properties along those roads was not available.""This is a difficult time for everybody,"" Birtz said. ""In this area, you are seeing a high unemployment rate, the forest products industry is suffering, and people are being conservative with their money.""Lincoln's unemployment rate in April was 14.8 percent, double the 7.4 percent rate found in April 2008, according to statistics released by the Maine Department of Labor.Yet it would be a mistake to see all recent real estate activity in town as indicative of the ***recession**, Birtz said.Lincoln has an unusually active real estate market for an area with a small population, and several large-scale construction projects are pending, she noted. The recent opening of Health Access Networks' $5.4 million office at 175 West Broadway forced the closure of several smaller doctor's offices around town.Wilson had wanted to sell the store to keep the business going, but found no adequate takers. She still hopes to sell it, she said.J.K. Vose's looming closure struck Chrystal Tash, 29, of Lowell as sad.""This place has been around forever,"" Tash said as she shopped at the store Wednesday.

That's up 11,744 from five years before. Among the other 2007 highlights from economic development presentation: * There were 516 new jobs created in the county last year. * Twelve new major economic development projects were started. * Seven major expansions were launched by local businesses. * About $54 million in new investments were announced. * The economic development department is currently working with 106 prospective businesses. ""We're still seeing very strong interest in Chesterfield,"" Aylward said. She added that the county's top economic priority remains developing major gateways to the county in targeted areas such as the Watkins Centre and Meadowville Technology Park. The chamber's inVision meetings are a series of monthly networking breakfasts held in each of four local large jurisdictions - the counties of Chesterfield, Hanover and Henrico and the city of Richmond. Each session contains a presentation on a topic relevant to each locality. The next inVision Chesterfield will be held May 20 at CJW Medical Center (Johnston-Willis).

Sitting at a transcription machine, she inserts a tape and begins typing what she hears.Recently she was listening to a 1985 interview with Dr. Sue Earnest, a longtime San Diego State University speech professor who died in November 2007 at age 100. Earnest wrote her doctoral thesis on the history of legitimate theater in Southern California, which dates to the Civil War, Hassan said.The society’s research archive in Balboa Park houses the county’s largest and oldest collection of oral history interviews, said Jane Kenealy, the society’s document archivist. The archives hold 1,600 interviews, with about 300 to be transcribed.The oral history program began in 1956. The original goal was to gather the accounts of people who lived in the area in the 1870s and 1880s, Kenealy said.By 1961, more than 300 interviews had been recorded. After a dormant period in the early 1960s, the program was revived and has been continuously active, embracing first-person accounts of longtime residents, as well as work compiled by scholars researching events and personalities.The ***recession** has reduced the number of paid staff members, who train and supervise volunteers such as Hassan. Those reductions, in turn, have led to fewer volunteers.Hassan is the program’s only transcriber. She began volunteering with the society in 2000. She worked on site until two years ago, when she decided she couldn’t continue the daily commute and asked to work from home.She uses a transcription machine on loan from the society and e-mails the completed transcriptions to Kenealy.Hassan, a resident of Rancho Bernardo, honed her transcription skills as a clerical worker. She has also had a lifelong interest in history, which led her to pursue and earn a master’s degree in 1988 in public history at the University of San Diego. The Michigan native also received a bachelor’s degree in business administration there.“I probably would have majored in history if I could have figured out a way to earn a living from it. So I settled for a minor,” she said.After teaching high school for a few years, Hassan moved into the corporate world, working at the offices of General Motors in Flint, Mich. From there she did two tours of duty in U.S. Foreign Service offices in Brazil and Malaysia.She returned to the United States in 1961 and married Charles Hassan, an aerospace engineer. They raised three children in Pennsylvania and later moved to California.Living in Poway in 1980, Hassan went to work at USD. Her master’s thesis on the history of Poway became the basis for a book, “Paguay,” published in 1993 by the Poway Historical and Memorial Society. In a foreword to the book, USD professor James Moriarty credited Hassan with providing “one of (the) seminal foundations for the history of Poway.”Ten years ago, Hassan read a newspaper article about the historical society’s need for transcribers, and she applied.She said she has gained new historical insights from her work with the society. For example, she said she had never known that San Diego had a women’s rowing club until she transcribed interviews with original members of ZLAC.Named for the first initials of four founders, ZLAC is the oldest women’s rowing club in the United States, founded in 1892.She also described interviews with tuna-boat captains, from which she learned of the evolution of tuna fishing from the use of individual rods and lines to purse seines (large nets).All the transcribed interviews are available to researchers at the historical society’s archives in Balboa Park. Some excerpts, in print and other formats, are available on the society’s Web site, sandiegohistory.org.Kenealy said the eventual goal is to post more of the information online.“It’s people like Louhelen who keep the program on focus,” she said.Vincent Rossi is a freelance writer from San Diego.",1,,,

Whatever the reason, November was a much better month for Cape real estate than the same period last year.Real estate sales volume rose dramatically last month in comparison with November 2008, according to statistics from the Barnstable County Registry of Deeds.The registry reported yesterday that year-over-year sales volume rose 46.4 percent in November, with 470 deeds recorded last month.That's up from 321 deeds recorded in November 2008 in the registry's monthly recap, which reflects all sales above $50,000.But Register of Deeds John F. Meade cautioned that last year's numbers were especially weak, coming as credit markets froze and property transfers dropped considerably.\""The music really died at that point,\"" he said.Meade said last month's activity \""is in line with what we've been doing for the last couple of months,\"" but added that he hopes for better performance as the ***recession** winds down.\""We're slowly starting to see our way through, but we're not leaping out of it,\"" he said. November's sales volume is still about 4 percent lower than the same month in 2007.October's monthly sales volume was up 4 percent over 2008.Still, for the Cape real estate market, this fall's improvement has been a boost.\""We've had a huge uptick in the last quarter of the year in all three of our offices,\"" said Matt Weider, president of Century 21 Shoreland Real Estate, which has locations in Hyannis, Harwich and Provincetown.And while sales usually taper off in the fall, this year has been different, said Chris Rhinesmith, broker/owner at Pine Acres Realty in Chatham.\""Things usually tend to settle down in November and through the holidays, but this year, November was a solid month,\"" Rhinesmith said.The $8,000 federal tax credit for first-time home buyers, which was slated to end in November but has been extended and expanded, has played a role in the upswing, Weider said.\""The number of first-time buyers in the area has been remarkable in recent months,\"" he said.Another major factor is confidence that the economy is improving.\""The stock and equity markets tend to drive confidence, and it seems that people are starting to feel better about things,\"" Rhinesmith said.Home pricing also has played a role in last month's better showing.Last spring, there were 80 to 90 homes in the area priced under $200,000, Weider said. Now, there are 20 to 30 homes in that price range.\""With the decline in inventory, those homes are being scooped up much faster,\"" Weider said. \""When those come on the market, they go off almost immediately, and we've got a backlog of buyers.\""He said he's seeing increased sales in homes priced between $200,000 and $300,000.The registry's numbers bear that out, with a median price of $290,000 for November -- down from $297,500 a year before. Monthly median prices this year have ranged from $249,900 in February to $305,000 in June.Weider also said the second-home and condo markets have been stronger this fall.But Meade said that low rates haven't driven mortgage activity as much as he'd expect. \""We're not seeing the surge I'd expect, given the interest rates that are out there,\"" he said.And one factor that continues to stalk the real estate market is unemployment. \""The big unknown is the job market,\"" Weider said.High unemployment plays a part in foreclosures, which are averaging 35 to 40 per month, Meade said. \""The safety valves just aren't there, so if someone loses a job, it's more likely that they'll end up under water on their mortgage -- the equity isn't there like it was before,\"" he said.To see more of the Cape Cod Times, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.capecodonline.com.

Local employment is expected to grow a little more than the 1.5 percent in 2007, as the unemployment rate of 3.2 percent remains flat.The number of unemployment claims in 2007 hovered at some of the lowest levels seen in the past 17 years.\""That does say a lot about the stability of the current economy,\"" said Greg Grootendorst, the economist at the commission who prepared the report. \""We have historically had low unemployment rates in the region.\""In part driven by the steady flow of military spending in the region, the economy tends to avoid the wild swings of many other areas. Without the big ups and downs, the area typically fares relatively well when the nation sees problems with retail, jobs and housing.Hampton Roads retail sales growth is projected to slow a bit to 3.6 percent, and the strong hotel revenue growth of 8.5 percent in 2007 will decline to 4.3 percent. The commission expects the slowdown in new home construction to continue, but at a slower rate than last year.The value of permits given to build new homes declined 16 percent in 2007, and should be down another 8 percent in 2008. Home sales in 2007 continued to slump down to levels last seen in the 1990s, which is also the last time it took as long as it does today to sell a home. Prices remained steady despite the slowdown.The commission didn't make housing predictions, but Grootendorst expects 2008 to be similar to 2007, with prices remaining flat and sellers giving in on things like closing costs.\""The housing market in Hampton Roads is going to be in a period of recovery for awhile,\"" said Grootendorst.The last couple of years have been rough on the region's car dealers, as sales have posted declines. Part of that sales decline was the result of large spending increases the previous two years amid major dealer financing and discounts.

120,4N9D-FNN0-TW8F-G2K2-00000-00.txt,"The Federal Railroad Administration said yesterday that it was speeding up inspection of 1,300 miles of track in New York operated by CSX Transportation after several derailments upstate in recent months.  The agency, which enforces rail safety regulations nationwide, took the step less than a week after a CSX train with several cars carrying liquid propane derailed in Oneida and burst into flames, forcing the evacuation of thousands of residents and the closing of a stretch of the New York Thruway.The inspection was scheduled for next month, but the head of the railroad administration, Joseph H. Boardman, who is a former commissioner of the New York Department of Transportation, ordered it moved up. After tracks in New York are examined, the agency will inspect the rest of the 21,000 miles of track that CSX operates in 23 states around the country, as well as networks operated by other freight rail companies.  ''The Oneida incident convinced me to do this,'' Mr. Boardman said. ''I want to know if the company has put in place the best safety measures. I want to know what their safety culture is.''  In December, the agency proposed a large increase in fines for safety violations to prompt railroads to comply more closely with regulations. A final ruling is expected soon.  CSX could face civil penalties if it is found to have skirted safety regulations. The company, with $9.6 billion in annual sales, paid $1.9 million in penalties to the Federal Railroad Administration last year, 55 percent more than in 2005.  Robert Sullivan, a spokesman for CSX, said his company was cooperating with government inspectors. He noted that train derailments companywide had declined 24 percent last year, and that they were down again this year.  ''We're very focused on safety and having an improving safety record,'' Mr. Sullivan said.  There are a multitude of fines for a multitude of violations, so fines could be heavy although the number of accidents decreased.  Incidents involving all railroads fell 12.4 percent last year to a record low, according to railroad administration statistics.  Still, the accidents in New York have alarmed federal regulators. In Oneida last week, 28 cars -- most of them tankers -- derailed, causing a huge explosion, and the fire was so hot that firefighters could only watch as it burned itself out over several hours.   Mr. Boardman said the agency was also looking into an episode in January in which CSX freight cars fell from an overpass into the front yards of homes in East Rochester. In December, two derailments occurred in Erie and Chautauqua Counties in upstate New York, one of which involved a CSX train.  The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.  In deciding to step up the inspections, Mr. Boardman said he wanted to make sure local emergency service agencies were not overtaxed. In addition to federal inspections, railroads must check their tracks as often as every week.  Several rail experts said that a number of major snowstorms in recent months could have contributed to the incidents along CSX's main route between Albany and Chicago.  ''For as long as railroads have been around, they've had trouble dealing with snow,'' said Daniel McBride, who covers CSX and other industrial companies for H&amp;R Block Financial Advisers.  He said that Burlington Northern, which operates primarily in the western United States, had faced similar problems.  The interruptions in service upstate may have a small effect on CSX's financial performance in the first quarter this year. But CSX and other railroads are more likely to be hurt by a slowdown in demand related to a cooling economy.",0,,,

John Baldacci's proposed school reorganization plan.They complained during a two-hour meeting at Northern Penobscot Tech Region III on Thursday night that Baldacci's plan forced consolidation too quickly upon rural, central Penobscot County towns too sparsely populated and far apart to make the plan feasible.""To just say 'Hey, this is our plan. This is what we're going to do' is absurd. Anything as important as this should be stretched out over the entire year,"" said Wallace Lindahl of Carroll Plantation, a Union 110 school board member.""The state of Vermont did this but they had more than 300 meetings before they got it done. We need to talk a lot more,"" Lindahl added.Six other statewide proposals competing with the governor's plan met similar criticisms. No one spoke favorably of them.Baldacci's plan drew the most scrutiny. Millinocket and Union 113 Superintendent Sara Alberts called it ""one of the most rapid, radical changes in the history of U.S. educational services.""""The governor's plan was dead on arrival the day he announced it,"" Millinocket Town Manager Eugene Conlogue said, calling the plan badly miscalculated. ""All of these plans need more work.""Under Baldacci's plan, RLC-9 would turn a Rhode Island-size area of 30 towns and 10 unorganized territories - including SADs 30, 31, and 67 and Unions 108, 110 and 113 - into a school system of about 3,616 students by July 2008.The new school district would encompass Burlington, Carroll Plantation, Edinburg, Enfield, Glenwood Plantation, Howland, the Katahdin region, Lakeville, Lee, Lincoln, Mattawamkeag, Passadumkeag, Sebois Plantation, Vanceboro, Winn and Woodville.An elected nine-member school board would oversee the district.Baldacci's goal is to consolidate 290 school administrative units into 26 in order to save $240 million statewide, shift resources from administrations to classrooms and eliminate redundant bureaucracies.Officials at the meeting said they found Baldacci's plan wildly unrealistic and biased toward the southern half of the state, where population concentrations make consolidation favorable.A mix of the seven plans will likely pass the Legislature this year to meet the governor's goal of full implementation next year, said state Rep. Jeff Gifford, R-Lincoln.""This is a long ways from being over. Your education committee is probably meeting as we speak. You got some good people on that board and they are working to provide solutions,"" Gifford said. ""Everybody is saying they don't want regionalization and that they don't want the closing down of schools and I don't think that's going to happen.""Others disagreed.""There is no way around it: Schools are going to close,"" said Larry Cowan, Reed Plantation School Committee chairman.Some local regionalization efforts have saved money, said Alberts, who works with three school boards as the superintendent in Katahdin, serving East Millinocket, Medway, Millinocket and Woodville.Starting last year, SADs 30, 31, and 67 and the Katahdin schools combined purchasing for heating oil, paper, bread, milk, boiler maintenance and professional development training, saving a total of at least $60,000 annually, SAD 67 Superintendent Michael Marcinkus said.""It's not a lot, but it's something,"" he said.""There can be efficiency seen regionally, but there's not enough to save the $240 million the governor wants to save, even if it's done all over the state,"" Alberts said.Vast distances between schools, lack of competition among vendors, loss of local control and vastly increased student-teacher ratios are among the pitfalls officials saw in the various school reorganization plans or their own efforts at regionalization.Some plans would have students traveling by bus an hour one way or threaten schools like Lee Academy, whose foreign students bring an estimated $2 million in revenue into the town annually.Yet the officials seemed to accept that Baldacci and the state Department of Education would inevitably force some form of regionalization, and soon. They pledged to fashion a plan best for students and education, not politics and economics.""We are looking at being a region regardless of whether it's everybody here or just some of the people here,"" Marcinkus said.""This is the actual first stage of putting our thoughts together on our commonalties, where can we find things that we can do together and what will work and what will not. Every region will do this,"" Marcinkus added, calling the group's first meeting an achievement.""Who would have thought this would have happened a year ago or five years ago?""",0,,,

It doesn't call for any layoffs of city workers also.At Tuesday's regular meeting, City Manager Bob Boyette talked to the Marion City Council about the proposed budget for next fiscal year. The recommended budget of $9,507,219 is $1,044,256 less than the existing budget for 2008-2009, a drop of 9.9 percent. Boyette said that much of a drop in one year is \""unprecedented\"" for the city's budget.The ***recession** and loss of jobs in Marion have made the situation tough for city government.The proposed budget projects a loss of $366,000 of city sales tax revenue. That is due to the county changing the method of sales tax distribution and declining sales tax revenue from the bad economy.Boyette said the city is also expected to face a loss of $132,851 in revenue because of the closing of the Swift Galey and Spectrum Dyed Yarns plants. All of that means the city will lose about $500,000 in revenue for 2009-2010.Despite the lost money, the city will not raise the property taxes next fiscal year. The rate will stay at 51 cents per $100 valuation. This is the 42nd consecutive year that the city hasn't raised taxes.Boyette added that Marion has seen some modest growth in the property tax base, despite the plant closings.The next fiscal year will be the fourth in a series of annual water and sewer rate hikes. The 6 percent increase for water and sewer rates will bring in an additional $47,000, once revenue losses from the plant closings are factored in.Like the county workers, city employees will not get a salary increase. The proposed budget also calls for six positions to be eliminated but that doesn't mean the city is laying off six workers.\""We hope all that would be done through existing vacancies,\"" said Boyette.Mayor Everette Clark said he hates the fact that the city is not in a position to give raises to its workers.\""But I am glad we can keep our employees,\"" he said. \""They have a job.\""The budget also has reductions in travel and training expenses along with less money for projects and vehicle and equipment replacement.Despite the tight budget, city officials are working on the $6.6 million sewer treatment plant upgrade, the $2 million extension of water and sewer on Sugar Hill Road, the new shelter for the Historic Marion Tailgate Market, a pedestrian plan, the Catawba River greenway, parks for Eastfield and Clinchfield, various sidewalk replacements and extensions, economic development recruiting, a downtown wireless network, upgrades for Oak Grove Cemetery, the Buck Creek watershed and other efforts.Boyette said the city would have a tough time doing many of these projects if it had not gotten grants and raised money from the private sector. Since 2001, Marion has gotten 78 separate grants totaling $12.5 million.\""That has helped keep our property rates and water and sewer rates low,\"" he said.The City Council will hold a workshop meeting on Thursday, May 28 and talk about the proposed budget in more detail.In other business, the Marion City Council:--Agreed to annex the Hampton Inn property on U.S. 221 South into the city limits. It will be taken in as a satellite annexation.--Approved an application submitted by Butch Justice to operate a taxicab service. Justice, who is also a School Board member, will run his taxicab at his U-Haul business on N.C. 226 South. He will take over for Ronnie Patel, who tried to operate a taxicab service a few years ago.--Approved an application for a pool room/game room permit submitted by Carl Woody. He is the new operator of the Good Times Family Fun Center, located in one section of the old Marion Manufacturing plant. However, city officials told Police Chief Mika Elliott they want strict enforcement of the noise ordinance at the business. Clark and other officials said they've gotten repeated complaints from East Marion residents about the noise there. \""It is time for us to put some teeth in this,\"" said Clark.--Reappointed Dudley Thompson to the city's Planning Board and Board of Adjustment. Council also reappointed Jim Isaacs to the ABC Board and Nancy Clark to the Tree Board.--Awarded a contract for the grading and roadbed preparation of dirt roads to Harris Grading of Marion, who turned in a bid of $32,279.

Those much-cited dentists were saying not that sugar-free was good, of course, as much as preferable to regular gum.   Today, however, sugarless brands claim not that they do less harm but untold good. In the last two years, the two dominant gum makers, Cadbury and Wm. Wrigley Jr., a division of Mars, have won approval to carry the American Dental Association seal on several sugarless brands. Chewing gum after eating helps reduce cavities, an A.D.A. statement on packages indicates.  Chewing gums also promise to whiten teeth or kill germs that cause foul breath, and consumers are biting: for the 52 weeks that ended July 12, revenue for sugarless brands -- many of which claim some dental benefit -- rose 6 percent over the previous year, totaling $2.2 billion, according to Information Resources Inc., whose totals exclude sales at Wal-Mart. Sugarless gum -- which now accounts for more than 80 percent of gum sold, compared with 48 percent in 1998 --posted year-over-year growth in each of the last 12 months, despite the financial slowdown.   ''As long as the deep economic ***recession** lasts, millions of Americans will think of saving money on postponed visits to the dentist, every time they select a chewing gum,'' Packaged Facts, a market research firm, said in a recent report.   ''For many years, gum played in the mint category,'' said Doris Tancredi, a vice president in Cadbury's science division. ''But now the oral care segment is clearly outpacing the overall category.''  In a commercial for Trident Xtra Care by the JWT unit of WPP that was shown earlier this year, a man in a library discreetly slips a piece of gum in his mouth, only to have his teeth start loudly singing ''thank you.'' A voice-over explains that the gum contains Recaldent, which ''strengthens tooth enamel to help prevent cavities.''  Beginning this September, the brand, which was introduced in 2008, will distribute four million sample packs through dentists, hoping Novocain-numbed patients will view the gum in the same cavity-fighting light as the free toothbrushes and toothpaste dentists hand out.  In 2001 the company introduced Trident White, which, along with Wrigley's Orbit White, is among the 10 best selling sugarless gums. While the target demographic for sugarless gum typically has been 18- to 34-year-olds, Ms. Tancredi said the company was now focusing on older Americans with its ''wellness agenda,'' which also pitches gum as a diet aid for ''snack avoidance.''   Wrigley, whose Orbit brand carries the dental association seal and tops the sugarless gum category, also aims at dieters. The company's Extra brand has sponsored ''The Biggest Loser,'' the weight-loss reality show on NBC, for four seasons, enjoying prominent placement, like a coach holding up a pack and recommending it by name to contestants.  Wrigley, which declined interview requests, provided a statement saying that for ''more than 25 years, Wrigley has pioneered independent, clinical research to support the oral health care benefits of chewing sugar-free gum,'' adding that it projects ''significant growth opportunities in wellness and oral care.''  The company formed the Wrigley Science Institute in 2005 to help underscore ''the benefits of chewing,'' a trademarked term. Some research has more validity than other efforts, with studies suggesting that gum helps in areas like oral health, dieting, stress relief and focus and concentration; one study even suggested that chewing gum helped adolescents improve standardized math test scores. (''Research conducted in the area of chewing gum and cognitive performance is complex,'' Wrigley says in a typical caveat on its Web site, ''but results are emerging on a number of fronts that may point us toward a better understanding.'')  Rather than crediting some special ingredient, the dental association's statement on gum labels says simply that ''the physical action of chewing'' gum for 20 minutes after eating ''stimulates saliva flow, which helps to prevent cavities by reducing plaque acids and strengthening teeth.'' Saliva has naturally occurring calcium and phosphate, which strengthen tooth enamel.  Brands that make the boldest dental claims do not carry the dental association's seal, because they have not applied for it, which would require submitting scientific verification. Neither Trident White nor Orbit White carries the seal, though both Wrigley and Cadbury say their studies demonstrate efficacy.   Wrigley's Eclipse, which brags of ''natural germ killing'' properties because it contains magnolia bark extract, or M.B.E., and Trident Xtra Care, with its professed strengthener Recaldent, also lack the dental association's stamp. Concerning those brands, in fact, Wrigley and Cadbury have accused one another of overblown claims, filing challenges with the National Advertising Division of the Better Business Bureaus.   Concerning the complaint against Eclipse, the advertising panel ruled in April that the brand's ''germ killing'' claim should be ''discontinued or modified to indicate that there is emerging evidence as to M.B.E.'s germ-killing capability without expressly or by implication communicating that there is credible scientific evidence that the gum has been proven to kill the germs that cause bad breath.'' Wrigley filed an appeal, which has yet to be heard.  As for Trident Xtra Care, when Cadbury declined to participate in the inquiry in October 2008, the Better Business Bureau panel referred the matter to the Federal Trade Commission, which has not yet issued a ruling. (Both companies declined to comment on the proceedings.)  Whether brands dial down claims or not, though, dental benefits are likely to remain a selling point. Packaged Facts predicts that sales of gums that make oral health claims  will increase nearly 40 percent by 2014 over 2008.",0,,,

But the slowdown is largely driven by consumers, abetted by an upheaval in housing plus rising energy and other costs.If ***recession** strikes, the most intense pain likely will be felt in retail, restaurants, construction and real estate -- the very sectors where a growing number of North Carolinians work.Since the ***recession** in 2001, those industries have added about 131,000 jobs in North Carolina. Collectively, their rolls have grown almost twice as fast as total employment in the state. And they account for about 25 percent of Triangle jobs.\""You're going to see a bloodbath,\"" said George McNeill, who owns the Pharaoh's restaurant chain in Raleigh. He has put expansion on hold and expects little or no growth for the next year.Economists are divided on whether a ***recession** will occur. If it does, this area could be spared the worst.In the Triangle, unemployment has stayed below the state average. And North Carolina itself is among 13 states with the healthiest economies, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.What's more, the housing market has benefited from population gains. While figures point to a slowdown both in North Carolina and the Triangle -- sales of existing homes in this region declined last year for the first time in five -- it has been more muted than in other states and markets.\""North Carolina has entered this with more growth and momentum than the rest of the country,\"" said Matt Martin, an economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. \""The U.S., conceivably, could go into ***recession** and North Carolina may not.\""A domino effectThe last ***recession** lasted eight months and deeply scarred the Triangle.During that period, businesses slashed technology spending and prompted large employers such as Nortel Networks, Cisco Systems and MCI, now a division of Verizon, to eliminate thousands of jobs. That caused shockwaves in this region that outlasted the downturn. In 2002, for instance, Triangle foreclosure filings increased 42 percent. In 2003, they jumped another 28 percent.Meanwhile, the state's manufacturing sector was thrown into chaos as imports increased.It took North Carolina almost five years -- from March 2001 to January 2006 -- to push unemployment back below 5 percent.This time, manufacturing, which still accounts for a fifth of the state's economy, is better positioned. The dollar is the weakest in years against foreign currencies, and U.S.-made goods are cheaper than those produced in some other countries.That has helped spark an uptick in exports. Business investment, too, has stayed solid.The question is: Will the trends continue?Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the economy, but consumer confidence dropped sharply in January, the Conference Board reported Tuesday. If business executives see a prolonged decline, they might delay equipment upgrades or expansions. That would hurt job growth and exacerbate economic problems.Executives with Raleigh-based Global Software, which sells computer programs to businesses, do not foresee a slackoff.\""We're full steam ahead,\"" said Spencer Kupferman, vice president of corporate affairs at the 80-employee company. Sales rose 20 percent last year, and he expects the same in 2008.The company expects to add four workers within the next two months, in keeping with a broader trend. As of December, technology employers in the state had almost 4,000 open positions, according to the N.C. Technology Association, underscoring the health of business spending.Guarding our walletsThis downturn was triggered by the national slowdown in housing and tightening in credit markets. No longer able to use their homes as piggy banks, consumers have cut purchases.The effects, combined with rising gas prices and higher food costs, have rippled through the economy. Retail sales have fallen. People are eating out less. And just about anybody connected with the housing industry -- from construction workers to furniture makers -- has felt pain.Even McDonald's is suffering. On Monday, the fast-food chain said sales were flat last month.Pricey noodlesIn Raleigh, the Italian restaurant 518 West is getting socked by the price of a crucial ingredient: noodles. The cost of pasta has doubled since the beginning of December. 518 West has not raised prices.\""It's made management more difficult, and just trying to control the costs,\"" said Blaine Nierman, 518's general manager.McNeill, owner of Pharaoh's restaurants, foresees sluggishness for at least a year. At best, he expects sales growth of 3 percent after logging 25 percent gains in recent years. He has told employees at his three locations to expect smaller raises than he gave in 2007. He called off plans for three more spots.\""My profits shrink every day,\"" he said.Retailers, coming off the worst holiday season in five years, are also trimming costs. Chains are closing stores, including the Talbots Kids and Mens stores in Raleigh's Cameron Village and Talbots Kids at The Streets at Southpoint in Durham.Other retailers are running sales and promotions. Julie Jennings, owner of Uniquities boutique, which has three Triangle stores, sent her managers to New York this week to see how things are done there.\""We're trying to put our money into staff and into training, and making sure we're on top of our game when customers come in,\"" Jennings said. She's been in business for 16 years and said that traffic has fallen off recently.\""You've got to do what you can do,\"" she said. \""It's going to be challenging.\""jonathan.cox@newsobserver.com or (919) 836-4948To see more of The News &amp; Observer, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.newsobserver.com.

127,4V64-D8X0-TX33-C0DM-00000-00.txt,"WASHINGTON -- President-elect Barack Obama and congressional Democrats have entered discussions over an economic stimulus package that could grow to include $850 billion in new spending and tax cuts over the next two years, a gigantic sum that some Democrats say could prove difficult to push rapidly through Congress.A package of that size -- which would include at least $100 billion for cash-strapped state governments and more than $350 billion for investments in infrastructure, alternative energy and other priorities -- is a significant increase over the numbers previously contemplated by Democrats. It would exceed the $700 billion bailout of the U.S. financial system, as well as the annual budget for the Pentagon.The potential for massive new spending has touched off a frenzy among interest groups eager to claim their share of the expanding stimulus pie. The profusion of requests from governors, transportation groups, environmental activists and business organizations is spawning fears that the package could be loaded with provisions that satisfy important Democratic constituencies, but fail to provide the jolt needed to pull the nation out of a deepening ***recession**.""It's everybody's wish list, everybody's favorite program. And I think that's a big mistake,"" said Brookings Institution economist Alice Rivlin, budget director for former President Bill Clinton, who has been advising Democrats. ""I agree with the Obama team that we need a big increase in public investment, but it should be done very, very wisely,"" rather than through a rushed process that risks being ""seen as scattering money to the wind.""An Obama adviser involved in crafting the stimulus package said the transition team was keenly aware of the potential pitfalls and was focused on funding ideas that would quickly pump money into the sagging economy, fulfilling Mr. Obama's promise to create or preserve 2.5 million jobs by 2011. Because many ideas probably won't meet that standard, the adviser said, the team is developing a screen to keep them out.Obama economic adviser Jason Furman and congressional liaison Phil Schiliro met Thursday on Capitol Hill with key congressional staff to lay out the plan that Mr. Obama expects to present to lawmakers. According to notes taken by a participant and shared by a senior congressional aide on the condition of anonymity, the pair said Mr. Obama is putting together a package of $670 billion to $770 billion, but that he expects additions by Congress to jack up the total to about $850 billion, or 6 percent of the nation's economy.While that figure is larger than any previously discussed by Democratic leaders, it is within the range of recommendations from economists. Some, such as Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, have called on the government to spend as much as $1 trillion to combat rising unemployment and spur economic activity.Mr. Furman and Mr. Schiliro said the package would include $100 billion to help states cover the expanding cost of Medicaid, the federal health program for the poor. With more than half of states reporting budget shortfalls this year, the package also could include big increases in state block grants and other programs intended to help local governments avoid layoffs or tax increases.At least $350 billion would be devoted to investments, including public works projects such as roads and bridges. That category also would cover funding for alternative energy, health-care technology, school modernization and ""protecting the most vulnerable"" by expanding unemployment insurance and food-stamp benefits, according to a memo sent Thursday to Senate Democrats by the chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., as well as other congressional aides.Mr. Obama also expects to include significant new tax cuts for the middle class, probably modeled on his campaign promise to lower the tax burden on workers, students, the elderly and families. The package could also include his proposal to offer tax credits to companies that create jobs, according to sources.Congressional aides said Mr. Obama is soliciting additional ideas from lawmakers with the aim of building support for a package that he hopes will be ready for him to sign soon after he takes office Jan. 20. In Thursday's meeting, however, Mr. Furman and Mr. Schiliro acknowledged that Jan. 30 may be a more realistic goal. But even that date may be optimistic for a package of the magnitude under discussion.Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, incoming chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Thursday that there was no agreement on the size of the package, adding that he is skeptical of reports that it could approach $1 trillion. ""We're a country that's used to saying 'a million' or 'billion'. 'Trillion' is something that's very seldomly used,"" Mr. Inouye said.The $850 billion figure is also meeting resistance from House Democrats, who say anything beyond the $600 billion that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has mentioned would probably lose votes among fiscally conservative Democrats known as Blue Dogs.Concerns about the political viability of the package are compounded by fears that its economic effectiveness could be diluted. Ms. Rivlin said she would prefer quick approval of a much smaller package that contains only items that would rapidly push cash into the economy, such as aid to states and the poor and perhaps a payroll tax holiday. That could be followed, she said, by a larger spending package with investments thoughtfully crafted to achieve Mr. Obama's broader economic goals.""Mass transit, the high-tech stuff, investment in health IT. Those are all good ideas,"" Ms. Rivlin said. ""But they aren't stimulus.""",1,,,

Sources familiar with the project said it could be unveiled before the end of the year.  Other publishing companies, including Hearst and Condé Nast, are also looking at the concept, according to tech Web site All Things Digital, which broke the news yesterday.  That may explain why Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes said yesterday that, contrary to speculation, he plans to keep his magazine group, which generates about $4.5 billion a year in revenue but has been hit by the ad ***recession**.  ""Time Inc.is not for sale,"" Bewkes told an interviewer at an Atlantic magazine-sponsored conference in Washington DC, AOL's Daily Finance site first reported. ""People made these rumors because they want a lot of activity.""  Asked if Time Warner would be in the magazine business in five years, he responded in the affirmative. ""Yeah and I think the magazine business has plenty of expansion in it.""  Time Inc.Executive Vice President John Squires is said to be developing the digital project, described by one knowledgeable source as ""an iTunes store for magazines.""  The insider said that the venture would not involve going into the hardware business but would be ""agnostic in terms of hardware.""  That also means Moore would have to convince Jeff Bezos to let the magazine system onto Amazon's Kindle, and Steve Jobs to open up his as-yet-unnamed e-reader.  Squires once headed the division that included Time, Fortune and Sports Illustrated, but in June Time Inc.CEO Ann Moore put him in charge of a task force to study electronic publishing.  While Time Inc.is clearly searching for answers, Bewkes' comments are not likely to quell all speculation about Time Inc.'s future.  More than a year ago, a Mexican entrepreneur approached the company about buying Southern Progress. The deal fell apart when the credit markets began unraveling and the buyer had trouble with financing.  Some insiders said the portfolio is ""under review.""

129,4VDR-W310-TWDH-N1MW-00000-00.txt,"c(""VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN "", ""Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. steps into his new job as a senator's senator - steeped in the culture of the Capitol and deeply respectful of its role in Washington's intricate balance of power. There couldn't be a more fitting backdrop than the Capitol dome today when he is sworn in as vice president.The Senate has defined Biden's professional life since 1972, when at age 29 he bucked President Richard M. Nixon's re-election landslide and edged GOP incumbent J. Caleb Boggsto capture the Delaware seat.Tragedy struck weeks later when Biden's wife Neilia and infant daughter Naomi were killed in a car accident and his two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were critically injured. Biden was sworn into the Senate at the boys' hospital bedside, but the young father spoke openly of suicide and considered resigning the seat he had just won.No less than Nixon, in an awkward sympathy call after the accident, urged Biden to soldier on.\""Look ... at it as you must, in terms of your future. Because you have the great fortune of being young,\"" the president told the grief-stricken Biden.Biden did choose to stay in the Senate, forging a 35-year career. Today, Biden takes the next step in his political life by becoming the nation's 47th vice president.Though Biden has spent his professional life in the nation's capital, he isn't a typical creature of Washington.As a single father caring for his sons, Biden early on began a regular commute between Washington and Wilmington, Del., riding the Amtrak trains. The nightly trek home helped burnish the image of a middle-class everyman - Biden often could be found at Home Depot on a Saturday morning. That image has endured despite his lengthy tenure on Capitol Hill.His second wife, Jill, is a professor at Delaware Technical and Community College and has spent little time in Washington.Despite his strong ties to his home state, Biden's public identity has been honed in the elite confines of the Senate. So has his sometimes windy speaking style, a trademark that has gotten him in hot water at times.He made headlines late in the campaign when he told supporters that Barack Obama would face an international crisis early in his presidency, designed to \""test the mettle of this guy.\""And this month, he openly criticized the Obama transition team for failing to consult the Senate Intelligence Committee on Obama's choice of Leon Panetta to head the CIA.\""I'm still a Senate man and I always think this way,\"" Biden said.RESPECTED VOICELongtime friends say Biden's loose-lipped reputation is overblown.\""He is direct, he does try and say what he thinks. I think that's one of the reasons Barack picked him,\"" said Larry Rasky, Biden's longtime political adviser. \""He knows he will have an honest partner who will sit across the table from him without guile or motive.\""Biden long has been a respected voice on foreign policy in the Senate. He also distinguished himself as a member of the Judiciary Committee, crafting the landmark Violence Against Women Act and legislation to create the Office of National Drug Control Policy.Biden became recognizable to television viewers in 1987, while presiding over the controversial Judiciary Committee hearings on President Ronald Reagan's failed nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. In 1991, he similarly was visible leading the explosive confirmation hearings for President George Bush's Supreme Court pick, Clarence Thomas, who faced Anita Hill's accusations of sexual harassment.Biden's first run for president collapsed in 1987 after he acknowledged plagiarizing material from speeches delivered by British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock. Shortly thereafter, Biden had several surgeries for life-threatening brain aneurysms that kept him out of the Senate for seven months.He ran again for the Democratic nomination last year, getting off to a rough start when he was forced to explain his description of Obama as \""clean\"" and \""articulate\"" on day one of his campaign. Biden dropped out of the race early after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses. But his sharp, witty performances in several nationally televised debates drew the notice of Obama's team in the search for a running mate.In Biden, Obama's aides believe they found the right combination of legislative leadership and everyman appeal that will help to move Obama's plans on Capitol Hill and in the public square.\""Joe Biden has served under seven administrations. He's seen what works and what doesn't work - that's the value of having him,\"" Obama's senior adviser David Axelrod said. \""He brings a wealth of experience not just on issues of substance but also how to best get things done.\""DIFFERENT APPROACHBiden doesn't think much of the way Dick Cheney handled the vice presidency.On a procedural level, he has vowed not to blur the lines between the executive and legislative branches the way his predecessor sometimes seemed to.Cheney was a frequent presence at weekly Senate GOP conference meetings and had an office just off the House floor, all part of the unusual level of political independence he maintained under President George W. Bush. Biden and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., have agreed that Biden will not attend the weekly Democratic caucus meetings.On broader issues, Biden regularly denounced Cheney on the campaign trail, calling him the most dangerous vice president in history. And in interviews since the election, he has continued to criticize Cheney for his handling of the job.\""I think the recommendations, the advice that he has given to President Bush ... has been not healthy for our foreign policy, not healthy for our national security, and it has not been consistent with our Constitution, in my view,\"" Biden said on ABC's \""This Week.\""Cheney recently snapped back at Biden's criticism. \""If he wants to diminish the office of the vice president, that's obviously his call,\"" Cheney told Fox News.Biden has characterized his new role as one of presidential counselor, to advise Obama on a broad portfolio of issues. He did have certain requirements for the job that he shared with Obama.\""I want a commitment from you that in every important decision you'll make, every critical decision, economic and political as well as foreign policy, I'll get to be in the room,\"" Biden said he told Obama.Obama is said to have made good on the promise, consulting Biden on Cabinet choices and seeking input in crafting a nearly trillion-dollar economic stimulus package.Axelrod declined to say whether Obama had openly rejected the Cheney vice presidential model when choosing Biden as his running mate, but he said Obama had a strong view on how the job should work.\""There was a recognition that there's a president and a vice president and the president sets the direction of the administration,\"" Axelrod said. \""The vice president can influence that in his discussions. Once set, the job of vice president is to help execute that.\""Obama also has asked Biden to chair a newly created task force aimed at making sure the administration's economic policies would benefit the middle class.SUPPORTING ROLEAfter decades of a well-established routine in Washington and Delaware, Biden's life is set to change dramatically.Besides leaving the Senate, he and his wife will move from Wilmington into the vice presidential mansion at the Naval Observatory in Washington. Jill Biden has said she hopes to continue teaching, in the Washington area.The Bidens are said to look forward to living close to their son Hunter, 38, a Washington lawyer, and his family.The Bidens' son Beau, 39, Delaware's attorney general, is on a yearlong tour of Iraq as part of the state's National Guard and is expected to run for his father's Senate seat when he returns. Daughter Ashley, 27, is a social worker in Delaware.After Biden's career as his own boss, some of his friends have wondered how he will adjust to a supporting role. Aides say he's handling it well and willingly has relinquished the independence of his old life for the influence his new job confers.\""I think he's completely at peace and very enthusiastic about the possibilities,\"" said John Marttila, a friend and political consultant who has worked with Biden since his first Senate race in 1972.""

It also required engineering reviews for traffic and drainage.An extension was necessary to prepare the reviews.Michael said the construction plans also needed to be revised to show the state Department of Environmental Protection that the Eastern box turtle on the site would have a safe place to migrate.When an application for Chelsea Heights was first submitted in 2005, residents in the nearby Wooster Woods development were worried about the project, especially the amount of traffic it would generate on Apollo Road -- the access to Chelsea Heights -- and the large amount of excavation needed on the rocky hillside.Among the changes developers made to the original plans was to move the entrance to Chelsea Heights so the amount of ledge to be cut was reduced.Contact Marietta Homayonpour at mhomayonpour@newstimes.com or at (203) 731-3336.WHAT: Developers for Chelsea Heights, an approved 238-unit housing project, are asking Bethel for a one-year extension to begin construction.WHY: The country's ***economic downturn**To see more of The News-Times or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.newstimes.com/.

131,7WKV-W120-Y8TC-S09S-00000-00.txt,"There's a lot to appreciate in the latest incarnation of the Democrats' Sisyphean-like campaign to overhaul the nation's health care system. In the current environment, matters are growing worse almost by the hour.  Horrendous job losses and an economy that is in shambles are driving up the number of people without health insurance. ''Every day,'' said President Obama in his speech to Congress this week, ''14,000 Americans lose their coverage.''  This is occurring at the same time that the immense baby boomer generation is approaching retirement age, the age when even under the best of circumstances the need for health care steadily rises.  Even those with health insurance frequently find themselves on shaky ground, worried that they will lose it if they lose their jobs or that the coverage will not meet their real-world needs.  So most Americans are prepared to listen when the Democrats try to make the case for changes that would, among other things, prevent insurance companies from denying coverage because of pre-existing conditions, prevent them from engaging in the perverse practice of canceling policies when the policyholder gets ill, put an end to arbitrary caps on annual or lifetime coverage and limit what policyholders could be charged for deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses.  When you factor in the explosive costs of health care, which are making American businesses less competitive and threatening to bankrupt the government, the case for reform would seem to be a slam dunk.  But there's a wild card out there undermining the chances for real reform, and it's not the crazies who have been disrupting health care forums or the disrespectful space cadet legislators like the South Carolina Congressman Joe (''You lie!'') Wilson. It's the ordinary working men and women of America who are struggling with the worst ***economic downturn** they have ever seen and who are worried that the big new plans that the Democrats have in store may not be in their best interests --  and may not be affordable.  Many of those folks already have health insurance, and many voted for Barack Obama. But they're scared to death now as the economy continues to hemorrhage jobs and the budget deficits unfolding before their eyes are being counted in the trillions.  To get meaningful health care reform this time around, the Democrats will have to get that constituency on board. They haven't yet.  For one thing, the various proposals are not at all clear to the general public and the average citizen is clueless as to how any of them would be paid for. To say that people are skeptical is the grossest understatement.  When the administration talks about getting hundreds of billions of dollars in savings from Medicare to help finance health care reform, it sends a shudder not just through Medicare recipients (who like their coverage just fine and don't want anyone tampering with it), but also through younger individuals concerned about elderly relatives on Medicare.  The president said in his speech that the savings would come from eliminating ''hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and fraud'' and the elimination of some unwarranted subsidies. But to the finely tuned ear of the general public, that's exactly what politicians always say: We're going to get rid of waste and fraud.The administration would contend that this time will be different. One can understand why some will remain unconvinced.  The president also said, as he estimated the cost of his proposal at $900 billion over 10 years, that he ''will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits  --  either now or in the future.''  I'm sure he means it. But I have not spoken to anyone, either on Capitol Hill or elsewhere, who believes that is doable. Now it may be that the public should not be so worried about the deficits. They had to be jacked up to get the country through this terrible ***economic crisis**. And health care reform  --  real reform  --  is essential if long-term deficits are to be brought under control.  But people are worried about it. And just saying that health care reform will not add to the deficits is not enough to allay those fears.  What's missing from all the talk about reform is how the runaway costs of health care, and all the dire consequences associated with them, can be reined in without a strong public insurance option and other big-time cost-saving initiatives.  If the government requires everyone  --  or nearly everyone  --  to have health insurance, the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry will reap a bonanza. What the Democrats still have to make clear to ordinary working men and women is how this latest incarnation of health care reform will be cost effective and broadly beneficial to them and to their government.

They contribute time and money to schools, community fairs, park programs, block parties and more.The ***recession** that started last year prompted a drop in civic involvement in Minnesota and the rest of the nation. But Minnesota responded differently to the ***economic downturn**.Fifty-nine percent of Minnesotans cut back on volunteering last year; nationally the figure was 72 percent.And 41 percent of Minnesotans said they volunteered more, compared to 28 percent for the nation as a whole.Boyte said another promising development in Minnesota is a movement to make education the responsibility of the whole community, not just professional educators.\""The country can turn to Minnesota to learn,\"" said David Smith, executive director of the National Conference on Citizenship.To see more of the Pioneer Press, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.twincities.com.

Typical customers will receive refunds between $10 and $25. The refund will be shown as a credit on bills in March.But of even more benefit to pocketbooks will be the natural gas rates that are down 20 percent, thanks to a large supply and an mild winter.Minnesota Energy Resources has plenty of natural gas in storage that had been purchased during the summer when prices were low, the company said. Not only that, but the ***economic slowdown** has cut down on businesses' demand, resulting in a decline in natural gas use in 2009, it said.Finally, this year has had little hurricane activity; tropical storms can damage production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico and increase prices.Minnesota Energy Resources, a subsidiary of Rosemount, Minn.,-based Integrys Energy Group, provides natural gas to customers in Rochester and most of southeastern Minnesota.To see more of the Post-Bulletin, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.postbulletin.com.

134,7V13-WSX0-Y8YF-Y03B-00000-00.txt,"WASHINGTON - Less than one month after President Obama took office, Congress on Friday night passed his flagship proposal, a massive $787 billion economic stimulus bill.The Senate late in the night approved the measure 60-38 with three GOP moderates providing crucial support. Hours earlier, the House vote was 246-183.The day was filled with the same partisan rancor that has dogged the bill over the last three weeks.Supporters said the measure would save or create 3.5 million jobs. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer conceded there was no guarantee, but he said that ""millions and millions and millions of people will be helped, as they have lost their jobs and can't put food on the table of their families.""Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis, called the legislation ""the most significant jobs bill in American history.""This legislation will help us create and protect 3 to 4 million American jobs. At least 69,000 of those jobs will be in Missouri. The bill also invests almost $1 billion in infrastructure projects across our state, many of them critical to public safety and job creation.""Vigorously disagreeing, House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio dumped a copy of the 1,071-page bill to the floor in a gesture of contempt. ""The bill that was about jobs, jobs, jobs has turned into a bill that's about spending, spending, spending,"" he said.Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., complained that some of the spending won't occur for a decade. ""I hope this ***recession** is over by then but, because of this package, I'm afraid we could prolong our economic woes by forcing Americans who need loans to purchase homes or send their children to college to compete with the federal government,"" he said, referring to the nation's long-term indebtedness.Obama failed to obtain the wide bipartisan support he had sought. No Republicans voted for the bill in the House on Friday, and just three - Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania - supported it in the Senate.Republicans heaped particular criticism on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.""It's a one-party bill,"" said Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia, the Republican whip, after the bill passed in the House. ""We weren't allowed to write one word of this bill.""Obama met with leaders of both parties at the White House and in a trip to Capitol Hill, and he increased the share of the package devoted to tax cuts in an effort to lure GOP support. But many congressional Democrats were reluctant to make further concessions, and it appeared that the GOP had made a strategic decision to stand fast against the bill.The Republicans' near-total opposition presages even harder fights to come on health care reform, new aid to banks and other major issues on the president's agenda.The bill was officially listed at $787 billion Friday, $2 billion smaller than the estimate from the day before. In spending bills such as this one, the Congressional Budget Office routinely redraws its estimates of the bill's overall cost based on its analysis of the final language.Many people should see more money in their pockets soon, as a result of tax cuts designed to reduce withholding and fatten take-home pay. It also features a bevy of tax cuts to leave more money in the hands of businesses.The bill also provides billions of dollars for infrastructure repair, school renovations, aid for cash-strapped states and help for the unemployed in the form of health care subsidies and extensions of unemployment benefits.",1,,,
135,4R47-7TX0-TWJ5-7146-00000-00.txt,"Proteomics, biomarkers and neurogenetics may not ever be the stuff of breakfast table conversation in eastern Maine, but boosters of a new scientific institute based in Brewer say the region can expect a gradual awakening of its biomedical research vocabulary.That's what has happened in Greater Portland, where the Maine Medical Center Research Institute, or MMCRI, has become an important part of the regional economy and a cornerstone of biomedical research in New England.Bangor-area residents curious about the evolution of the Maine Institute for Human Genetics and Health - an affiliate of Eastern Maine Healthcare Systems in partnership with The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor and the University of Maine in Orono - can expect the Brewer lab to take a cue from its successful southern Maine counterpart.Success in ScarboroughAdministratively, MMCRI is a department of Maine Medical Center in Portland, the state's largest hospital. Although its presence and impact in the Portland area has grown rapidly over the past decade, director Kenneth Ault said in a recent interview that the research program has evolved gradually over more than a half-century. Physicians at MMC have engaged in research since the 1950s, he said, using human patients as well as mice and other methods to test the effectiveness of innovations in cardiovascular care and the treatment of kidney dysfunction.In the late 1950s a formal research institution was proposed. But the political and financial climate wasn't right, and ""the whole thing just kind of fizzled,"" Ault said. About 20 years ago the idea was raised again and this time MMC board members and others in the community got solidly behind the project and made a long-term commitment to fund it.Though it was another 10 years before the freestanding lab was constructed in Scarborough, recruiting began early on for researchers with the experience and clout to attract significant research funding from the National Institutes of Health and other sources.Initially, scientists were provided with make-do lab space at the hospital. But as their numbers grew, their work built up momentum and their funding became established, plans for the new lab facility began to develop.In 1997, the freestanding MMCRI facility opened for business, boasting top-of-the-line equipment and state-of-the-art laboratories. The $13 million project was paid for with a combination of hospital reserves and an intensive fundraising effort.On the hospital's grassy Scarborough campus, just a couple minutes' drive off Interstate 295, the two-story brick research facility now houses 16 full-time senior scientists, each with at least a half-dozen research assistants and other staff. In the climate-controlled basement, thousands of specially bred mice are raised for use in experiments.   Including scientists and their assistants, administrative staff, mouse handlers, maintenance workers and other employees, the lab employs about 150 people, with an average annual salary of about $57,000. Even the lower-level positions require some specialized training, which is provided by the facility. Science and the communityMMCRI scientists are engaged in a number of research areas. Two broad categories of investigation are angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, and stem cell biology, which seeks to understand the mechanisms and therapeutic uses of these ""blank-slate"" structures.More specifically, researchers there have been successful at directing mouse stem cells to grow into cardiac blood vessels which could someday be used in treating human heart disease. Other scientists are studying a recently identified protein that regulates the growth of stem cells. Another protein element is being studied for its ability to treat iron deficiency in renal disease and after chemotherapy. Some research is directed at regulating blood vessel inflammation, thought to be the basis for many human diseases.Together the researchers at MMCRI pull down about $15 million in research funding each year from NIH and other organizations. Their annual salaries range from $150,000 to $170,000.In addition to the full-time scientists employed by the lab, MMCRI provides space and support to practicing physicians in southern Maine who want to conduct their own research. It also hosts undergraduate and graduate college students who want to experience a professional research setting, and offers a summer program for high school students.Researchers collaborate with colleagues at The Jackson Lab as well as with faculty and students at the University of Maine, the University of Vermont, Dartmouth Medical School and the University of New England School of Osteopathic Medicine in Biddeford.In addition to the lab itself, MMCRI has attracted a number of ""spinoff"" businesses to southern Maine - companies and organizations that support the work of the lab or build on the information it generates.First things firstMMCRI may have set an enviable standard for biomedical research in the state, but supporters of a similar project in eastern Maine caution that it will take time to develop the same level of activity and visibility here.Janet Hock is the director and the principal investigator at the fledgling Maine Institute for Human Genetics and Health. Though the institute's mailing address is at the corporate headquarters of Eastern Maine Healthcare Systems in Brewer, for now Hock is working out of make-do quarters at The Jackson Lab.In a recent interview, she said she's ""a happy camper,"" despite scaled-back plans to build the state-of-the-art research facility in Brewer.With Mainers suffering from higher-than-average levels of cancer and chronic disorders such as heart disease and diabetes - and with research dollars available for studies that bring promising laboratory results to the bedsides of human patients - Hock said the time is right for eastern Maine to grow its own research program.Hock's immediate priority is to continue recruiting top-shelf scientists. Once there's enough buzz - a stable group of researchers running multiple studies with reliable funding from prominent sources - the new bricks-and-mortar laboratory will take shape, she said.Challenges for BrewerWhile the Brewer project has the support of Maine's research community, Ault said, it faces significant obstacles.For one thing, ""they're starting more from scratch"" than MMCRI did, he said. Although Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor has supported physician research for many years, the program there has been low-profile and lacks the momentum that was present when MMCRI got serious about a stand-alone presence, he said.The project is also hindered by its distance from Boston, Ault said. Finding researchers willing to forgo the career benefits of a major academic center in favor of the more isolated environs of eastern Maine will likely be an even greater challenge than it has been for MMCRI, which is just two hours by car from Boston and is served daily by reliable bus, plane and train service.Finally, Ault said, at MMCRI ""the research mission is part of the hospital mission. That's certainly true here - and I trust it is there [at the Maine Institute for Human Genetics and Health], as well.""""You have to have a certain critical mass of funding - a basis of financial support to survive [research funding] cycles,"" Ault said. ""We had that 20 years ago, and now we're doing very well.""MMCRI broke ground recently on a spacious new addition and is looking to bring in seven or eight more principal researchers with their own staffs. (One already on board is bone specialist Dr. Clifford Rosen, formerly of Bangor.) The new addition will be half the size as the original building but is expected to cost about the same amount. It will include a clinical area, where patients enrolled in medical trials can receive their treatments and be examined.In Brewer, plans for the new laboratory facility are taking shape, but more modestly than initially envisioned. Citing financial and logistical slowdowns, EMHS has committed to a scaled-back version that will give scientists some access to patients but keep the majority of research housed at Jackson Lab, the University of Maine and elsewhere.Construction will begin next spring on a new cancer care center next to the EMHS headquarters in Brewer. That building also will include offices, meeting rooms and other first-phase components of the Maine Institute for Human Genetics and Health.Online: ww.mainegenetics.org and www.mmcri.org/.",0,,,

The chairman of the Metro Association of Classroom Educators told Maureen Downey that the kids are the problem in schools today?If it weren't for those ""unmotivated and lazy"" students, our schools would be just fine?Is he kidding?He sounds like all of those Republicans who run for office saying that government is the problem, not the solution. If they think that, shouldn't they stay as far away from government work as possible?Oh, and ""sleep deprived and hungry"" can look an awful lot like ""unmotivated and lazy.""But surely the chairman of the Metro Association of Classroom Educators knows that. Oh wait, apparently not. And don't get me started about blaming the victim. God forbid any female in this guy's life be sexually assaulted.I'm guessing his response would be that the main problem was the fact that she has those damned lady parts.Sally Sams, MariettaEducators blast test they can't get kids to passThe column by Rick Breault on the SAT is another example of ""kill the messenger.""The standard solution for Georgia educators, when they don't get test results to their liking, is simple --- do away with the test. The value of the SAT as a measurement of educational progress is its consistency.So, how are we doing? Don't ask. SAT scores have been dropping nationwide for decades and they are (if measured against the old scoring methods) at their nadir.Educators hated this so much, they coerced the creators of the test to change the scoring several years ago by adding a third element, ""writing"" --- which could not be scored empirically and which was given the same weight as the verbal and math portions.By changing the test, educators thought they might make it more difficult to judge apples to apples, but that ruse sadly failed.A test of one's knowledge and critical thinking abilities, the SAT was designed to give educators an idea of a high school senior's likely ability to succeed in college.When it was first given, a student took it once, in his or her senior year of high school. There was no PSAT, no SAT prep classes, no multiple chances as there are today. Yet, even with all these crutches, the scores keep falling.What's a professional teacher of teachers like Mr. Breault to do? Get rid of the test.We are in a crisis and it's deepening. Quit calling failure by other names.Quit inflating grades and lowering standards. Quit trying to kill the messenger who brings you the bad news. Grow up and accept responsibility. It's yours.Bill McNew, FayettevilleSAT is not a good measure of potentialAs a retired home schooling mom, I agree with Rick Breault. I do not believe the SAT is an indicator of a student's potential.As our sons' primary educators, my husband and I did not ""teach"" to the test, any test. Our sons, now both in college, are three years apart in age.They were reared in the same home by the same parents who used the same parenting philosophy and disciplinarian techniques with both of them.Further, they were taught the exact same subjects with the exact same curriculum by the exact same teachers. With all of this ""sameness"" one might conclude both students performed approximately the same on standardized tests.Quite the opposite is true. Our older son tested in the 97th percentile on the third-grade Iowa Tests of Basic Skills and performed at the same level on all subsequent rounds of the test.His younger brother, however, always scored average and suffered from test-taking anxiety.Today, our oldest son is 23 and has been married for two years.He and his wife have three dogs, a cat, a new house complete with mortgage, and he attends classes at night while working in his career field full time. College has been relatively easy for him.Meanwhile, our younger son is almost 21 and attending college full time and working part time.He is excelling in college while enjoying a busy social life and sharing his passion of singing and writing music.The same, yet different. Both young men will earn degrees in business but will most likely apply their educational experiences differently.Both will be successful.The ultimate goal of all levels of education should be self-sufficiency and literacy.In the present economic climate, Americans realize success is not about how many degrees one has or how many dollars one makes.Vicki Davis, AtlantaDirect more lottery dollars to HOPEIn ""Lottery funds can't keep up with HOPE,"" Metro, Aug. 31, we are informed that the amount of lottery money going to education programs grew by less than 1 percent during the past year.Comparing fiscal year 2009 lottery sales --- reported in the AJC, July 18 --- with lottery sales in fiscal year 2008 --- reported in the state audit --- lottery revenue grew by 12 percent.Why the enormous difference between lottery revenue growth and the growth in lottery money going to education?The legislation creating the Georgia lottery stipulated that ""as nearly as practical"" for each fiscal year, net proceeds for the state's ""Lottery for Education Account"" shall equal 35 percent of the lottery proceeds.However, since FY2001, net proceeds as a percentage of lottery proceeds have declined yearly from 32.9 percent in FY2001 down to only 26.4 percent in FY2008, according to the Georgia Department of Audits and Accounts special report issued in February.Before the legislative leadership in this state considers any further cuts to the HOPE program, it should examine the management of the Georgia Lottery Corp. itself.Chris Valley, AtlantaEmphasize the arts in teacher educationThe arts have not been given a proper place in teacher-education training.If teachers were trained to discover their creative abilities while training to be teachers in college and graduate school, our classroom would be alive with active, responsive students who know how to think, plan, and create themselves.Instead of administrators insisting that there is no time --- or money --- for the arts, they would already be in place from science to math to language arts classrooms.The obligatory high school musical certainly has its place, but this is not an arts program that benefits and serves the educational needs of all students.The arts-in-education approach develops a visual literacy that encourages students to love reading and writing. I can do this!And so can many others.Gale Sheaffer, vice president of advocacy, the Association of Theatre in Higher EducationPresident Obama deserves our respectPresident Barack Obama is being crucified for needing more than eight months to straighten out a mess that was eight years in the making.Now his critics do not want to allow him the privilege of speaking to schoolchildren, as has been done by other presidents.Politics? Racism? Sore losers? All of the above?Either way, if children are being taught to disrespect the highest office in the land, what or who will they respect?Shame on educators and parents or guardians who allow this to happen.JUDY HARRIS, ATLANTA",0,,,
137,7WB7-P991-2R2Y-734W-00000-00.txt,"c(""Aug. 7--As the ***recession** cemented its grip on the region last year, Sacramento area incomes took a worse pounding than those of average Americans, according to federal statistics released Thursday.The data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis provided fresh evidence that the Sacramento area, one of the epicenters of the real estate meltdown, has been among the hardest-hit regions in the country. Incomes here failed to keep pace with inflation in 2008.The BEA statistics don't take into account the layoffs that have hammered the region this year -- and that are likely to continue for at least several more months.Nor do they factor in the effect of state furloughs, which began in February and will reduce the typical state employee's pay by 14 percent through next June. State government is the region's single largest employer and accounts for nearly 10 percent of its jobs.Per-capita personal income in the four-county Sacramento region grew just 1.5 percent last year, to $39,002, according to a BEA analysis of incomes in all U.S. metropolitan regions. That was below the U.S. average of 2.5 percent.It was also below the 2.4 percent inflation rate, which was mostly the result of high gas prices, the BEA said. That means regional incomes went backward in 2008.Diana Diamond of Roseville said her family was affected in the past year by a number of economic issues, including furloughs imposed on her husband, a state Department of Transportation employee.\""It's kind of sad to be going back in time,\"" she said. \""Inflation's not going back in time.\""Unemployment in the Sacramento area and statewide has hit 11.6 percent. National unemployment is 9.5 percent, with new numbers due to be released today.The BEA statistics illustrate the not-so-gradual slowdown in the Sacramento region's economy. Per-capita incomes rose 3 percent to 5 percent a year during the housing boom before limping along at just 1.5 percent last year. Among the 373 metro areas in the country, Sacramento ranked No. 310 in income growth.\""We are probably taking a bigger economic hit,\"" said Sanjay Varshney, dean of the College of Business Administration at California State University, Sacramento.Among California metro areas, San Jose incomes slumped the worst last year. Per capita incomes fell 0.9 percent before accounting for inflation, a reflection of the downturn in the local tech economy.The BEA numbers show the extent to which Sacramento area incomes were propped up last year by government payouts, including unemployment benefits and a cost-of-living increase in Social Security, said BEA economist David Lenze. Those payments jumped by almost 9 percent last year, pouring an additional $1 billion into the region's economy.Without the increase in government payouts, per capita incomes in the Sacramento area would have been essentially flat -- even before accounting for the negative impact of inflation.Lenze said the income statistics, because they cover the entire year, don't reflect the acceleration in the downturn beginning last September. The ***recession** officially began in December 2007, according to the private National Bureau of Economic Research, but didn't really take hold until last fall.\""The calamity was in the last quarter of the year,\"" he said. \""The economy dipped slowly at first and then dropped off after the stock market crashed.\""Despite signs of stability in the national economy, California's immediate future continues to look bleak. Chapman University's quarterly California Employment Indicator Index, released Thursday, predicted more layoffs ahead.The Orange County university's third-quarter index came in at 72.1, slightly worse than the second-quarter reading of 73.4. Anytime the index comes in below 100, that means the forecast is for more job losses. Chapman said it believes job growth won't occur until early next year.That's in line with other predictions. A recent forecast by Sacramento State said unemployment in the region could rise to 13.5 percent next year.Call The Bee's Dale Kasler, (916) 321-1066.

Domowicz wouldn't put his book down, even to get his coat on as the class was getting ready to leave the library. While looking through some other books, McClain may have summed up why.\""We like reading,\"" he said.Teacher Elizabeth Eggert said the class visits the library every two weeks. That's when the weather is good; if it isn't, then the library comes to them. The kindergartners seemed to like being in the library on Friday.\""They love it,\"" Eggert said.Upstairs on the second floor, Kendell Bell was browsing through the library's CD collection. He said he comes to the library looking through the collection of CDs and movies for something he likes. Borrowing them from the library is a lot cheaper than buying them in a store.\""I'm here every day,\"" Bell said. \""It's open to everybody.\""As the economy is mired in ***recession**, local libraries are seeing an increase in people using library resources. That includes doing everything from taking out a book, to computer usage, to borrowing CDs and movies. Lockport Public Library Director Marie Bindeman said there's been more circulation of materials than last year.\""We've noticed more traffic, more Internet usage,\"" she said.\""There's been an increase in activity with interlibrary loan.\""An interlibrary loan occurs when a library in the Nioga system needs a resource and requests it from another library in the system. It covers libraries in three counties, Niagara, Orleans and Genesee.Kristine DeGlopper, Newfane Free Library director, said she's noticed an upturn in activity too.\""We've seen a lot more users, and circulation is up,\"" DeGlopper said.She added that Newfane relies on Interlibrary loans, as it helps people find something they're looking for, even if it isn't at her library. DeGlopper said more people have been using computers and looking for Internet connection as well.Both the Lockport and Newfane libraries offer other resources besides books. Adults and children, alike, can find DVDs or videos, audio books, puzzles and some games. A game table is set up at the Lockport Library, offering players a choice of what to play.\""There's chess, backgammon, checkers,\"" Bindeman said.Among some new offerings, Bindeman said the library has added \""Playaways,\"" a digital audio book for children. The books are self contained with ear phones, meaning kids don't need a player. There's also a winter time reading program for adults called \""Pop Open a Good Book.\""Libraries are also offering help in economic difficulty. Bindeman said libraries have a career resource section that deals with interviewing and resume writing. People can find information on different career opportunities and how to pursue them.Also, the Nioga library system is in the process of upgrading to a computer automation system and catalog. Online, the library's Web site will look different, but the change will help the public.\""It'll enable folks to get information faster,\"" Bindeman said.DeGlopper said the economy certainly is playing a role in the increase in activities libraries are seeing. People just don't have extra money to spend.\""People who are hit hard cut back,\"" she said. \""Movies, buying books are among the first things to get cut.

139,4RPV-TSH0-TWCM-K1JY-00000-00.txt,"Yahoo! co-founder and CEO Jerry Yang's uphill scramble to transform the Internet giant and keep pace with rival Googlecontinued to face what he called ""headwinds,"" as the company again reported disappointing earnings and confirmed plans to slash around 1,000 jobs next month.  The languishing Web titan reported yesterday that fourth-quarter profit fell 23 percent to $206 million, or 15 cents per diluted share, down from $269 million, or 19 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue increased 8 percent to $1.8 billion.  To convince investors that the company remains committed to fixing things, Yang and President Susan Decker told analysts that Yahoo! is narrowing its focus to a handful of key areas - the home page, search, its popular e-mail program, mobile services and personalized pages like its MyYahoo.  ""We are not tinkering around the edges - we are making significant and game changing investments in Yahoo!'s future,"" Yang said.       However, impatient investors focused on a 2008 sales forecast that came in below analysts expectations.   The company is calling for full-year revenue of between $5.3 billion and $5.9 billion after commissions.  Wall Street was hoping for at least $5.9 billion, according to published reports.  Yahoo! shares were off $2.16, more than 10 percent, to $18.65 last night in after-hours trading - a new 52-week low. The stock closed up 3 cents at $20.81, ahead of yesterday's earnings announcement, which came after the market closed.  Adding to investor anxiety were growing concerns that a slowdown in the economy will drag down Internet advertising. The company said it saw weakness in sectors like retail, travel and real estate.

140,4PXP-95Y0-TX31-W0B9-00000-00.txt,"In case you hadn't noticed, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson have been taking the housing mess a lot more seriously. Both noted in speeches this week that it will continue to weigh on the economy. Paulson has been pushing a privately financed $100 billion fund to help relieve banks of some of the dubious mortgage debt they hold.  And Bernanke has slashed interest rates and made funds available to encourage lending.This raises an obvious question: If they are so keen on the issue now, where were they -- and where were their predecessors -- when the subprime crisis was developing?The obvious answer is, nowhere to be found. Bernanke's predecessor, Alan Greenspan, was singing the praises of non-traditional mortgages as late as 2004. Not until the spring of 2005, when surging home prices and crazy lending practices were obvious to anyone, did he speak of a ""froth"" in the housing market and unsustainable housing credit market behavior.Until the middle of last year, Paulson was CEO of Goldman Sachs, a firm that helped peddle some of the most radioactive mortgage-backed investment products.  His predecessors at Treasury were, at best, blissfully ignorant to the building problem, and at worst a contributing factor. Over the past several years, they waged a bitter turf war with state legislatures and banking regulators -- arguably the only voices of caution during the mortgage bubble -- by repeatedly pre-empting their efforts to rein in some of the most unscrupulous lending practices.In short, they blew it. Now, people who took on risky mortgages are losing their homes, and, more to the point, Paulson and Bernanke are scrambling to keep the whole sorry mess from affecting everyone else.The tougher question is how far they should go.What is apparent from the fiasco is that supposedly smart investors can act in reckless and lemming-like ways. If they run off a cliff, they have only themselves to blame. But when they do so en masse, they can do great harm. As they try to sell their failing investments, markets can seize, banks can be destabilized and the economy can sink. Innocent bystanders get buried.That threat is prompting some bone-headed responses, such as calls for taxpayer-funded bailout programs, cumbersome regulations and a plague of lawsuits.There are better options. At the very least, government can demand more transparency. Incredibly, even as the housing threat was making front-page news, the companies that rate debt instruments so investors can make informed decisions were declaring extremely high-risk mortgage securities to be safe. Regulators might have slowed the stampede simply by pointing that out.In fact,  the art of ""jawboning"" more generally gets a bad rap, in part because Greenspan mentioned ""irrational exuberance""  in the stock market nearly four years before the tech bubble finally burst. But when financial institutions are snapping up high risk mortgages, government can do more to point out the folly of their ways.The subprime mortgage meltdown also cries out for more consumer protection and disclosure laws. If major institutional investors can't gauge the risks in today's complex mortgage markets, homebuyers certainly can't be expected to. But now, with what is normally the largest investment of their lives, they are pitched an array of exotic mortgage products that convey many of the same risks.Similarly, people are unlikely to know that their supposedly ultrasafe money market funds are investing in junk securities. That, too, calls for restrictions.Paulson's and Bernanke's remedies may or may not succeed. Taxpayers may or may not end up with a bill, as happened during the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s. But the housing mess should at least prompt changes that deter the next stampede.Bubble, what bubble?2004""American consumers might benefit if lenders provided greater mortgage product alternatives to the traditional fixed-rate mortgage.""-- then Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,Feb. 232005""The United States has the broadest, deepest, most successful housing markets in the world, supported by an interdependent financial services infrastructure.""-- then Treasury Secretary John Snow, April 72006""I strongly believe that the market's success in making these non-traditional products available is a positive development, not cause for alarm.""-- Robert Broeksmit, Mortgage Bankers Association,Sept. 202007""Some of the credit issues are there, but they're largely contained.""-- Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, March 6""The ongoing housing correction is not ending as quickly as it might have appeared late last year.

141,7WMG-RP90-Y8T5-Y201-00000-00.txt,"Canadians love Americanhealth-care debates because it means you notice us. Much like Tennessee or North Dakota, we like just being mentioned. But your debates allow us to replay our own debates about health care and their relationship to national myths.Consider a lunchtime conversation I had a few years ago with some American political scientists. Academics incapable of small talk, we began discussing why our similar countries had different health-care systems. I talked about political culture and national identity, which mystified the Americans a bit. They were interested in iron triangles; veto points; and the power of congressional committees, lobbyists and campaign donations. Those are important, yes, but I argued that health care was ultimately determined more by national identity and myths.Ask a Canadian about differences between our country and the States, and you'll get a threefold answer: One, gun control. Enough on that. Two, much better Super Bowl commercials that are blocked out by Canadian cable regulators. (This is actually discussed seriously. The fact that we watch the Super Bowl religiously is not discussed.) Three, we have health care for all and you don't.The reality of the two systems is of course much closer. But Canadians, who have a highly fragile and internationally ignored national identity, understand instinctively that health care says a lot about a country's heart and its understanding of itself.Facts are remarkably unimportant in health-care debates, as every incoming Democratic president quickly learns, especially if he tries to put his government hands on Medicare. The same goes for Canada. Just as a disturbing number of Americans seem to believe we have ""death panels"" here, most Canadians are convinced that American emergency room defibrillators are activated by credit card swipe. (""Your health card, not your credit card"" is a standard phrase in the Canadian political lexicon.) If it doesn't fit the national myth, it goes nowhere and is politically dangerous.This, of course, works both ways. While  Americans loudly proclaim their opposition to ""socialist"" health care, right-wing Canadian politicians are the quickest to pledge total opposition to privatization and ""two-tier health care.""Once facts are put aside, the national myths reinforce themselves, even across borders. Every Republican fulmination against Canadian health care gets big play in the Canadian media, because it reinforces our sense of difference with the States. (When Democrats criticize our system, we're hurt but keep quiet.)Perhaps you missed the ""Americans for Prosperity"" ads this summer featuring a Canadian woman's allegation that she would have died waiting for treatment in Canada. Canadians didn't -- the ads received national coverage and rebuttals and boosted our sense of difference with and superiority over the United States. ""An admitting nurse doesn't check your credit card -- she checks your pulse"" was the            sort of line typical from our unimaginative politicians.Now let's be clear -- you don't care about Canada (or North Dakota or Tennessee). But you do care about American health care and the outcome of the current process.A year ago, America had a great appetite for change, and a catalyst in candidate Barack Obama, that might have been able to shift the national myth enough to transform American health care, much like Lyndon Johnson established Medicare so firmly that it now needs protection from government hands. But having used up his superpowers on the global ***recession**, Obama is left to slug out the health-care debate with nothing but facts. He needs more than this to overcome a national myth that denies health care as a public good.Good luck and watch out for those death panels.The writer is a professor of political science at Carleton University in Ottawa.",0,,,

Even in the global ***recession** of the 1970s, Japanese exports never dropped that fast.  Most major European countries have not reported on January trade as yet, and the United States figures will not be out until March 13. But the rapid fall in trade has been experienced in virtually every country that has reported figures for January, as is shown in the accompanying graphs.  A year ago, businesses in many developing countries were confident that they could ride out an American ***recession**, if need be, without major problems. Not only were other industrialized countries still growing, but the volume of trade was growing between developing countries, and there seemed to be little reason  that would  suffer.  Nonetheless, that is happening, perhaps because much of that trade was in items destined to be sent on to industrialized markets after further work. China's overall exports were down 17 percent in January compared with a year ago, even though exports to Japan and the United States were off by 10 percent or less. Shipments to other Asian countries were off by much more, including a drop of 29 percent in exports to South Korea.  Chinese shipments to India were growing at an annual rate of more than 50 percent as recently as last summer. But in January, they declined by 18 percent.  The 17 percent drop for overall Chinese exports, while large, is still modest compared with the declines being felt by other developing economies. The three largest economies in South America -- Argentina, Brazil and Chile --  reported declines of 27 to 42 percent. Exports from Taiwan were off 46 percent, and those from Singapore fell by 41 percent.  The shrinkage of world trade may continue for some time, as ***recession**-induced falls in demand are intensified by protectionist policies aimed at shoring up local industries. Developing countries without large foreign currency reserves may also be hurt by a drying up of credit to finance investment and trade.  China is trying to offset the impact of the world ***recession** with a broad stimulus program aimed at increasing local demand for products. But that option is not available for many countries, which do not have large foreign currency reserves and will take in less in taxes as unemployment rises amid factory layoffs. ""

The vet bill was $70 for the antibiotics, exam, clipping, cleaning and stapling his wounds. In today's economy, such unexpected costs, well, bite. My predictable pet expenses alone are significant, including $210 for meds to prevent heart worm, fleas and ticks; $60 for rabies and other vaccines; and about $500 a year for dog food and biscuits. And that's not counting periodic grooming costs (he's been skunked once) and boarding, which can run $18 a day. According to the American Pet Products Manufacturing Association, caring for a dog or cat costs about $11,000 over their lifespan. Jennifer Miller of Oklahoma City has spent that and more on her four canines. She's paid $8,000 alone on her puppylike 14-year-old lab, who's survived two types of cancer and has a chronic neuromuscular disease. Of her three poodles, one takes monthly meds for seizures and another has colitis. \""It's been worth every penny,\"" she said. \""Our dogs are our family.\"" My daughter Jessica, 7, calls Eddie her brother.

144,4MVD-J9J0-TW87-N2KS-00000-00.txt,"Three prominent private-equity partnerships declined to bid on the troubled Tribune Co. media empire as the company closed its four-month auction yesterday, dealing a blow to some board members who had agitated for a sale as a way of raising the company's value. Bain Capital, a partnership between Thomas H. Lee Partners and Texas Pacific Group, and a consortium of Providence Equity Partners, Dearborn Partners and Apollo Management had kicked Tribune's tires in recent months. All dropped out in the end, sources confirmed, as concern continued about declining newspaper readership and advertising revenue.  It was unknown whether a pair of Los Angeles billionaires met yesterday's deadline to bid for the entire company. Philanthropist and former home builder Eli Broad and supermarket magnate Ronald Burkle had expressed interest in buying Tribune's largest paper, the Los Angeles Times, but for tax reasons, Tribune resisted selling the company piecemeal. Broad and Burkle would have bought the company, and probably sold its assets other than the Times.   Neither Broad nor Burkle commented yesterday, but conflicting reports swirled around them. On the one hand, there was no evidence that they ever sought financing for a bid, said an industry source who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the process is ongoing.  But another industry source said Broad and Burkle planned to bid for Tribune yesterday. That source also spoke on the condition of anonymity, for the same reason.  In addition to the Times, Tribune owns 15 newspapers, 26 television stations, one radio station, the Chicago Cubs baseball team, CareerBuilder.com and other Internet properties. The company is valued at about $7.2 billion. Tribune would not comment on the passing of yesterday's deadline. The board of directors has appointed a special committee to review bids and make a recommendation to directors, who set a deadline for action by the end of the first quarter, the company said.   If Tribune receives no bids, the company unexpectedly could regain some stability after months of turmoil.  Tribune essentially put itself up for sale in September, after a boardroom fight between the Chandler family and other directors. The Chandlers, longtime owners of the Los Angeles Times, came to Tribune in 2000 when Tribune bought the Times' parent company, Times Mirror.  Before the Chandler revolt, Tribune management had rolled out a plan to raise the company's stock price by buying back stock and selling non-core assets. The company is likely to return to that path, according to industry observers.  In early 2006, the Chandlers began expressing disappointment over Tribune's stock performance and agitated for a sale or breakup as a way of unlocking company value and possibly cashing out their stake. The Chandlers then forced the board to set a deadline for examining sale options. Tribune stock dropped below $28 a share last spring, then rose to $34 after the company agreed to explore a sale. The share price has since declined, and closed yesterday at $30.34, down 18 cents. After initial feelers, Tribune aroused little significant interest from potential bidders, who could not see paying the premium  --  as much as $40 a share  --  that the Chandlers had hoped for.   The Tribune buyback proposal guaranteed a price of $28 to $32 per share. Broad and Burkle considered making offers that matched that price, according to a source with knowledge of the process who requested anonymity.  One crucial turning point in the Tribune's auction was the surprise bargain-basement sale of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune in December, which scared many bidders away, according to one industry source. California newspaper chain McClatchy sold the Star-Tribune to private-equity firm Avista Capital for $530 million  --  less than half the $1.2 billion McClatchy paid for the newspaper in 1998. Before the sale, a member of one of the equity firms told the source that his firm would bid on Tribune. After the Minneapolis sale, the firm pulled out, the source said.  ""This is not a great time to be selling,"" said newspaper analyst John Morton. ""Particularly big-city newspapers.""  Newspaper growth in recent years has come from small papers, in areas underserved by national mass media. That worked against the Tribune, which pursued a strategy of having the biggest newspapers and television stations in the largest cities. Morton said the strategy was derailed by a combination of the 2001 advertising ***recession**, media-merger restrictions and the explosion of new information sources such as the Web.  ",0,,,

The key is in enhancing the borrower's ability to avoid default and make the monthly mortgage payment.The risk of default is always considered in the determination of asset value. Mr. Geithner's plan could be enhanced with the addition of a financial guidance program that will lower the risk of loss. The program should function similar to the safe-driving education courses that high school students take in order to lower their auto insurance premiums.Such a program would lower the rate of failure and thereby lower the loss potential. In fact, it could actually turn this crisis around by increasing the valuations of the troubled assets.We should acknowledge that the financial ignorance of borrowers contributed to this ***economic crisis**.Without an awareness of how to handle and manage money, we can expect a repeat. This lack of understanding of money is the elephant in the room.Borrowers are in desperate need of financial guidance in this complex economic environment. We must develop a program of immediate and specific financial guidance that will help borrowers make the monthly mortgage payments. What I'm proposing is not a so-called financial literacy initiative, which simply disseminates information and takes forever to complete, but rather a program that will help borrowers understand how to manage money in the shortest possible time and avoid the pitfalls that have previously caused financial distress.As the borrowers are successfully guided to avoid default, the financial and housing markets will respond favorably.

147,4RYD-H6D0-TW8F-G0Y3-00000-00.txt,"Wilbur L. Ross, the billionaire investor, said Friday that he would acquire a stake of up to  $1 billion in Assured Guaranty, choosing to invest in a  smaller but more stable bond insurance company over its larger but weakened rivals.  The investment by Mr. Ross and his private equity firm, W. L. Ross &amp; Company, comes as the bond insurance industry continues to grapple with fallout from the subprime ***mortgage crisis**.   Formerly purveyors of insurance for debt issued by local governments and authorities, the insurers have been hurt badly by guaranteeing complex mortgage-related instruments. As default rates have risen, these insurers have been exposed to billions of dollars in potential claims.   Mr. Ross said Friday that he chose Assured, the fifth-largest bond insurer, because it would require less ''damage control'' than peers like MBIA and Ambac Financial. Unlike those rival firms, Assured devoted less of its business to insuring structured mortgage instruments.  In the last year, Assured's shares have fallen nearly 18 percent. By comparison, shares in MBIA and Ambac have plunged at least four times as much.  Mr. Ross's choice of Assured, based in Bermuda, surprised many; speculation earlier this year pointed to Ambac as his likely target. He said Friday that he had not ruled out making arrangements with other insurers.  Under the terms of Friday's agreement, Mr. Ross will buy $250 million in newly issued common shares of Assured. He has also committed to buying up to $750 million in additional shares, so long as Assured retains its top-flight credit ratings, a crucial  requirement for its underwriting business.  Mr. Ross will also join Assured's board.  Shares in Assured closed Friday at $25.65, up 12.6 percent and giving it a market value of more than $2 billion. At current market prices, Mr. Ross's investment would give him control of about a third of the company.  The fresh financing will help Assured grow, especially in reinsurance. The company agreed in December to guarantee $29 billion in investments already insured by Ambac, freeing some capital for the larger insurer.  That is crucial to Ambac and other insurers facing potential downgradings from the credit ratings agencies. Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service refrained from cutting Ambac's and MBIA's triple-A credit ratings, but have warned they may do so if the two insurers do not raise enough capital soon.  Losing those top credit ratings would threaten the insurers' core business. MBIA said  in a regulatory filing this week that it had written ''very little'' new business since the marketwide credit troubles began, despite maintaining its triple-A rating.  MBIA has already raised $2.5 billion in fresh financing by selling  shares and debt to the public and to Warburg Pincus, another private equity firm. Ambac has been working with a consortium of eight banks, including Citigroup and UBS, to structure a bailout that would raise about $3 billion.  Both firms have also said they plan to cleave their businesses into separate municipal bond and structured finance insurance operations.  Mr. Ross is joining another prominent investor seeking opportunity in the bond insurance sector. In December, Warren E.

148,4THS-BMS0-TW8F-G03J-00000-00.txt,"TOKYO -- To some Western analysts, it is beginning to look a lot like 1989.In recent days, Japan's once formidable megabanks and financial titans are returning to the world financial stage after an absence of almost two decades, buying pieces of Wall Street institutions.But according to Japanese executives and bankers, who spoke frankly on condition that they not be named, the banks are acting not from a position of strength, but from a sense of desperation because of limited opportunities at home. Moreover, many analysts say that while Japanese companies may have cash on hand, the result of a happy set of circumstances, they still seem to lack the sophistication -- and the drive -- to supplant Wall Street as the world's pre-eminent bankers and deal makers.It is also unclear whether the Japanese are taking advantage of Wall Street's woes or the American firms are taking advantage of pliable partners. Bank analysts note that some deals involve Japanese companies putting up significant sums of money for minority stakes.What is clear is that in the last three days, Japanese firms have spent billions buying chunks of what were some venerable names in American finance.On Monday, the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan's largest bank, announced it was acquiring up to 20 percent of Morgan Stanley in a deal worth as much as $8.5 billion. On Tuesday, Nomura Holdings, the country's biggest investment bank, said it would spend an undisclosed amount to buy the Asian, European and Middle Eastern units of Lehman Brothers.In a statement on Monday, Nomura's chief executive, Kenichi Watanabe, called the Lehman deal a ''once in a generation opportunity.''Tokyo is abuzz with reports and speculation of more such deals. On Wednesday, several newspapers reported that another Japanese bank, the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, was in talks to invest as much as $2 billion in Goldman Sachs, joining the billionaire Warren E. Buffett, who on Tuesday announced a $5 billion investment in the Wall Street firm. A spokeswoman for Sumitomo Mitsui said the bank had made no decision yet.The Japanese have also surprised the world because it is they who have emerged as the buyers, rather than faster-growing Asian rivals like China and India. Banks in those countries often lack the expertise to expand overseas and have loan problems of their own.The willingness of the Japanese to step into the breach seemed to reinforce an image that the Japanese giant is back. But far from representing the rise of Japanese global ambition, the wave of acquisitions is the result of a timely convergence of opportunities abroad and a lack of opportunity at home.It is a convergence that began appearing more than a year ago, when corporate Japan began an unprecedented overseas buying spree long before it was clear that Wall Street would succumb to subprime wounds. And the spree extended far beyond banks, as the Japanese took advantage of depressed share prices to snap up American, European and Asian firms, in industries from banking and insurance to pharmaceuticals.According to market research company Thomson Reuters, Japanese companies spent $42.1 billion on overseas acquisitions in the first eight months of the year, up fourfold over the same period last year. That does not include the recent financial deals.''It seems like we've been seeing outbound deals everyday,'' said Yuichi Jimbo, head of investment banking at JPMorgan in Tokyo. ''We haven't seen this for 20 years.''Japan's banks find themselves in this position almost by accident. Having survived the subprime crisis relatively unscathed, they suddenly appear to be the last man standing in global finance. According to the International Monetary Fund, Japanese banks stand to lose about $8 billion in the $1 trillion subprime meltdown.But that is because Japanese banks were forced to sit out the mortgage-debt party on Wall Street. At the time, they were either busy cleaning up from the collapse of their own real estate bubble in the late 1980s, or too shell-shocked to venture into risky foreign investments.That has left them with healthy balance sheets and plenty of cash. They control most of Japan's $14 trillion in household savings, one of the world's largest pools of capital, exactly what crippled Western firms desperately need right now.While Japan Inc. may suddenly appear formidable again to outsiders, the view from within is quite different.Having been burned on such trophy acquisitions two decades ago as Rockefeller Center and Universal Studios, the last thing Japanese managers want to do is venture overseas again, they say.But with little hope of robust expansion at home, and a shrinking population that is rapidly aging, Japan's larger and healthier companies feel no choice but to go overseas in search of growth opportunities.They are also eager to build beachheads in the global economy ahead of their Chinese and Indian rivals.''Companies know the only way to grow is going overseas, and they have to get there ahead of the Chinese,'' said Peter Eadon-Clarke, a strategist in the Tokyo office of Macquarie Capital Securities.Banking analysts also say that while Japanese banks may have deep pockets, they still lack what it takes to truly compete in the world of global finance.Analysts point out that in some recent deals like Mitsubishi UFJ's investment in Morgan Stanley, the Japanese investor seems to be nothing more than a source of cash. Even in deals where the Japanese company takes control, they face the tricky task of integrating foreign employees and businesses into Japan's quirky, consensus-driven and often opaque corporate culture.This proved Japan's undoing in the 1980s, when cash-rich Japanese banks bought up Wall Street firms and even banks in California, only to see local talent jump ship when faced with corporate Japan's glass ceilings for foreigners and incentive systems that favored seniority. Many of the problems still exist, say analysts, a fact that reflects the broad cultural gaps that may hamstring efforts by Japan's commercial banks in particular to become global players.''There's no way they can become players,'' said Naoko Nemoto, a banking analyst at the Tokyo office of Standard &amp; Poor's. ''They are too bureaucratic, like the Finance Ministry. They don't have the greed or the drive.''Ms. Nemoto and other banking analysts said one surprising thing about the recent moves by Japanese companies was their speed, which they called highly unusual for cautious, lumbering giants like Mitsubishi UFJ, with $1.1 trillion in deposits. Analysts said this reflected the widely held feeling that, despite the risks of another foray abroad, the ***financial crisis** may be best chance Japanese banks have to re-establish a presence in overseas markets.''It's like skiing,'' said Ms. Nemoto. ''They will never be able to learn unless they get back on the mountain and try again.''",0,,,

151,4T3P-76F0-TWV2-50GH-00000-00.txt,"The federal government has finally taken serious and concrete action to help homeowners caught up in the wave of bad lending practices. The White House and Congress have come to terms on a sweeping, complex bill that will allow hundreds of thousands of homeowners to trade in bad mortgages for good ones, with no gimmicky balloon payments or other unaffordable demands.This is overdue.With Democrats united in favor of the measure, Ohio Republican Sen. George Voinovich joined a majority of Republicans in the Senate in support. On the House side, a supermajority of Republicans opposed the measure, including GOP leader John Boehner, R-West Chester. But Reps. Michael Turner, R-Centerville, and David Hobson, R-Springfield, joined the Democrats.More Republicans would have gone along if more of them represented places like Dayton and Springfield. The bill does include measures that must give taxpayers pause. Most specifically, it offers unlimited financial backing to the two huge, federally chartered mortgage businesses, known as Fannie Maeand Freddie Mac. In other words, the bill makes it official that, while these behemoths are free to make enormous amounts of money, once they start losing money, the government will step in to help. What a great business to be in!Something is wrong with that arrangement. And yet, Congress had a crisis of confidence to deal with, as a result of a sudden drop in Fannie's and Freddie's stock prices recently. The two behemoths are too big to be allowed to fail. To deal with the immediate problem now made sense, while putting off a serious debate about how the two should be structured.In the abstract, at least, an excellent case can be made that Fannie and Freddie should either be nationalized completely or privatized completely - not have the best of both worlds.Still, it must be said that no federal money will necessarily go to them as a result of this bill. The legislation says taxpayer money is there if they need it; Fannie and Freddie say it won't come to that. Making the money available is a confidence-builder aimed at the markets, which are looking for assurances.The bill also has a provision to help local governments buy foreclosed and abandoned property. President George W. Bush opposed this (as a bailout for lenders). For a while, there was talk of a veto. But his Treasury secretary convinced him that the other parts of the bill are too important to forfeit.The provision comes just as cities like Dayton and Cleveland are getting serious about reclaiming blocks and neighborhoods that have been devastated by the foreclosure epidemic.Coming up with the necessary money would be tough for cities.Overall, this sweeping bill suggests that times are changing. Aiding cities hasn't exactly been an obsession of the federal government recently. Now, at least some help is on the way.Meanwhile, the era of deregulation seems to be coming to an end. The housing ***mortgage crisis** itself is widely and reasonably seen by the political center as resulting from too little regulation. And every step taken to stem the crisis increases the role of government.In times like these, overreaction by government is always a possibility. But this bill is an obvious, constructive and moderate reaction.",1,,,
152,4RW9-HK70-TWKH-F0WN-00000-00.txt,"A coalition of U.S. mortgage banks said Tuesday that they would join a nationwide effort to stem a rising tide of home repossessions.Members of the Hope Now alliance said they would sign on to Project Lifeline, launched last week by six leading lenders. Under the initiative, seriously delinquent borrowers are offered a 30-day reprieve during which they can try to negotiate payment plans or new loan terms aimed at letting them keep their homes.'Just last week we saw six servicers take the lead and agree to this initiative,' said Henry Paulson, the treasury secretary.'Now that all Hope Now members have signed on, more than 90 percent of the subprime servicing market and nearly 70 percent of the entire mortgage servicing market is committed to this coordinated method of reaching more homeowners,' Paulson added.Tuesday's move came at the Bush administration's urging and amid a worsening economic outlook.Nearly 1.3 million homes fell into foreclosure last year, a 79 percent increase over 2006, according to RealtyTrac, a market monitor. The trouble appears to be spreading faster: In the final three months of 2007, foreclosures grew by more than 86 percent over the same period in 2006.Millions more risk being dispossessed this year as adjustable-rate mortgages reset at unaffordable levels, say economists.Project Lifeline is being made available to borrowers regardless of whether they have conventional or subprime loans. All previous relief efforts have been limited to borrowers with poor credit who took high-risk, high-cost loans that have been the focus of the mortgage mess.Some Hope Now members said they had taken measures similar to Project Lifeline before Tuesday's announcement. For most, however, the initiative marks new territory. When they came together late last year, they offered only to freeze interest rates on some subprime mortgages for up to five years. Typically, these loans feature interest rates that are set artificially low -- in order to entice loan applicants -- and that rise rapidly after one or more years.Some lawmakers have assailed the new initiative as insufficient.'This plan, while a step in the right direction, will not stem the tide of the millions of foreclosures we are facing in the coming months,' Chris Dodd, a Democrat and chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, said last week.Further action would be taken if needed to prevent foreclosures, Paulson said. Relief efforts so far have reached few at-risk borrowers, he acknowledged.Whole communities are wrecked as pauperised borrowers default on loans and lenders repossess their homes.Even a few foreclosures in a given neighbourhood can result in increased crime, the devaluation of surrounding properties, the erosion of the local tax base, and consequent revenue shortfalls. In turn, these factors force local authorities to cut public services.Municipal and state authorities, unhappy with the pace and scope of lenders' and the federal government's response, have taken financial firms to court.Some are suing lenders in hopes of recouping lost taxes and money spent on cleaning up foreclosed homes that, plaintiffs say, the mortgage companies should maintain.Other suits involve alleged predatory lending. The city of Baltimore, in the eastern state of Maryland, filed a federal lawsuit last month accusing a leading U.S. mortgage lender of steering black borrowers to subprime mortgages while granting safer traditional loans to similar applicants who were white. The firm, Wells Fargo &amp; Co., denies the charges.Maryland officials also have gathered evidence that lenders pushed disproportionate numbers of women into the substandard loans.As home prices fall and banks tighten lending standards, even borrowers with good credit histories are falling behind on loan and credit card payments. Politicians and commentators warn of an impending credit card crisis to dwarf the subprime mortgage fiasco.The White House expects the economy to grow by 2.7 percent this year. Private-sector economists anticipate growth of 1.6 percent. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its 2007 growth estimate to 1.5 percent and warns that the economy could grow by as little as 0.8 percent in 2008. This would fall behind population growth, estimated at 0.9 percent. President George W.

Lawmakers sought to fix the problem of taxes that had ballooned during a time of extraordinary increases in property values. But the fix is being imposed at a time when values are falling.The bottom line: In communities where overall property tax revenues go down, local tax rates may go up.\""Under this scenario, (local governments) are allowed to receive the same revenue they received in the past year,\"" said Tim Wilmath, director of appraisals for the Hillsborough County property appraiser. \""So someone could end up with a higher tax bill than they did the year before, even though values are going down.\""- - -At their special session in June, lawmakers decided to sever the link between rising property values and higher government spending.They capped the amount of property tax money city and county governments could raise. Basically, it would be anchored to the amount of revenue from the year before. The only increases would come from new construction and adjustments for inflation.No matter how high property values soared, property taxes would not automatically rise with them.The cap seemed to make good sense - as long as property values were going up.But what if values go down?Lower assessments should mean lower taxes. But remember, the budget is anchored to the previous year's revenue. Maintaining the same tax rate would mean lower revenue. So, local governments can raise tax rates to bring in as much revenue as the prior year.And there's more.Remember the part of the tax plan that allows governments to raise revenue to account for inflation?Once again, governments can impose this cost (roughly 4 percent a year) on taxpayers even at a time of declining house values.- - -While total assessed value of a county or city doesn't decline often, it has happened.In the early 1990s, the entire Tampa Bay area was gripped by a ***recession** in the commercial market and flat home sales. Overall values fell slightly in 1992 in the city of Tampa and in Pinellas County, and were nearly flat in Hillsborough County.(A footnote in a House analysis of the Legislature's tax plan addresses what would have happened if the tax cap had been in effect back then. \""During the weak real estate market of the 1990s, property taxes grew less than would have been allowed under the cap.\"")\""We do follow the market both ways,\"" said Pinellas County Chief Deputy Property Appraiser Pam Dubov. \""It just doesn't lead us to a decline very often.\""Elected officials will not have to raise tax rates to make up for declining assessments. But if they don't, they'll be locking themselves into lower revenues for years to come.\""They've got us painted into a corner,\"" says Pasco County Commission Chairwoman Anne Hildebrand. \""Is there any money to keep the lights on?\""Still, raising tax rates may be hard to explain to the taxpayers.\""If the millage goes up, to taxpayers, that's a tax increase,\"" said St. Petersburg City Council member Rene Flowers, who is president of the Florida League of Cities. \""So the issue for elected officials, particularly in an election year, is do I want to raise the millage?- - -Of course, elected officials will face the question only if overall assessments drop for the whole community, and not just for some individuals.Though the commercial market is holding strong, sale prices for homes in Pinellas so far this year are down 7 percent compared to last year, with condos down 8.3 percent. Hillsborough home sales prices are down about 2 percent. At least a half-dozen beach cities in Pinellas County have seen their overall property values decline, in part thanks to falling condo prices.For Tampa Bay as a whole, home sale prices in June compared with last summer were down 6 percent. Statewide they were down 5 percent.- - -This story may give some readers a sense of deja vu.The St. Petersburg Times reported earlier this month on a quirk in enforcement of the Save Our Homes amendment, which limits annual increases in taxable value to 3 percent on homesteaded properties.Voters, tired of rising assessments, approved the amendment to keep people from being taxed out of their homes.This year, however, more than 100,000 Tampa Bay area homeowners will see their assessed values go down.But the state interprets Save Our Homes to mean that taxable values can rise up to the \""cap\"" regardless, letting local governments \""recapture\"" some of the savings homesteaders have enjoyed.

156,4PWJ-GD80-TW8F-G0TP-00000-00.txt,"For Chile and Argentina, it was the frostiest of winters, and not just the reading on the thermometer.  During one of the coldest South American winters here in decades, neighboring Argentina cut at least  90 percent of the natural gas it sends to Chile 79 times along pipelines that connect the two countries.  Power plants and factories in this smoggy capital were forced to switch to diesel and fuel oil, which belch more air pollution and have nearly quadrupled the cost of producing electricity. Santiago reported its highest number of dangerous smog days in the past seven years. Argentina's actions have chilled relations between the two countries. But the impact of South America's energy crisis is far broader. Across the region, concerns about energy are roiling national politics, generating tensions between neighbors and emerging as one of the biggest brakes to growth and integration.   Energy is the Achilles' heel of the governments in Brazil, Argentina and Chile, which are struggling to maintain sufficient natural gas supplies after several years of strong economic growth.   ''Bottlenecks in energy supply will be a critical policy concern in Latin America over the next two to five years,'' said Christopher Garman, the Latin America director at Eurasia Group, a New York-based consulting firm.   Energy concerns are at the top of the agenda for the region's incumbent leaders, most of whom have high popularity ratings, thanks mostly to buoyant economies riding a wave of higher commodity prices.  But the steady economic growth has only increased energy demand, while governments have failed for a decade to invest enough in natural gas exploration and new power plants to expand their energy supplies.   President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil is particularly preoccupied with the risk of power shortages that could occur as early as 2009, according to analysts. In an interview in September, he said the region's gas woes were reason to support new hydroelectric power plants and projects to produce electricity from sugar cane. ''I do not want to make Brazil dependent on gas,'' he said.  The other alternative is to raise consumer prices or impose austerity measures, something politicians have been reluctant to do. History shows they can help sink a president.  When Brazil suffered an energy crunch in 2000, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso implored consumers to conserve, imposing penalties on those who did not. In the end, a major crisis was averted, but the government's approval rating dropped by a third, and Mr. da Silva -- not Mr. Cardoso's chosen successor -- was elected in 2002.Nestor Kirchner, Argentina's president, has steadfastly refused to raise his country's gas and electricity prices, which are among the lowest in the world, ahead of the Oct. 28 election. Mr. Kirchner's wife, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, is the leading candidate to succeed him.   Instead, his government placed winter energy-use restrictions on industries  and cut off its neighbor to the west, Chile.  Mr. Kirchner's strategy has satisfied voters and kept Argentina's economy humming, for now. But the low gas and power prices have scared away needed foreign investment in energy development and raised fears of runaway inflation.Argentina could be digging itself a bigger hole to crawl out of. While the government refuses to impose on residential consumers to cut back, Argentina's energy demands are rising faster than supply.   Power plants have little or no spare capacity and are suffering from a lack of maintenance, increasing the chances of brownouts or blackouts, said Sylvie D'Apote, an analyst with Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Argentina's energy troubles began with the crushing ***economic crisis** of 2001, when its currency, the peso, was devalued almost overnight by some 300 percent. In a panic, the government moved energy rates from dollars to pesos.   Suddenly Argentine natural gas was the cheapest in Latin America, and residential electricity rates were among the lowest in the world.   For Mrs. Kirchner, if she is elected, changing course would be risky. Raising energy prices would only worsen inflation and raise the ire of Argentine voters, potentially spoiling the Kirchners' plans to tag-team the presidency for the next 12 years. Argentina's economy, which is expected to grow this year by about 8 percent for a fifth straight year, is struggling with rising inflation pegged by private economists at nearly 20 percent, more than double official government claims.  Mr. Kirchner has denied there is even an energy crisis, noting that residential consumers have yet to feel a pinch.   Instead, it is Chile that is being squeezed. With few energy resources of its own, Chile had come to rely on Argentina for natural gas. The neighbors signed contracts in 1994, giving Chile a cheap source of fuel and a way to help clean Santiago's notoriously smoggy air.  Argentine officials say that the Argentine Congress never approved the energy accords, making them nonbinding. The Chileans call that claim ludicrous.  The energy crunch is already contributing to inflation in Chile. Chile's inflation is expected to be 6.4 percent this year, nearly a third of which is attributable to the cost of energy and food, said Pablo Goldberg, chief economist for Latin America at Merrill Lynch.   Political problems have limited Chile's energy options. Bolivia, which has the largest gas reserves in the region, has forbidden Argentina from re-exporting Bolivian gas to Chile because of a decades-old dispute over maritime access rights.   Analysts have doubts in any case about just how much natural gas Bolivia, which nationalized its gas sector last year, can extract without foreign investment.   With few options, Chile's government, led by President Michelle Bachelet, is moving on several fronts to diversify its energy supplies.   Two liquefied natural gas terminals should be completed by the middle of 2009. Chile is also opening up some land for oil and gas exploration, though it historically has found little.   Ms. Bachelet received a government-financed study last week exploring the prospects for building nuclear power plants, which is likely to be a controversial decision for the next government.  ''We can't just wait with our arms crossed and hope for a miracle to happen,'' said Antonio Baciagalupo, the chief executive of GNL Quintero, the consortium building the liquefied natural gas plant near Santiago.

Charlie Crist's statement:""I want the express my appreciation to the Governing Board for their courage in taking the historic step today to acquire land that is essential for the restoration and revival of the Everglades. I thank the members for their careful reflection and their eagerness to seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. By gaining access to hundreds of square miles of prime property, the River of Grass and the wildlife that depend on it face a brighter and more secure future.""Posted by Mary Ellen Klas at 04:54:34 PM on May 13, 2009***LeMieux explores 'allure' of a race for A.G.George LeMieux served as Florida's deputy attorney general for three years while his mentor, Charlie Crist, was A.G. Now LeMieux himself is considering running as a Republican candidate for that open Cabinet post in 2010.""I've had a lot of people approach me,"" LeMieux said Wednesday. ""There's no better client than representing the people of Florida, so it has a lot of allure for me."" LeMieux, who will turn 40 in the next couple of weeks, has three children 6 or younger, and is chairman of his law firm, Gunster, Yoakley and Stewart, so running for office would be a major change in his life.""It's a big decision,"" LeMieux said, ""but I know what it takes to run a campaign."" He said he would seek the advice of many in the days ahead -- including Crist -- and hoped to make a decision ""very quickly."" Surely his interest is motivated in part by a less-than-impressive field that may include first-term state Rep. Tom Grady of Naples and Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp. Others mentioned: U.S. Senate hopeful Marco Rubio and Rep. Ellyn Bogdanoff, who's also eyeing the Jeff Atwater state Senate seat.LeMieux ran for state House in Fort Lauderdale in 1998 and lost to Democratic Rep. Tracy Stafford.

In unique and challenging times like these, our state needs a new and different kind of leadership.Thousands of Floridians have told me they need leaders committed to protecting the middle class, strengthening our economy and giving our families a fighting chance. As a businesswoman and working mom, I couldn't agree more.Before the people of Florida elected me their CFO, I spent nearly three decades in business creating jobs and economic opportunity in communities all across our state. During my short time in state government, a couple of things have become crystal clear: Tallahassee's tired, old ways of doing business just aren't enough to answer the urgent, new challenges we face. And a state government influenced by narrow special interests cannot put the best interests of everyday Floridians first.Today, I'm announcing I will be a candidate for governor of Florida in the November 2010 election, and put my business experience and knowhow to work restoring our economy.And as Florida's CFO, I'll continue using my business experience to cut wasteful spending, crack down on financial fraud and reform state contracts.For too long, we've had to tolerate a state government that puts playing politics ahead of helping families.

Arnold Schwarzenegger announced Tuesday that the state landed $42.7 million in stimulus funds to help prevent homelessness -- $1.6 million of which will be spent right here in Humboldt County.\""It's a tough time, and this is aimed at helping people get through the immediate ***economic downturn**,\"" said Bill Rodstrom, a senior planner with the Redwood Community Action Agency, the local entity that received the $1.6 million award. \""We expect a lot of demand.\""The funds, which were dispersed through the California Department of Housing and Community Development, came as a part of the $800 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was passed by Congress in February. Part of that funding went to the federal Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program, which in turn divided it among state agencies, including California's housing department, which spread its $42.7 million allotment among 31 agencies and local governments -- including RCAA.The funds are designated to provide short- and medium-term rental assistance to individuals and families who are currently in housing but at risk of becoming homeless, and to individuals and families who are currently homeless.\""This funding will boost efforts helping those who find themselves on the edge of homelessness and add support for the homeless -- and it couldn't have come at a better time, thanks to President Obama's Recovery Act,\"" Schwarzenegger said in a press release. \""My administration is working around the clock with the federal government to pump recovery funding into California quickly, responsibly and, in this instance, to provide assistance to individuals and families in California facing homelessness.\""In Humboldt County, Rodstrom said the $1.6 million award will help fund the Homeless Prevention Partnership, which brings together a variety of local agencies in an effort to both prevent homelessness and help currently homeless people get back on their feet.Rodstrom said the partnership is still working out the specifics of who will qualify for assistance, but said the new program will offer a variety of services, including paying off up to six months of back rent for people who fell behind in payments because of the ***recession**, paying up to 18 months of rent for people who are in danger of being evicted or having their property foreclosed and helping the recently homeless to find new housing. To that end, the program will also provide security deposits, utility deposits, credit repair services, legal services, financial counseling and case management.Rodstrom said the case management aspect of the program is huge. With thousands of people in the county having lost their jobs, Rodstrom said the program will deal with lots of people who have never been down and out before.\""Because their incomes have never been this low, they might not realize there are other benefits to help get them through this tough time,\"" Rodstrom said, adding that case managers can help set up families with food stamp assistance, discount rates on utilities and other services.The program is able to offer assistance in so many areas, according to Rodstrom, because it brings together a wide range of agencies that all have their own niches of expertise. Agencies specializing in substance abuse, domestic violence, housing, credit counseling and more have all been involved, Rodstrom said.Karen \""Fox\"" Olson, the executive director of Arcata House, which runs transitional housing facilities in Arcata, said the program is a great example of community collaboration.\""We've been working as a continuum of care since 2004, so we really have continuing relationships and, I think, have built up a level of trust,\"" Olson said, who also serves as the co-chair of the Humboldt Housing and Homeless Coalition.So, Olson explained, when local service providers learned of the opportunity to apply for stimulus funds, they all banded together.\""Every service provider said, 'How we can we make this work and how can we get these funds for the community,'\"" she said. \""It was really great to work with everybody on the grant, and we all took different pieces and parts. RCAA has been very generous in figuring out how these funds could be shared among service providers.\""The collaborative effort, Olson said, will ensure that the funds help people throughout the county, from Arcata to Willow Creek, and provide help with the web of issues that contribute to homelessness, from financial planning to substance abuse.Rodstrom said the group placed a special emphasis on keeping administrative costs for the program down to ensure as much of the $1.6 million award as possible is spent on assistance. Over the life of the three-year award, Rodstrom estimated that less than $480,000, or 30 percent of the award, would be spent on administrative costs, with much of that going to the hiring of a program coordinator and a part-time fiscal director. He estimated the program will help more than 600 people.It will be a while before things get up and running, Rodstrom said, as RCAA still needs to sign a contract with the state, fill out a virtual mountain of paperwork associated with the stimulus funds and hire someone to coordinate the program.Careful to say he isn't familiar with this specific program or the award that's going to fund it, Humboldt State University Economics Department Chair Erick Eschker said a strong argument can be made for stimulating the economy with this type of government spending, or any type of government spending for that matter.\""In many ways it really doesn't matter (how the government is spending the funds),\"" Eschker said. \""When the government starts spending, it's income for someone.\""That means more people with more expendable income, Eschker said, adding that, from a stimulus perspective, this type of spending might be more effective than infrastructure spending, as the funds are more likely to have an immediate effect.\""You're injecting income into the economy,\"" Eschker said. \""In that sense, it could be a stimulus that takes place quickly.\""Thadeus Greenson can be reached at 441-0509 or tgreenson@times-standard.comTo see more of the Times-Standard, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.times-standard.com.

Utah's economy has lost 24,600 jobs in the 12 months ending Dec. 31, although state economists consider that estimate by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to be overstated by as much as 10,000. ""I think it's too aggressive,"" Workforce Department economist Mark Knold said.""Does that mean Utah doesn't have job contraction? That's not what I'm saying. I just don't think our contraction is that deep.""Job losses continued to be centered on construction, down 18.4 percent from December 2007. But Knold said all industries lost jobs last month, continuing a trend that showed up in November.""That's when you saw it en masse. Manufacturing was having its troubles earlier than that. But after the stock market crash you saw it just immediately in multiple other industries,"" Knold said.More than 18,000 construction jobs have evaporated since December 2007. Employment fell 18.4 percent during the period.""We closed 718 homes in 2008, and that was down from 1,128 in 2007. ... We've made layoffs proportional to our decrease in volume,"" said Clark Ivory, chief executive officer of Salt Lake City-based Ivory Homes.Real estate, closely allied to the fortunes of new-home construction, was hit hard in December, with jobs falling 4.9 percent from the same month of 2007.Last month, membership in the Salt Lake Board of Realtors was down almost 19 percent from the beginning of the year, falling to fewer than 6,500 realtors and brokers from 8,000 in January 2008.""It's a hard time, and really, there are probably too many agents to handle the number of sales,"" said Ryan Kirkham, president of the Realtor board and principal of Kirkham and Friends Real Estate in Salt Lake City.Kirkham said his agency had 45 agents a few months ago. The number is down to 40. He expects more agents to quit.""We will be down 10 percent to 20 percent by the time it's done,"" he said.Knold said unemployment probably will average 5.5 percent this year and jobs will continue to disappear, putting Utah on a negative growth track for the first time in seven years.""This year will be a year in which we will have fewer jobs in 2009 than we did 2008,"" he said.""That will be the second time in this decade that it will happen, but only the fourth time it has happened in the last 60 years.""The last time Utah jobs fell below the previous year was in 2002.Underscoring his prediction are initial claims for unemployment benefits. There were 4,200 first-time claims for unemployment benefits during the third week of December.

Even stalwart J.P. Morgan Chaseposted what it called ``very disappointing'' fourth-quarter results--including a $2.4 billion loss in its investment bank division, and profits that were 76% below year-earlier levels.``It's the kind of news that underscores why we said before that `chances are things could get even worse,' '' says Doug Turetsky, chief of staff of the Independent Budget Office, which just two weeks ago predicted that the city would lose 243,000 jobs through 2010. ``This makes things a little bit worse than where we were with that forecast.''And while Wall Street accounts for just 5% of the city's employment, it contributes about 23% of revenues. Declines in business will severely pressure city and state budgets this year and beyond.The factors behind the woes at the three financial giants vary. BofA's struggles stem largely from the $15 billion in losses it inherited from Merrill Lynch, which the bank officially acquired earlier this month. The setbacks at Citiand J.P. Morgan Chasearose from a gamut of problems, ranging from sour mortgages and home-equity loans to big losses in their credit card and investment banking arms.The hat trick of bad news shifted the outlook for the city's most important sector from dismal to horrendous, and left experts struggling to figure out just where the bottom for the industry and the city might be.``It's clear that not only are we not out of the woods, but that things are getting worse,'' says Michael Holland, chairman of private investment firm Holland &amp; Co. and a longtime observer of Wall Street. ``The fact that BofA, which looked so strong a year ago, now has to go to D.C. for help tells you how bad it is.''In its January Fiscal Outlook report, the IBO forecast that the city would lose 48,900 securities jobs, or 26.1% of the total, by the end of 2010. The last time New York lost that big a chunk of its Wall Street jobs was in 1973 and 1974, when 26.3% of those jobs disappeared in the teeth of the deepest ***recession** since the 1930s. Over that two-year span, the Dow slid 45%, and it took five years for securities industry employment to recover.``This is worse, because it is broader-based,'' says Mr. Holland. ``In the '70s, several brokerage firms went out of business, but nothing like what we've seen lately.''Additional cuts could come as a result of consolidation when Citispins off pieces of its business, and all three banks could be forced to contract.``The Citibreakup could result in more job losses than had previously been thought,'' says Ray Soifer, a consultant and former securities industry analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. ``Plus, all of these big banks will continue to feel pressure to downsize internally to save money.''Job losses aren't the only worry. Even before these latest blasts of bad news, the IBO was forecasting that profits in the securities industry would nose-dive to $7 billion this year, rising only modestly to about $10 billion per year in 2010 through 2012. That figure is less than half the $21 billion in profits that the industry posted in 2006.The dwindling earnings are wreaking havoc with city and state revenue forecasts. Already, state business-tax receipts were down 4.8%, or $269 million, for the first three quarters of the state's fiscal year, ended Dec. 31. The IBO projects that the city's 2009 business-tax revenues will plunge by a record 23.7%.How bad will things get? Don't ask (or read further).``I think '09 is going to be one of the worst years the city has seen in many decades,'' says Marisa DiNatale, senior economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. ``It could be the worst ever.''"",

Martin O'Malley's desk this week.The House and Senate are each adjusting new requirements related to the net worth that mortgage lenders and brokers must have to meet tougher state licensing guidelines, which are proposed in a foreclosure package that was a key part of O'Malley's legislative agenda.Both houses have passed the four mortgage reform bills by broad margins, some unanimously. The packages are largely similar and differences are being resolved.The bills would lengthen the foreclosure process to 45 days from the first foreclosure filing or 90 days from a default, whichever is longer. They also add a requirement that banks try twice to notify homeowners personally when they are in foreclosure, create a more specific law to prosecute mortgage fraud, and increase the state's ability to track people who originate mortgage loans. One bill in the package increases requirements for mortgage borrowers to show they can pay back a loan.Maya Brennan, research associate with the national Center for Housing Policy, called the legislation ""a major step in the right direction, in terms of reducing foreclosure risk, but not sufficient given the current problem. """"There's a bit of a gap,"" she said. ""It looks like there's not enough being done to work with some of the hardest-hit families struggling with the immediate effects. ""Anne Balcer Norton, director of foreclosure prevention at St. Ambrose Housing Aid Center in Baltimore, said some of the regulatory reforms help bridge the divide between the current crisis and the longer-term fix. She said if the legislation had been in place several years ago, St. Ambrose might have 60 to 70 percent fewer clients than it does now.Kathleen Murphy, president and CEO of the Maryland Bankers Association, also said it was best to look at the legislative package as part of a wider effort.Many in the General Assembly say the bills will be effective in girding the market against another collapse like the one that has rocked housing and financial markets around the country over the past year.Still, large changes in areas as important as homeownership can prove a tough sell to lawmakers. Many legislators and observers credit the O'Malley administration with working ahead on the packages through a task force formed last summer after the spike in foreclosures began.The Homeownership Preservation Task Force brought together bankers, brokers, regulators and housing advocates to hammer out a solution, and its findings formed the basis for the legislation proposed this year.""The fact is that if we sat down January 1 and tried to work all of these things out, it would be a very different environment,"" said Murphy, a member of the task force. She said the package works because its regulations, such as the lending restrictions, do not put Maryland out of line with federal guidelines that many bankers in the state follow.One notable change to O'Malley's proposal removed a provision that would have reduced the frequency of foreclosure notices in newspapers from three to one. The reduction was initially characterized as a cost-saving measure, but it was eliminated in the face of heavy opposition from the newspaper industry.Another change, which is still being worked out, would increase the ability of lenders and brokers to use a line of credit to fulfill new licensing requirements. Brokers and lenders have the same type of license to originate loans, and must show they have a certain amount of assets or cash before they can register.A likely resolution would allow originators to use credit as 75 percent of their asset backing, and would also push back the effective date until next year.Much of the legislative package is designed to look ahead rather than address the market's existing problems, but supporters point to O'Malley administration efforts that could have a more immediate effect. One emergency regulation calls for loan servicers, who process mortgage payments, to report on what they are doing to help customers who are behind on their payments.Meanwhile, another bill making its way through the House - not sponsored by the administration - would require prospective homebuyers to undergo counseling before applying for a subprime loan. That could come to the floor this week.Legislation targeting an immediate fix, such as a bailout plan for struggling borrowers, might not have had such an easy passage in the General Assembly. Senate Minority Leader David R. Brinkley, R-Carroll and Frederick, said he thought it was clear that something had to be done.He said he would not have supported a bailout plan, though.Del. Brian J. Feldman, D-Montgomery, a key House negotiator on the foreclosure package, said government must be careful not to go overboard in addressing a problem like this one.""We're never going to be able to foolproof the system, nor maybe should we,"" he said. Feldman said he believes the legislative package could become a model for other states.Thomas Shaner, executive director of the Maryland Association of Mortgage Brokers, said the package leaves intact the personal responsibility that borrowers must take for the decisions they made to take out bad loans.He said he watched through the process to ensure that the laws did not become too restrictive for mortgage brokers. Shaner said the association supports changes that prevent incompetent or disingenuous people from being brokers, but wants to be sure that legitimate borrowers can find a loan. That's why he has reservations about some aspects of the asset requirements and the counseling bill.""We're all concerned that some of these things, both federal and state, could lead to a decrease in the amount of mortgages in the market,"" Shaner said, ""and that doesn't help the economy.

163,4TR3-HD70-TW8F-G017-00000-00.txt,"Developing countries have sparked their share of international financial crises over the years. But this time it is not their fault.   As the world's richest nations spend trillions to rescue their own financial systems from the maelstrom caused by years of excess, they must also be prepared to provide billions to poorer countries that  did not cause this crisis but are nevertheless its victims.  The developing world has been caught up big time in the global credit squeeze, as beleaguered foreign banks have cut their credit lines and panicked foreign investors have pulled their money out. Private capital flows to emerging markets are expected to plummet 30 percent this year.   Exports are suffering as rich economies slow and commodity prices retreat. Remittances from migrant workers -- a core source of earnings for many developing countries -- are falling fast.   Eastern and Central Europe, where much of the banking system is controlled by Western banks, is in particularly dire straights. Ukraine asked the International Monetary Fund for $14 billion to prop up its financial system as money flees. Hungary got 5 billion euros from the European Central Bank. Pakistan -- America's hoped-for ally in the fight against Al Qaeda that also has nuclear weapons -- is said to need $3 billion to $4 billion to finance a gaping trade deficit.  Even robust economies with strong budgets and ample reserves have been walloped by the capital crunch. Two weeks ago,  the Mexican peso suffered its steepest drop since the peso crisis of December 1994. The Brazilian real and the Korean won have plunged by  a quarter   against the dollar.  Given the depth of the crisis here, it might be tempting to ignore the plight of developing economies. But it is in the clear economic interest of wealthy nations to help. The I.M.F. expects these countries to be the only engine of global growth in the next year or so.   Fortunately, some people are thinking ahead. The International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, is mulling a $3 billion fund to help recapitalize shaky banking systems in the world's poorest countries. The Inter-American Development Bank said it would increase its lending and announced a $6 billion facility to help companies in smaller Latin American countries that lose access to funding.The I.M.F. said it is flush with cash --$200 billion plus an additional  $50 billion in standing credit arrangements with donor countries -- to mobilize if needed. For that it will need the go-ahead from the United States and other big contributors. The I.M.F. must also be ready to relax -- within reason -- the battery of preconditions it usually attaches to its help.   The world's richest countries have exhibited enormous myopia throughout this crisis -- originally scurrying for ad hoc individual ''solutions'' that worsened the collective mess. Less than two weeks ago, Washington and Brussels allowed Iceland to go bust.  As the world's financial powers struggle to contain the disaster, they should not lose sight of its effect on other countries. Every economy for itself makes no sense -- and could prove highly dangerous -- in today's interconnected world. ",1,,,

The Dow ended the day down 40 points.The soaring deficits have raised worries about the willingness of foreigners to keep purchasing Treasury debt. The Chinese, now the largest foreign owners of U.S. Treasury securities, have expressed concerns about runaway deficits. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and other administration officials have sought to address those concerns by insisting that once the ***recession** is over and the financial system is stabilized, the administration will move forcefully to get the deficits under control.However, Republican critics contend the administration does not have a credible plan to address future deficits. Private economists worry the country could face the grim prospect of seeing interest rates soar in future years and the dollar weaken as foreigners dump their U.S. holdings.The Treasury Department said Friday that last month's deficit was $111.4 billion, below the $152 billion that economists expected but leading to a total $1.38 trillion shortfall with one month left in the budget year.Economists expect that some modest restocking triggered by the higher sales helped boost the economy out of ***recession** in the current quarter. Some analysts said the economy could rebound to growth approaching 4 percent, after it fell at a 1 percent rate in the April-June period.The Commerce Department reported Friday that wholesale inventories declined 1.4 percent in July, more than the 1 percent drop economists expected.More positive news came Friday when consumer confidence, as measured by the University of Michigan-Reuters survey, rose more than expected to a reading of 70.2 in early September, compared with 65.7 in August.The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits dropped last week to the lowest level since July.",1,,,

Just a few tweaks. ""The sound is upgraded, the seating is upgraded, the cabanas are upgraded,"" he said.Heck, even the cocktail waitresses are upgraded. ""My waitresses are hands-down the most beautiful waitress staff in the Hamptons,"" he boasted. ""I handpicked them myself! And they go through a rigorous routine to do so,"" he added, laughing. ""That's the cherry on top! They're fire.""Mr. Satsky, 31, can aggrandize with the best of them, his penchant for promotion proven by a plethora of Page Six mentions, dating back to his days at Stereo, the now-defunct West Chelsea spot he once dubbed the ""Yankee Stadium for DJs.""Popular with celebrities, as well as police, Stereo unceremoniously closed in January 2008, with Mr. Satsky and his former business partner at the club, Barry Mullineaux, each going their separate ways.Yet, its legacy lives on, if only in Mr. Satsky's vision for the future.""When I opened Stereo in 2005, it was such a different type of venue because our music program, the West Coast style of hip-hop mixed with rock 'n' roll, was not really something that was played in the clubs regularly,"" Mr. Satsky said.""The DJ AM–style of deejaying,"" he went on, referring to the renowned turntablist Adam Goldstein, ""was not considered normal for New York City. It was the Mark Ronson era. He was the greatest and the godfather. Mark Ronson would play a record and then he would go into another record and his timing and execution was impeccable. That was the standard in New York City. Then AM came in and did this whole mash-up, scratching situation, and at Stereo, that's what we showcased every second of every night. And then every other venue bit that formula. And now all the venues today still use that formula.""Mr. Satsky said he is aiming to set an entirely new standard, &amp;agrave; la Stereo, in September, when his newest Manhattan nightspot opens in the meatpacking district.""Breaking ground?"" asked Elon Kenchington, general manager at the Hotel Gansevoort, where Mr. Satsky was chatting with the Daily Transom one recent afternoon.For the record, Mr. Satsky declined to get into the specific location or concept, stating only in soaring terms, ""It's going to change the direction of nightlife in New York City and bring a real different flavor to the United States.""Another guy trying to change the direction of nightlife in the city is Mr. Satsky's former partner at Stereo, Mr. Mullineaux, who joined up with fellow impresario Jon Bakhshi, a.k.a.

""It's much different than Home or Guest House, contrary to what Mike said. We're one of the only clubs in the city open seven nights a week. We do a variety of everything. Monday nights, we do all rock 'n' roll, live music acts; Friday nights, we do European house music; Tuesdays and Thursdays, we have the hip-hop and rock 'n' roll mash-ups.

(The two haven't spoken in about a year, he said.)""He had no say in anything,"" Mr. Mullineaux said, noting that Mr. Satsky was originally brought in as promotional director at Stereo, having no real ownership or equity interest in the actual business. ""I had no choice but to side with the investors,"" Mr. Mullineaux said. ""I couldn't side with him and he took it personally.""Mr. Satsky pointed out that he did own trademark rights to the Stereo brand and added that he invested in the defunct club's initial renovation. He also took credit for establishing the venue's celebrity cred.

167,7VB0-F6C1-2PMW-Y11B-00000-00.txt,"It was British Prime Minister Winston Churchill who supposedly coined the term ""special relationship"" to describe the close cooperation between the United States and Great Britain.A bust of Churchill, which was given to George W. Bush in 2001 and sat in the Oval Office throughout his presidency, has recently been returned to the British Ambassador by President Barack Obama.It would be silly to read too much into a single event like this, but it is not an isolated incident. In their short time in the White House, the new president and his administration have been responsible for several apparent snubs of Great Britain.During British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's recent visit to the United States, he presented the president with a pen holder made from the wood of a British anti-slave ship. Brown in turn received a box set of 25 DVDs.The real kicker is the response given to a reporter from the U.K.'s Sunday Telegraph newspaper by a State Department official when asked about the Prime Minister's reception in Washington: ""There's nothing special about Britain. You're just the same as the other 190 countries in the world. You shouldn't expect special treatment.""If these statements and actions are indicative of the White House's attitude toward the U.K., the ""special relationship"" is in great peril.Not that a cooling of relations with the U.K. hasn't been noted before now. Britain's relationship with the last administration was complicated. President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair shared a great personal rapport, but many Britons were extremely critical of Blair's supposed subservience to Bush.Prior to his election, Obama made clear that repairing damaged relationships with American allies was a priority for his administration. In a speech last year, he singled out the ""special relationship"" as ripe for renewal: ""We have a chance to recalibrate the relationship and for the United Kingdom to work with America as a full partner.""But recent actions have suggested that, rather than try to undo the overbearing dominance of the ""special relationship"" by the U.S. during the Bush years, Obama has recalibrated relations with the U.K. by devaluing them entirely.It's hard to say whether these snubs of Britain have been the result of rookie mistakes by a new administration, the dominance of the domestic economy as the focus of the President's attention or a deliberate attempt to move away from a close relationship with Britain.Whatever the reason, a neglect of foreign policy and U.S. diplomacy with the U.K. cannot continue forever. If there is any intention of playing down the relationship with the U.K., the White House is making a grave mistake. The U.K. may not be the great power it once was, but it is still a valuable bridge between the U.S. and our more difficult European allies.Great Britain is also one of the few countries left in Europe willing to send its troops to fight alongside Americans.Perhaps most importantly, the president is undoubtedly going to attempt to organize international efforts to combat the ***recession**. In a globalized economy, Americans need to be concerned with what other countries are doing. The U.S. can't afford to snub a formerly staunch ally.(C) 2008 The Daily Gamecock via UWIRE",0,,,

Go, Sarah.Elizabeth PearsonElmhurstOdious optionsin budget crisisRegarding our new state budget cut, I would like to say that neither option of raising taxes or cutting state funded programs are right. Higher taxes mean we have to reach further in our pockets for pennies we don't have. But to cut state-funded programs would be a catastrophe.There are many at risk such as children, the elderly and disabled. These are people who need help. I do think that some programs are chivalrous. At the same, time there are many programs that are a necessity. For example, the elderly who get assistance for nursing homes, the disabled who need medication and cannot be financially solvent on their own and working parents or single parents who cannot afford day care and rent. These people will be left broke, homeless and hungry. Or, they will be on public aid sucking more money out of our government.My biggest frustrations come from choices our government is making, such as the choice to keep and not restructure financial aid. The recipients of medical, cash assistance, food stamps, and Section 8 are not giving back to society. If they are not working, the state will not receive any tax revenue from them.State-funded programs allow a wide variety of people to be employed. There are those who receive assistance from the programs, the organizations that the state-funded programs run through, employ thousands of people, and the services of which people receive the assistance for. That returns revenue to the state. If they end, the day care providers will struggle and cut jobs. Nursing homes will do the same. Parents will have the option to pay rent or day care, and will eventually lose their jobs and houses. These are only a few of the devastating consequences.Kara HealyLombardWhy health caregoing through roofOverhauling health care is a platform issue of any new president elect.

""I believe the government can take sensible, focused action to help responsible homeowners weather this rough patch.""Bush's remarks echoed a speech Friday, when he said the economy is going through a ""tough time"" and that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department will take ""appropriate steps"" to stabilize the financial system after a bailout of Bear Stearns Cos., the fifth-largest U.S. securities firm.Bush is scheduled to meet Monday with his Working Group on Financial Markets, the nation's top financial regulators that include Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Bush said Saturday he opposes a congressional plan that would give bankruptcy judges powers to reduce mortgage debts by decree, because banks would charge higher interest rates to cover the risk. Another proposal would have the government buy homes and take them off the market, leading to artificially higher prices than justified by the market, he said.""If we were to pursue some of the sweeping government solutions that we hear about in Washington, we would make a complicated problem even worse -- and end up hurting far more homeowners than we help,"" Bush said.Some congressional Democrats said Friday that the administration must do more to bolster the housing market, including backing a plan to let the Federal Housing Administration insure refinanced mortgages after lenders reduce principal to help struggling borrowers.""The president seems to be on a different economic planet than most Americans,"" Sen.

U.S. home foreclosure filings jumped 60 percent in February over the previous year, according to RealtyTrac Inc. of Irvine, Calif.Bush said the administration is pushing industry-led programs where lenders and service providers work with qualified borrowers to refinance home loans when they can't make their monthly mortgage payments. Government regulators also have stepped in to ensure that mortgage contracts are more transparent and fair, he said.The president said Congress must take other steps to ease the home-lending crisis, including revamping operations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the largest U.S. mortgage-finance providers.Lawmakers also must streamline the Federal Housing Administration to become more competitive in the mortgage market and permit state housing agencies to issue tax-free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages, Bush said.A $168 billion stimulus package of rebates to 130 million households beginning in May, and tax breaks for business available now, will help boost the economy, Bush and his economic advisers say.""By taking these steps and avoiding bad policy decisions, we will see our economy strengthen as the year progresses,"" Bush said in his radio address.",1,,,

This is our time, to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids, to restore prosperity ... to reclaim the American dream,  Obama said.For large pockets of America s population, prosperity is still an American dream deferred.Obama will confront the enormous challenge of leading the country out of what is surely a ***recession**. But the road out should be shared by all.Income for all U.S. households has stagnated. But the numbers are worse for Hispanics and African-Americans.  They are likely to suffer first and to suffer more in an economy that does not produce widely shared prosperity,  wrote Amanda Logan and Tim Westrich in an updated version of  The State of Minorities: How Are Minorities Faring in the Economy?  that was published by the Center for American Progress.And how are minorities faring?Not well.From income to unemployment to health care to homeownership, Hispanics and African-Americans lag significantly behind whites, according to the data compiled by the center.From 2000 to 2007, Hispanics  median family income declined from $39,935 to $38,679, an annualized average drop of 0.5 percent. Whites  median income also decreased during this time, but by only $12 (in 2007 dollars). Whites  median family income was $54,920 in 2007, 1.4 times higher than that of Hispanics.The median income of African-Americans declined by an average of 0.7 percent per year from 2000 to 2007, dropping from $35,720 in 2000 to $34,091 in 2007.In 2007, 8.2 percent of whites were in poverty, compared with 21.5 percent of Hispanics and 24.4 percent for African-Americans, according to the center s report.In the second quarter of 2008, the unemployment rate for Hispanics was 7.2 percent while the rate for whites was 4.7 percent. The unemployment rate for African-Americans, almost double that of whites, was 9.1 percent in the second quarter of 2008.In 2007, 32.1 percent of Hispanics and 19.2 percent of African-Americans didn t have health-care coverage, compared with 10.4 percent of whites.The homeownership rate for whites in 2007 was 75.2 percent, compared with 49.7 percent for Hispanics and 47.2 percent for African-Americans.Although the housing market collapse has rightly reminded people not to consider their house as a cash machine, a home still remains a significant contributor to the average family s net worth. Owning a home has historically been, and probably still will be, the path to prosperity.During the campaign, Obama was criticized as a modern-day Robin Hood who would rob the rich to give to the poor. My attitude is that if the economy s good for folks from the bottom up, it s gonna be good for everybody,  Obama explained in a now infamous encounter with an Ohio plumber, Joe Wurzelbacher.  I think when you spread the wealth around, it s good for everybody. That statement was interpreted to mean Obama wanted to redistribute wealth.But there s a difference between implementing tax policies and programs to make prosperity possible for everyone and pilfering the pockets of the top earners in the country.Besides, it s going to take more than tax breaks to lift many minorities to solid middle-class status. They need better schools, job opportunities and training. They need access to affordable health care so an illness doesn t bankrupt them. We need to find a way to provide reasonably priced homes and mortgages they can afford based on their net incomes.I know there are some triflin  folks, of all races, who don t want to work hard and are happy with handouts. But that description doesn t fit the vast majority of those at the bottom. They want their own slice of the pie, earned by expanding the pie with their own hard work, not by slicing away someone else s wealth. Let us remember that, if this ***financial crisis** taught us anything, it s that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers,  Obama said on Election Night.Economically speaking, many minorities are not living on Main Street, but their prosperity is just as vital to ending this country s ***financial crisis**.With Obama s victory comes a chance to make change,  and that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were,  the president-elect said.As Sam Cooke soulfully sang so long ago for too many people,  it s been too hard living. I believe that with President Obama, a man of color who has inspired so much hope, a change is gonna come.Michelle Singletary is a personal finance columnist for The Washington Post, 1150 15th St., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20071 and may be e-mailed at singletary@washpost.com",1,,,

We are working overtime making sure we make the best decisions possible.I am convinced this process will help shine a light on some of the more \""subtle\"" parts of the budget and will result in the finding and improving of operating efficiencies.We CAN reduce government waste! There are just too many programs that never seem to go away...regardless of their success or failure.Now is the time to streamline the system so we can focus on what's important.I am particularly gratified to be receiving a lot of input from constituents. I read and appreciate every e-mail and letter I receive.The direct link between the statehouse and the people we serve is more important now than ever.We need to understand what concerns and comments our friends and neighbors have. As always, I encourage you to contact me.There is much attention regarding the steps Congress is taking in Washington, D.C.The media here in Idaho is getting excited about the federal stimulus money that is supposedly coming our way.I want every reader know that the legislature has been given no news or promises about what, if anything, we might possibly receive.It is important to know that any possible federal stimulus money could have \""strings attached\"" that restrict states from control in how it is handled.For example, the federal government may dictate that states spend the money on programs we otherwise would not implement, then insist those programs continue once the stimulus money is gone.We can't expect Washington to know what our needs are in Idaho; besides, I believe many of the problems we are having now came from Washington in the first place.Economic downturns DO present some opportunities... and I am happy Governor Otter has invited me to join his \""Project 60\"" coalition, an initiative to grow Idaho's economy to $60 billion per year. We are focusing on creating new jobs and helping good companies expand their efforts here. We can do that by cutting red tape that tie the hands of commerce and ensuring Idaho remains competitive in comparison to bordering states, some of which offer lower tax rates. I will report more on Project 60 as we move forward.We enjoy a tremendous quality of life in Idaho. We can maintain, develop and attract talented people to help build and expand our agriculture and energy industries. We also have the potential to grow our medical, technology, and bio-science business. This difficult time will pass and when it does, Idaho will help lead the way in the new economy!State Sen.

173,4PCX-FX80-TW8F-G4NX-00000-00.txt,"Not only did Robert L. Nardelli's appointment as the new head of Chrysler surprise people in the auto industry when it was announced on Monday, it shocked officials inside the auto company as well.   As recently as Aug. 2, Chrysler officials were planning to announce on Monday that Wolfgang Bernhard would become the chairman of Chrysler, people with direct knowledge of those plans said Thursday. They asked not to be identified because the meetings were intended to be private.   While the officials prepared that announcement, they did not know that Mr. Nardelli, a former executive at Home Depot and General Electric, was being courted to replace Thomas W. LaSorda as chief executive, these people said.  Mr. Bernhard, most recently at Volkswagen, served as Chrysler's No.  2 executive earlier this decade and advised Cerberus Capital Management, Chrysler's new owner, in its negotiations with DaimlerChrysler. The deal closed last Friday.  A number of news organizations, including The New York Times, reported Mr. Bernhard's expected return, based on confirmation from within Chrysler.   Instead, on Monday, Chrysler said Mr. Bernhard had turned down the chairman's job for ''family reasons,'' clearing the way for Mr. Nardelli's appointment as both chief executive and chairman. Mr. LaSorda is now the company's No.  2 executive.  A company spokesman declined to comment on Thursday on what those family reasons were. A spokesman for Cerberus had no comment.   People with knowledge of the discussions involving Mr. Bernhard, however, said that Cerberus wanted him to serve with Mr. Nardelli, whose appointment they also planned to announce on Monday.  They said they did not know whether Mr. Nardelli's hiring ultimately played a role in Mr. Bernhard's decision to turn down the position.   Neither Chrysler nor Cerberus has offered more specifics about Mr. Bernhard, who told the two companies last weekend of his decision not to accept the job.  On Monday, Mr. LaSorda said that the discussions with Mr. Nardelli had been under way for about two weeks and that he had offered to accept a demotion if Cerberus decided to appoint another executive in his place.   Mr. LaSorda said he had had several talks with Mr. Nardelli before he accepted the Chrysler job, meaning he was one of only a few people at the company who knew Mr. Nardelli might be joining.  Analysts say the credit squeeze that Cerberus faced when its bankers tried unsuccessfully to sell $10 billion in loans to finance the deal appears to have played a key role in the hiring of Mr. Nardelli.   Cerberus did not comment on reports  this week that bankers had pressured the company to hire an outside executive.   On Wednesday, Automotive News cited speculation at an industry conference in Acme, Mich., outside Traverse City, that the problems in credit markets, which kept bankers from being able to sell $10 billion in loans meant to finance Cerberus's purchase of Chrysler, prompted financiers to push the company to find a cost-cutting specialist.  The five banks involved in the deal, headed by JPMorgan Chase, decided on July 26 to finance $10 billion themselves, with Cerberus and Chrysler each carrying $1 billion.  ''I think Cerberus panicked,'' said Gerald Meyers, the former president at the American Motors Corporation and an expert on crisis management.   He said the problem selling the financing to investors may have prompted Cerberus to grab Mr. Nardelli now rather than give Mr. LaSorda time to get the new company turned around. Mr. Meyers said, ''The timing makes it look that way.'' ",0,,,
174,7V82-PHS0-Y93Y-N211-00000-00.txt,"The call for social reform takes a backseat to the failing economy in times when shouts of ***recession** and rumors of depression fill the minds of many.When social interest groups try to cash in on the promises made by President Barack Obama, they are overshadowed by the economic issues plaguing the nation.Such is the case for gay and lesbian Americans who supported Obama on the campaign trail.Part of the president's campaign platform included the support for gay and lesbian rights. Obama promised to end ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"" a policy prohibiting openly gay people from serving in the military. He also voiced support for granting civil unions to same-sex couples. Before his election, Obama was the most socially liberal senator in Congress, and he did not abandon many of his liberal leanings when he campaigned.Â Those supporting gay rights think it's time for Obama to give more than moral support; they want real change.Activists gathered on Capitol Hill Friday to pressure Obama to repeal the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy and carry out his promises to the gay community.Opponents of gay rights criticize protesters for distracting the president from more pressing issues. Supporters of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" suggest a strong stand on a controversial social issue such as gay rights would distract from Obama's economic agenda and give him unnecessary resistance in other endeavors.If Obama wants to create a nation of inclusion, he must do more than preach about equality. Setting an approximate timeline for the end of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" and the institution of domestic partnership rights for gays and lesbians may be an unpopular decision for Obama. However, setting an agenda for both social and economic reform should be equal priorities of any president.If a person is willing to honor his or her country by serving in the military, that person should have the honor of being honest about his or her sexual orientation. Being in the military requires discipline and patriotism - not heterosexuality.To suggest sexual orientation is that much of a distraction would suggest men and women cannot serve in the military together without being sidetracked by their sexual attractions.Â Such thinking is simply archaic.Â In times this difficult, it's ridiculous to believe any American could lose his or her job and not receive health benefits from his or her partner. It's unreasonable to believe a woman's partner could die, and she could be left with nothing.Gay and lesbians are not some liberal dissidents who want to distract from more important issues.They want to live in this country knowing they could serve in the military and love who they want. They want to know they have the right to protect their families in a time where no one's assets seem safe.Pardon the interruption, Mr. President, but it just doesn't seem like too much to ask.(C) 2008 Daily Kent Stater via UWIRE",1,,,
175,4TS7-8D50-TX12-N1D1-00000-00.txt,"c(""Oct. 25--South Bay home prices continued their steady drop in September, with the areawide median price falling 27.9percent compared with the same month a year ago, said a report released Friday.The South Bay's median price for all homes sold in September was $500,000, compared with $693,500 in September 2007, according to the report by Los Angeles-based California Association of Realtors.The local price drop was less than the countywide decrease of 32.1 percent to a median of $360,000.The median price refers to the figure at which half of homes sold for more and half for less.Home prices fell throughout California even as the number of properties sold skyrocketed 96.7 percent compared with a year ago.\""This dramatic increase in sales owes as much to market weakness a year ago in the early stages of the credit crunch, as it does to the growth of sales in September this year,\"" CAR President William E. Brown said in a release. \""Similar increases occurred in the early 1980s when the market was climbing out of a comparatively steep downturn in sales.\""Of the South Bay communities cited in the report, San Pedro saw the most severe drop in median price, by 33.5 percent, to $412,000.\""I think what's really happening is with the waves of foreclosures and bank-owned properties, the ripples are finally hitting this area,\"" said Kim Howard, a Realtor who works mostly in San Pedro. \""It started in Riverside and Diamond Bar ,and then it hit Carson and it finally hit us.\""Howard, who works with Re/Max Execs Palos Verdes, said she expects home prices to slowly stabilize in the second quarter of next year and possibly start to turn around by 2010.Robert Petersen, a Realtor with ERA Golden West Realty, blamed the previous run-up in San Pedro home prices for September's dramatic slump.\""When an area becomes more desirable and more people go to it, the prices increase,\"" said Petersen, whose office is in San Pedro. \""It went up a lot. And when everything turned around, it's going to get harder hit in the downturn.\""Inglewood also suffered a major price drop, at 31.3 percent, with the September median falling to $299,000.Carson's median price dropped 27.3percent to $360,000.Torrance's median price fell 18.5 percent to $481,000.The Palos Verdes Peninsula's price drop was a relatively mild 5.6 percent to $1,075,000.Bucking the trend, the median price in the beach cities rose 2.1 percent to $995,000 in September. However, this figure may have been skewed by a disproportionately large number of higher-end homes selling that month.Statewide, the median price of only existing, single-family detached homes dropped 40.9 percent in September to $316,480.\""There is still no clear sign that the statewide median price has begun to stabilize, and recent events in the economy and financial system undoubtedly contributed to the steep decline in September, both directly and through weakened consumer confidence,\"" Leslie Appleton-Young, CAR vice president and chief economist, said in a release. \""However, individual markets may be faring better than the statewide median at this time.muhammed.el-hasan@dailybreeze.comTo see more of the Daily Breeze or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.dailybreeze.com.

At the same time, property tax collections across the USA rose 3.1%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).State and local governments are on track to collect more than $400 billion in property taxes this year, the most ever.  One reason: Laws in most states that prevent big tax hikes when property values soar also block big tax drops when values sink.The housing market collapse has caused a ***recession** that's hurt sales and income tax collections. But property taxes -- collected mostly for public schools -- have escaped serious damage.  As a result, public education is one of the few sectors of the economy still adding jobs.""Property taxes aren't always popular, but they are a very stable tax, even in tough times,"" says Thomas Gentzel, executive director of the Pennsylvania School Board Association.Property taxes haven't fallen since 1934, the BEA says.What's keeping property taxes up while home prices fall:*Property tax limits. Most states cap how fast taxes rise in boom times. In bad times, the same laws keep taxes from falling and even permit modest increases on most homes.Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada -- the four states hit hardest when overheated real estate markets crashed and triggered waves of foreclosures -- all have tax laws that work this way.Tonight Show host Jay Leno's property taxes on his Beverly Hills home will increase $1,500 this year to $54,000, even though home values in the area fell by one-third since last year, California public records show.  Reason: His mansion is taxed based on the $2.5 million purchase price in 1987, plus 2% annual increases.Nevada schools will collect $730 million in property taxes this year, up 5%, says James Wells, Nevada deputy school superintendent.  ""Property taxes are a bright spot.  Sales taxes are the problem,"" he says.*Delayed appraisals. Most states are slow to change the assessed value of homes. Some Pennsylvania counties haven't done major reappraisals for decades. Elsewhere, homeowners must pay taxes on peak values for years before new assessments reflect plunging prices.Colorado residents will pay taxes in 2010 and 2011 based on what their homes were worth in the first half of 2008.

A near-Biblical storm raged outside.Jackie Calmes, a national reporter for The New York Times, told an audience of several hundred at the Senator John Heinz History Center in the Strip District that her editors had discouraged her from using allegedly hyperbolic words such as \""unprecedented\"" and \""historic\"" in describing the economy.\""I was told that we don't do that at the Times, and I said that sometimes things are unprecedented; things are historic,\"" she said.The discussion came in the second of a series of town meetings sponsored by the Post-Gazette and PNC.

She noted that the debt incurred in the government stimulus measures, while daunting, paled beside the longer-term deficit consequences of the nation's health-care spending.She added that while the Obama health-care prescription was still \""woefully short of details,\"" it had profited from lessons of the failed Clinton administration reform effort. She noted that Mr. Obama, in contrast, had emphasized the need to cover the uninsured as a tool to contain costs, rather than as a goal in itself.Mr. Dye, the economist, noted that the forbidding weather visible through the windows behind him seemed to reflect the reputation of his field as \""the dismal science.\"" He was, however, somewhat more optimistic than other panelists on the future of the economy.\""For the first time in the last 18 months, it does look like the end is in sight in terms of this ***recession**,\"" he said.""

183,4SWP-T000-TX2Y-K0BM-00000-00.txt,"The lure of $613 million in state tax-relief funds for public education has proved irresistible to every school district in the state - except one.Eastern Lancaster County school board May 29 voted against accepting the district's share of the money - $441,818 - because it was generated through slot-machine gambling.In a 5-3 vote, the board rejected the funds and condemned gambling, saying Elanco should not be associated in any manner with the social ills associated with slot machine operations.We just felt it was a really strong moral issue, school board president Loren Martin said. As an individual, I am opposed to funding public education with gambling revenue. I think it's a foolish path to go down.The decision was difficult in a sense because of the economic times we're going through, board member Thomas Wentzel said.But just judging from the people I've talked to - I'm a farmer - a lot of people in the community are dead set against (gambling).The board's action means the owners of 6,644 properties who qualified for a farmstead or homestead exemption won't get a $66.53 reduction on their tax bills for 2008-09.If the funding had been accepted, it would have nearly offset the $69 increase in school taxes the average Elanco property owner will pay in 2008-09.Under state law, the school district now must ask residents to decide if the district will accept tax-relief money in 2009-10. A referendum question will be placed on the Nov. 4 general election ballot.But to school board member Alex Sitar, residents already have voted - by seeking homestead/farmstead exemptions, which qualify them for tax relief.Seventy-two percent of all Elanco property owners sought and received exemptions, indicating that most people in the community want slots-funded tax relief, he said.My feeling is we had no right to vote on it, he said. It's up to each individual home-owner to decide if it's right.Those who oppose gambling should not apply for an exemption, he said, or should give the money to charity.Instead of leaving the decision up to each resident, the school board took matters into its own hands, Sitar said.Their feeling is they don't like gambling money, and we need to send a message to Harrisburg - and that was it, Sitar said. I was shocked.I think once people know what happened, they're going to be livid. It doesn't sound like a lot (of money), but in this time, why would we do that? That's crazy. That's a tankful of gas.Even if voters in November reject the board's action, Elanco can't recoup the $441,818 earmarked for the district in 2008-09. That money has been returned to the statewide funding pool for next year's tax relief.Joining Sitar in opposing the board resolution were Glenn Yoder and Theresa Clay. The five who supported the measure were Wentzel, Martin, Charles Trupe, Debra Reimers and Rosanna Hersh.The ninth member, Richard Caswell, was not at the meeting.Martin said he understands how board members would be tempted to take the money in light of the recent ***economic downturn**.But residents won't stand for it, he said.We do have a lot of folks in our community who have spoken out in the past to say that we don't want to have our school funded by gambling and that we don't support gambling, he said.I think it's kind of ironic that we bring something into the state that creates social problems in our families, and we're using it to fund education.It just doesn't make a lot of sense.E-mail: bwallace@lnpnews.com",0,,,

185,4SBS-FW40-TWD8-K0S7-00000-00.txt,"NEW LONDONWHAT A DIFFERENCE three years makes. In spring of 2005, credit-card companies were on the offensive, pushing through a tough new bankruptcy bill aimed at preventing  irresponsible borrowers  from getting rid of their debts.Today, the same companies are playing defense. Credit-card reform legislation has been introduced in the House and Senate, and both Democratic presidential candidates are talking about pushing back restrictions on bankruptcy.There are at least three reasons for this new attack on the credit-card industry. First, we have a Democratic Congress with the power to call hearings and make some progress (up to the point of presidential signature or overturning his veto) on banking-reform legislation. Second, the subprime-***mortgage crisis** has given the lending industry in general a bad name. Finally, for several years, starting well before today s economic woes, credit-card companies in particular have been the object of growing consumer outrage.On the list of hated businesses, this one falls somewhere between used-car dealers and cigarette makers. Our anger toward the credit-card companies arises in large measure because of the many abuses they have engaged in, such as  universal default,  in which falling behind on some other obligation can trigger jacked up interest rates on your credit card, even when you have a perfect payment record. But how did we let this industry introduce such pernicious practices in the first place? Why do we let these folks get away with things we would never tolerate in any other business?The answer lies in our love-hate relationship with plastic. It s like free money. A license to kill. Exchangeable for anything at any time   no trip to the ATM required. Furthermore, the combination of low minimum payments and revolving credit makes it feel painless. Only credit cards can give us anything under the sun today, while putting the cost of consumption off into the murky future. We accept the abuses these companies dish out because we love what they give us in return. We pay what the market will bear.Perhaps the recent changes in the economic and political winds mean the market will bear a little less. But the industry takes comfort in the knowledge that we can t give up the card. Plastic is ubiquitous and fully integrated into our lives. A true necessity. Today, American consumers face a growing list of economic challenges. Many are struggling to stay afloat in the face of declining wages and inadequate health-care coverage. But through it all, credit cards continue to be one of our most abiding financial challenges. Combined with retail innovations, such as 800-numbers and Internet shopping, they make every waking moment a potential spending opportunity. Credit cards give us the willies. We love what they do for us during the day, but they often keep us up at night.Credit cards have long been the engine of bankruptcy, and because many people cashed out equity from their homes to cover credit-card debt during the real-estate boom, they are also a hidden aspect of our current mortgage difficulties. Undoubtedly many people now regret squandering their home equity on long-forgotten meals and movie tickets put on their credit cards, but they loved the convenience at the time. Plastic is a very tricky product. We love it, but it sometimes brings out the worst in us. And, although credit-card reform would be a very good thing, it will not resolve our troubled love-hate relationship with the card.Stuart Vyse, an occasional contributor, is a professor of psychology at Connecticut College and author of Going Broke: Why American s Can t Hold on to Their Money.

186,7W70-7JG1-2R4D-P021-00000-00.txt,"Georgia's dismal high school graduation rate has reached a ""crisis"" level, according to a national report released Wednesday. The authors recommended immediate federal action.Entitled ""Graduating America: Meeting the Challenge of Low Graduation-Rate High Schools,"" the report puts Georgia among 17 states with the lowest overall graduation rates in the country.""The likelihood that any student is assigned to a school where graduation is not the norm is alarmingly high,"" said Adria Steinberg, a co-author of the report using 2005-2006 data. The report was released by the Jobs for the Future advocacy group and the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University --- a think-tank working to focus attention on the national problem.Researchers found that one-third of Georgia high schools have low graduation rates and that those 130 schools are not limited to urban areas: 32 are in cities, 36 are in the suburbs and 37 are in rural areas. ""Improving the state's graduation rate is the No. 1 strategic goal for education in our state,"" said Dana Tofig, spokesman for the Georgia Department of Education. ""The good news is we've seen improvement over the past several years, but we still have too many kids who are dropping out.""While high schools with low graduation rates exist in every state and in many communities, they are concentrated in 17 states that produce about 70 percent of the nation's dropouts, the study found.""The go-it-alone approach of leaving failing schools to fix themselves has not worked,"" said co-author Robert Balfanz of the Everyone Graduates Center. ""With the federal government ready to invest billions of dollars into turning around low-performing schools, the time is right to form the federal, state and local partnerships needed to transform or replace the low graduation-rate high schools that drive the nation's dropout crisis.""Georgia was one of five states with the worst graduation rates. The others are Florida, Nevada, New Mexico and South Carolina.Overall, Georgia's rate has improved slightly from 75.3 percent to 77.8 percent from 2008 to 2009.Some schools, not surprisingly, report far lower rates, including some alternative schools.In Gwinnett County, Phoenix High, an alternative campus, had a 42.6 percent graduation rate. Cobb County's Oakwood High, an open campus in Marietta attracting students with academic or family issues that make them uncomfortable in traditional learning environments, saw its graduation rate fall from 67.2 percent in 2008 to 55.1 percent in 2009.But low rates were not limited to alternative schools.In Gwinnett, for example, Meadowcreek High had a 64.5 percent rate and Central Gwinnett High was below the state average at 72.7.Like Georgia, nearly half the 17 states probed showed some improvement during the study period.North Carolina gained some traction, the report said, and became a leader in innovation with the New School Project, a public-private partnership that created up to 100 small schools designed to help students earn a high school diploma and an associate's degree, tuition free, in five years.The other half of the states with lowest rates saw rates level off or become worse.In most, the high schools with the lowest graduation rates served mostly poor and minority students. African-Americans and Hispanics in Georgia and elsewhere, the report said, are more likely than white students to attend schools with low graduation rates.The graduation rate for African-Americans in Georgia this year was 72.6 percent and for Hispanics it was 69 percent. Those rates showed improvement but still lagged behind whites, who had an 82.1 percent graduation rate.President Barack Obama has linked improving high school graduation rates to restoring the nation's economic and political standing in the world.The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is pumping billions of dollars into efforts intended to turn around low-performing schools and has laid groundwork for government agencies to work together.But improving graduation rates, the report said, will require understanding the geographic spread and concentration of these schools and characteristics of the districts, schools and students. To be successful, co-author Steinberg said, states and districts need access to the growing knowledge base of what works and where it works.""It would be a waste of precious resources to quickly scale up interventions that were successful in one place without carefully analyzing the conditions that make success possible and understanding which innovations work under what circumstances,"" she said.In Georgia, improving graduation rates will require approaching the problem from many different fronts, spokesman Tofig said. ""We have to improve the data we're gathering and analyzing.""",0,,,

He also pledged to make the county more attractive to new businesses by streamlining the start-up process, which he said currently is full of bureaucratic hurdles.""I want to create a one-stop shop for anybody trying to start, expand or improve their business,"" Renckert said.

Johnson administration officials alleged two attacks on two separate days. We now know there was just one incident   and the U.S. was on offense, not defense. Johnson used the incident to drum up congressional support for dramatically escalating U.S. military involvement in Vietnam   a bad decision that generated an unpopular war, damaged his reputation, and ultimately cost him his job.Ronald Reagan, praised excessively for his assertive role in  winning  the Cold War, in the process helped create the biggest threat to the American homeland since the War of 1812: al-Qaida. Reagan, in his anti-communist zeal, also secretly subverted the central power retained by Congress under the Constitution   the decision to fund federal programs   during the Iran-Contra affair.As Zachary Karabell, biographer of President Chester Arthur, lamented,  Presidents who govern during time of calm and prosperity often suffer the barbs of history  and are either ignored, or written off as inconsequential. Those who adopt an active response when faced with major problems generally are deemed heroic   even if their response was the wrong one or the calamity was partly (or totally) of their own making.A biographer of President James Polk, John Seigenthaler, has written that  presidents who combine a mesmeric personality with dynamic performance in times of crises  usually are rated the highest.The truth is that most presidential scholars have a bias toward activism rather than outcomes. A president who creates new government programs to deal with societal problems will generally be seen as a better president than one who deals more cautiously   and cost-effectively   with problems. This is true even if those programs do little good, or even exacerbate the problems. Thus, despite Vietnam, President Johnson is viewed by many as a well-above-average president because he also declared war on poverty with a multitude of Great Society income-transfer programs, from Food Stamps, enacted in 1964, to Medicaid and Medicare, which became law a year later.As we now realize, many of Roosevelt s economic-recovery programs were wasteful and ineffective. And many of Johnson s Great Society programs increased government dependency among the poor and made poverty more intractable. Yet, FDR and LBJ consistently are rated ahead of President Martin Van Buren, a low-key chief executive who promoted recovery from the economic panic of 1837 by using restraint in government and letting the market correct itself. This very restraint should earn Van Buren high marks.Presidential performance ratings should be based on results   not rhetoric, personality, popularity, preference for basketball over bowling, or even crisis-management abilities, except to the extent that these qualities produce the right outcomes.Results, moreover, should be measured not by the number of new laws passed or the number of new international  partners  the president aligns with the United States, but by the degree to which his actions, or deliberate inaction, contribute to peace, prosperity and liberty, which should be every president s priority.Ivan Eland, author of the newly published book, Recarving Rushmore: Ranking the Presidents on Peace, Prosperity and Liberty, is a senior fellow at the Independent Institute ( www.independent.org), based in Oakland, Calif.",0,,,
189,7W3B-W0V1-2PBB-20F2-00000-00.txt,"c(""Some people from this country despair at the rigid choreography of what might be called the Myanmar diplomatic minuet. United Nations interlocutors come and go, declaring that the moment is at hand for the military junta to release the endlessly prosecuted Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, but the generals do not budge.   Over the weekend, it was Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, who, despite the weight of his personal intervention, failed to secure so much as a chat with Asia's most famous political prisoner, much less any concessions.   The fact that Mr. Ban emerged empty-handed after his two-day visit that ended Saturday provides the strongest evidence yet that a different approach is overdue, analysts of Myanmar said.   Rather than tying negotiations, not to mention sanctions, to the treatment of just one figure, say policy analysts, humanitarian workers and exiles, the world should engage the junta on a broad range of economic, humanitarian and ethnic issues that will return electoral politics to its rightful place as one concern among many. They admit that borders on heresy, considering Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's virtual beatification in the West, but they consider it a shift she would readily accept given her lifelong commitment to solving Myanmar's problems.  ''People are angry with the U.N. because how many missions have we seen over the past 20 years jetting in and out,'' said Aung Zaw, who went into exile after the bloody 1988 uprising and is now the Thailand-based editor of Irrawaddy magazine. ''Have they produced any progress?''   Mr. Ban took a stab at articulating a new policy toward Myanmar, formerly Burma, in an unusual speech on Saturday to the humanitarian and diplomatic community. He called on the government to respect human rights, address the dire humanitarian needs in the wake of Cyclone Nargis that killed about 130,000 people in May 2008 and try to join the rest of Asia's economic tigers.   But for the bulk of his visit, Mr. Ban focused on pushing for free and fair elections, and the release of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and some 2,000 other political prisoners.   What is missing from this approach, analysts note, is a vision of Myanmar as seen by Senior Gen. Than Shwe and the other four generals who together make up the ruling State Peace and Development Council. General Than Shwe views himself as having shut down a failed socialist system; opened up the country to foreign gas companies that discovered reserves worth billions of dollars; signed cease-fires with some 20 ethnic groups in guerrilla wars that  lasted since independence from Britain in 1948; and pushed through a new Constitution that enshrines military control of the country behind a civilian leadership.  Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's sweeping national following makes her a threat to this plan. But analysts said they believed that as military men, the generals worry far more about insurgent armies financed by narco-trafficking, including the 20,000-strong United Wa State Army in the north and the Kachin Independence Army, with 10,000 men.  Senior United Nations officials are dismissive about addressing the armed conflicts, saying their General Assembly mandate  covers only political matters. But critics argue that they are being too timid.   ''I think we need a more general view of the problems in the country,'' said Thant Myint-U, the author of a Burmese history titled ''The River of Lost Footsteps'' and a former United Nations official. ''Some new agreement between the Burmese Army and its armed opponents is essential for new elections. The opponents with the guns are in many ways more important to them than the opponents who are locked up.''  Western attempts at isolation combined with the endless domestic civil war have made the generals comfortable in their siege mentality, analysts said. A prime way to bust through that would be humanitarian aid, though analysts say the United Nations has failed to convince donor nations of its importance. In Mr. Ban's ''Five Plus One'' pillars for Myanmar, humanitarian aid comes after various aspects of political freedom and economic development.   Given Myanmar's pariah status, countries have balked at providing aid for recovery and reconstruction. Emergency relief after Cyclone Nargis came quickly, but donors have pledged only about $100 million of the more than $600 million sought for the next phase, said Catherine Bragg, the deputy United Nations humanitarian coordinator.   A report last fall by the International Crisis Group said that aid should be seen not only as a means to alleviate suffering, ''but also as a potential means of opening up a closed country, improving governance and empowering people to take control of their own lives.''   It has worked that way at least in the Irrawaddy Delta -- the area hit hardest by the cyclone -- where villagers have adopted a modicum of self-governance through being consulted by foreign or local organizations on issues ranging from divvying up donated tractors to revamping school curriculums.   As a result, the junta has grown wary, clamping down on visas for foreign aid workers. There is a backlog of more than 200, and 100 recently granted were just one-month extensions, Ms. Bragg said.  While some advocacy groups support lifting sanctions, they want it done in a way that helps economically vulnerable groups like textile workers and farmers. ''It shouldn't be about automatically repealing the sanctions and giving a lot of money to the regime -- that would be folly,'' said David Mathieson, the Myanmar researcher for Human Rights Watch.   United Nations members are deeply divided over Myanmar, with important trading partners like Russia and China protective of the regime and other Asian neighbors often mute. The United States is reviewing its own policy of economic and other sanctions. At his confirmation hearings last month, Kurt M. Campbell, the highest State Department official for East Asia, said that the review had been enormously complicated by the fact that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was again on trial, but that Washington was looking for ''a more constructive approach.''   The hurdle, of course, is that the country's star dissident has developed a worldwide following. ''Aung San Suu Kyi is the 800-pound gorilla in Burma,'' said Maureen Aung-Thwin of the International Crisis Group. ''Everything that happens -- elections, the political process, reconciliation -- is inexorably linked to her.''"", 
""The Memo From Myanmar article on Monday about diplomatic failures to win the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader held by the military junta, misidentified the organizational affiliation of a regional expert who said Aung San Suu Kyi's global prominence makes her Myanmar's ''800-pound gorilla.'' The expert, Maureen Aung-Thwin, is the director of the Burma Project/Southeast Asia Initiative of the Open Society Institute. She is not with the International Crisis Group.""

190,7V0W-TMH0-Y92T-G20F-00000-00.txt,"The following editorial was published by the Christian Science Monitor: Hillary Clinton chose Asia, particularly China, for her maiden voyage next week as secretary of state. While the most urgent issue is Beijing's help to end a global ***recession**, Clinton's more planet-saving goal is to enlist China to set curbs on its carbon emissions. Without that, President Barack Obama may not be able to win enough Senate votes for a cap on U.S. greenhouse gases. As the world's two largest emitters, China and the United States will set the pace this year among all nations in make-or-break negotiations for a post-Kyoto treaty on global warming. The talks end this December with a summit in Copenhagen. If the world is to make a commitment to fight climate change, each of these giant polluters needs to know the other will jump into the same chilly pool of obligatory curbs on their tailpipes and smokestacks. But if China isn't making much of a sacrifice, many U.S. senators, especially those from coal states, may not support CO2 cuts or a treaty seen as reducing U.S. competitiveness. China says it and other developing countries deserve to be allowed to pollute for a while to catch up to modern standards. Clinton must break this standoff. The bleak future that each country faces in a warming planet isn't all that different. And working together on climate change might even draw them closer. Both countries have taken a long time to wake up to the task. Obama's election ushers in a drive for a ""green"" economy. And since 2005, Beijing has made some efforts to rein in its worst polluters, if only for the sake of not letting the local damage hinder growth or to quell rising environmental protests that challenge the party itself. But China has two problems that may keep it from satisfying the U.S. Rather than slow its economy with emission caps, it wants the West to give it advanced energy technology, such as ""clean"" coal plants. That's a cost the U.S. may not be willing to bear given the energy investments it needs. The second is that the Communist Party, despite its green intentions, seems unable to control local chiefs in the provinces who are rewarded for growth and often ignore party mandates. And many of them are part owners in polluting factories. A top-down campaign against CO2 is likely to fail. Until Beijing allows local democracy ? and full freedom for citizen activists ? there won't be enough public pressure on these local chiefs. While Beijing has tolerated a blossoming of environmental groups since 1994, it keeps a rein on them, fearing they may spark a ""green"" revolt against the regime. Clinton needs to push China to loosen those reins and allow political and media freedom. She can start by asking for the release of Wu Lihong, a prominent activist who was given a three-year sentence in 2007 after leading a campaign against pollution in the home province of President Hu Jintao. His release would signal a new freedom for eco-advocacy. Just as millions of Americans now pressure their leaders for action on global warming, China needs millions of courageous activists like Wu Lihong. For want of a dissident released, a planet should not be lost.  ",0,,,

Though he's confident he will ride out the tough times because he owns his store, he worries for shopkeepers who pay rent.""It's going to be a lot different environment out there in the next year or so,"" Ritzius said.Mayor Scott Alexander recognizes the problems facing local merchants and is developing a plan to stimulate Haddon Heights' economy by promoting and improving the Station Avenue downtown district.Alexander said the plan would include continued aesthetic improvements, such as refurbished sidewalks, and the development of projects that mix housing and businesses. ""Our town needs to reinvest in the community so we can enhance the well-being and quality of life in our town,"" he said.Alexander, who has extensive professional marketing experience, sent a survey to all Haddon Heights residents in November, asking them to rate their satisfaction with the borough in 20 categories. He said he figured: ""Let's start to look at our borough in more detail and understand what the issues are in town.""Among categories that fell short of average satisfaction were ""quality of Station Avenue Business District"" and ""amount and quality of economic development.""Alexander said that he considered borough residents customers and that the survey method was the best way to directly address their concerns. He said his economic-revitalization plan would be based on their feedback.Alexander said his plan would aim to draw people to the quaint, historic downtown, which is lined with shops and restaurants. The problem, he said, is improving Station Avenue without raising taxes or asking for more state aid. The answer is harnessing the financial potency of Station Avenue, he said.His plan will have a public-relations aspect, getting people to ""shop Haddon Heights first,"" Alexander said.Alexander said many Station Avenue stores offered basic necessities. They might sometimes have slightly higher prices than some of the chains, but he wants to encourage residents to give local stores a chance.""People have to spend,"" he said. ""And if you're going to spend what you have to spend, spend it here.""Alexander is using the borough's publication, the Heights Report, to promote local shops. The free paper is delivered to all households.The mayor is also considering selling some borough-owned empty lots and putting the profits into investment accounts that can be used to pay for downtown revitalization. Sidewalks have already been improved, and Alexander is looking to extend them farther along Station Avenue.He would like to see more mixed residential/commercial properties along Station Avenue. He said other local towns had gotten economic boosts from similar strategies.Karen Cilurso, senior regional planner with the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, said the success rate of initiatives like Alexander's was usually around 50 percent.""I think the success depends on the leadership,"" Cilurso said. She said real change would have to be made through town zoning. She said local towns had benefited from bringing in large anchor chains such as CVS or Starbucks. As for some of the mixed-use development plans, Cilurso said: ""There's no market there right now. People just aren't buying.""Still, she said, towns have to plan.She also said new apartments would be valuable housing options in a more stable economic climate. She noted that many single-family houses in Haddon Heights were expensive and that apartments would be affordable options for families moving in.The fact that Station Avenue already has apartments is a bonus, she said.Cilurso added that her commission had named Haddon Heights a ""Classic Town of Greater Philadelphia,"" highlighting it as a great place to live, work, and play. She said that designation would help with Alexander's plan to attract new residents.John Johnson, owner and operator of John's Friendly Market, said he liked Alexander's strategy. His grocery store, which he casually described as ""a clearinghouse for town gossip,"" stocks many staples.""Little shops in little towns like this are having a hard time surviving,"" Johnson said. He added that despite that trend, his business had improved. He speculated that people were dining out less and were coming to rely on some of the quick-meal options his store offers.Contact staff writer Joseph Hannan at 856-779-3990 or jhannan@phillynews.com.

The rest of the industry faced similar trends with shipments of single-engine piston aircraft worldwide dropping from about 2,400 in 2007 to about 1,800 in 2008.Duquette said industry analysis indicates the market will bottom out by the end of this year or in 2010. It should recover to 2006 levels within the next 24 to 30 months, he said, though the recovery of the economy would have a lot of say in that.Wouters told city leaders that the company has survived the worst and is working aggressively to expand its market and invest in new technology. He said he anticipates sales will be 300 to 453 in 2010. That would be enough to bring Cirrus Design back to profitable status, according to data he presented.The number of employees, though, would probably not match earlier levels when Cirrus Design was selling as many aircraft. Wouters made a point that the company has made aggressive cuts, including in employment, and found new efficiencies. Wouters confirmed the company would not need the same number of employees to make the same number of aircraft as before.The efficiencies, though, mean it takes fewer aircraft sales to increase profits.Wouters said selling just 500 aircraft would probably be enough to generate record profits.City leaders, meeting as the Jobs Development Authority, deferred to the Growth Fund Committee to negotiate the details of Cirrus' repayment to the city. The fund is used to offer incentives to encourage businesses to expand or move to the area, including industrial space.Reach Tran at (701) 780-1248; (800) 477-6572, ext. 248; or send e-mail to ttran@gfherald.comTo see more of the Grand Forks Herald, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.grandforks.com.

Every person currently doing business with Morse is being asked to participate in his plan to balance his budget by the end of fiscal 2010.For example, Morse plans to stop paying co-pays for prescription drugs and doctors visits, and is cutting his $100 emergency-room payment in half, with a projected annual savings of $2,600.These fees are simply unsustainable. Supermarkets are being asked to lower their prices until this ***economic crisis** passes, realizing an additional $1,380 in annual savings. Wait staff in area restaurants will no longer receive the customary 15 percent tip; 8 percent will now be the norm. Morse will defer payments to the Warwick Sewer Authority pending a decision in small-claims court regarding a fire hydrant occupying space on his property. Morse has long maintained that water is ridiculously expensive; the judge s ruling should absolve him of any payments exceeding $500, realizing an additional $700 in yearly savings.All work performed at Morse s house will be subject to a 20 percent co-pay by the person doing the work. Plumbers, electricians and all other contract labor will adhere to these new cost-saving measures until the ***economic crisis** passes. This plan will save the Morse budget in two ways: The contractors will charge less for work performed because their co-pay will also be less. Appliance repairmen with their gold-plated  service  fees will no longer be tolerated   a set hourly fee will be paid.Charitable contributions will cease immediately. Also, all pets will be asked to leave.The plan calls for full participation by all. If Morse can achieve concessions this year, his ***financial crisis** will be averted, placing him in a better position for fiscal 2011.MICHAEL MORSEWarwickThe writer is a member of the Providence Fire Department.",1,,,
200,4RNY-H7H0-TWDH-R0WP-00000-00.txt,"With unprecedented speed and cooperation, Congress and the White House forged a deal Thursday to begin rushing tax rebates of $600 to $1,200 to most tax filers by spring, hoping they will spend the money just as quickly and jolt the ailing economy to life.Rebates would be even higher for families with children.The one-time tax rebates are at the center of a hard-won agreement to pump about $150 billion into the economy this year and perhaps stave off the first ***recession** since 2001.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Republican leader John Boehner and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson worked out the details in negotiations that stretched into Wednesday night at the Capitol.About two-thirds of the tax relief would go out in rebate checks to 117 million families beginning in May. Businesses would get $50 billion in incentives to invest in new plants and equipment.Individual taxpayers would get up to $600 in rebates, working couples $1,200 and those with children an additional $300 per child under the agreement. In a key concession to Democrats, 35 million families who make at least $3,000 but don't pay taxes would get $300 rebates.The rebates would phase out gradually for individuals whose adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000 and for couples with incomes above $150,000. Contributions to IRA and 401(k) retirement accounts and health savings accounts would not count toward the income limit.""This package will lead to higher consumer spending and increased business investment,"" Bush said in hailing the agreement.Democrats' dissentThe bill will go straight to the House floor next week and on to the Senate, where some Democrats hope to add elements such as extending unemployment benefits for workers whose benefits have run out.Indeed, many Democrats, such as Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, the liberal lion of the Senate, were deeply unhappy that Pelosi agreed to jettison that proposal in late-stage talks, as well as plans to increase food stamp payments.""I do not understand, and cannot accept, the resistance of President Bush and Republican leaders to including an extension of unemployment benefits for those who are without work through no fault of their own,"" Rangel said.The administration signaled it's unlikely to welcome efforts to broaden the measure, and pressure was mounting in the Senate to accept the hard-won deal.""The American people are not going to have a lot of patience for taking time,"" Paulson said.If the Senate gives quick approval, the first rebate payments could begin going out in May and most people could have them by July, he said.It has become increasingly clear that the economy is teetering on the edge of ***recession**, if it hasn't already gone over that line. The crisis in subprime home loans has hit hard at many lending institutions, cramping credit for almost everyone else. Economic growth has all but disappeared, companies are reporting big losses and Wall Street had been tumbling day after day - even after emergency Federal Reserve rate-cutting - until Wednesday's hopeful talk about the stimulus deal. The Dow Jones industrial average was up more than 100 points Thursday after soaring nearly 300 the day before.In addition to concerns openly expressed by lawmakers, members of Congress are not eager to run for re-election this fall with voters fearful of losing jobs in a ***recession**.Benefits for businessesFor businesses, the stimulus measure would allow immediate tax write-offs for 50 percent of the purchase price of plants and other capital equipment and permit small businesses to write off additional purchases of equipment. A provision to allow businesses suffering losses now to reclaim taxes previously paid was dropped.Pelosi, D-Calif., agreed to drop increases in food stamp and unemployment benefits in exchange for gaining the rebates of at least $300 for almost everyone earning a paycheck, including those who make too little to pay income taxes.""I can't say that I'm totally pleased with the package, but I do know that it will help stimulate the economy. But if it does not, then there will be more to come,"" Pelosi said. She said that House Democrats may act on other proposals to stimulate the economy, particularly if it worsens in coming weeks.Boehner said the agreement ""was not easy for the two of us and our respective caucuses.""""You know, many Americans believe that Washington is broken,"" the Ohio Republican said. ""But I think this agreement and I hope that this agreement will show the American people that we can fix it.""Paulson said he would work with the House and Senate to enact the package and declared that ""speed is of the essence."" He cautioned that ""the work is far from over.""",1,,,

Shortly after the nuclear-waste company went public last winter, the closing price reached its 52-week high of $28.45.EnergySolutionsdid not respond Friday and Monday to requests to explain the price decline.Meanwhile, company officials have been meeting and speaking with analysts about the market developments in the past week.Ben Elias, an analyst with the brokerage firm Stearne, Agee &amp; Leach, said he spoke Monday with EnergySolutions' Tim Barney, investor relations officer. But Elias still could not say why EnergySolutionshas seen such a steep decline and suggested it was simply a reflection of broader market woes. Still, he said EnergySolutionsremains basically solid and on track to deliver the projected earnings of about 77 cents per share this year.Nonetheless, a 50 percent slump \""is a big deal because it's an overreaction,\"" he said.Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Morgan Securities suggested investors might be trying to \""get comfortable\"" with projected earnings for the year. \""I think there's time for things to turn up,\"" he said.During an August teleconference on second-quarter results, EnergySolutionschief executive officer R. Steve Creamer said that the company was on track for $1.8 to $1.9 billion in revenues this year. Since then, strides have been made on a number of key projects, including plans worth an estimated $900 million to take over the Zion nuclear power plant in Illinois for decommissioning.At the same time, its bid to clean up Italian nuclear facilities remains tangled in legal controversy, and federal regulators have not approved a change that would allow greater access to nuclear plant decommissioning funds.Here in Utah, the company's Tooele County disposal facility has reported a dramatic slowdown that has big implications for state and local government.Tooele County, for instance, is collecting less in \""mitigation fees,\"" which have amounted to as much as one-quarter of the county budget some years.County Auditor Michael Jensen estimated the county expects about $1.5 million less in mitigation fees from EnergySolutionsthis calendar year. In 2006, the county received $6.1 million, $8.7 million in 2006 and $12 million in 2005, he said.\""Luckily, right now we have a pretty good fund balance,\"" he said. But he and commissioners have already discussed the possibility that, in the future, costs might need to be cut or taxes raised to cover expenses.The state Department of Environmental Quality is also feeling the pinch. It uses fees from nuclear waste largely to cover oversight in the Solid and Hazardous Waste and Radiation Control divisions.Budget officer Steve Higley noted that fees from radioactive waste have dropped from $2,853,846 in 2006 to $751,926 for the 2008 budget year, which ended June 30.fahys@sltrib.comTo see more of The Salt Lake Tribune, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.sltrib.com.

202,7WK9-6XF0-YB35-R2HR-00000-00.txt,"Huntington Bancshares has announced plans to issue up to $150 million in stock, in what could be a burgeoning model for capital-hungry banks looking to avoid overly diluting their shares.Though Huntington executives stressed that this sale would bring to a close the capital-raising efforts it began in May, some analysts said the Columbus, Ohio, company might be testing the market for a series of bite-size, common stock offerings to bolster its still relatively weak capital levels.""The economy could recover terrifically. Credit losses could drop suddenly. But if that doesn't happen, they are going to want or need another billion dollars,"" said Tom Mitchell, a senior analyst who covers financial stocks for Miller Tabak &amp; Co. LLC. ""I think this will probably end up being a perpetual offer - $150 million is, I think, a drop in the bucket.""Trying to raise $1 billion in a single common stock offering - with the potential for massive dilution - would be bad for the company and its investors, especially when its shares are trading at such a low price, he said.Mitchell said this deal could be part of an emerging trend; it closely resembles a $250 million stock offering Zions Bancorp. closed in late August. This transaction, like the Zions deal, is relatively small, he said. It is also structured in a way that lets the sales agent in both - Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. - unload shares in deals over several weeks to avoid flooding the market in a single offering.""This is a procedure they could repeat if they found it had been attractive,"" Mitchell said. ""I would bet that this kind of approach would be attractive to many banks that have low stock prices ... but have a legitimate need for capital and are not close to going under.""For their part, Huntington executives said that the offering would complete plans to increase the company's common equity by $675 million in the capital-raising initiative it announced May 20. It had raised only $585 million. This offer will close that gap, according to Jay Gould, Huntington's director of investor relations.""All it will give us is a little more cushion,"" he said.He declined to comment on whether Huntington might have to raise more capital.Stephen Steinour, Huntington's chairman and chief executive, sounded an upbeat note about the latest offering.""Today's action sets the stage for fully achieving our capital objectives,"" Steinour said in a press release.""Huntington intends to use net proceeds of sales under the program for general corporate purposes, including the possible repurchase of outstanding debt.""Some analysts are skeptical that the company has enough capital to weather the rest of the ***recession**, though there are signs that it is climbing back from the brink after suffering massive losses through its relationship with Franklin Credit Management Corp., a subprime lender.Huntington lost $125.1 million in the second quarter, down substantially from a net loss of $2.43 billion in the prior quarter that was largely due to a $2.6 billion impairment charge.The company also showed promising earnings potential, with its pretax, preprovision earnings rising about 2%, to $212 million in the second quarter. Analysts and investors viewed that modest increase favorably, given the depth of the downturn.Still, Andrew Marquardt, a banking analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller LLC, said Huntington remains undercapitalized compared with its peers.Also, its earnings remain under pressure and troubled loans continue to mount.Loss provisions rose a surprising 42% in the second quarter, to $413.7 million.""The bottom line is that [this action] is basically catching up on the fact that their last capital raise was short by $90 million,"" he said. ""But on the other hand, it doesn't necessarily put the capital situation at complete rest, in my view.""Marquardt said the company has ""below average"" earnings power and that its tangible common equity level will still be about ""100 basis points below the average Midwest"" bank, should it issue the full $150 million in common stock.That would put its tangible common equity ratio at about 5.96%, up from 5.68%, Marquardt said.KeyCorp, another large Ohio banking company but based in Cleveland, had a tangible common equity ratio of 7.35% at June 30, according to regulatory filings.Terry McEvoy, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., said it is not clear whether Huntington's capital will be sufficient during the next two quarters, especially when one considers that as many as one-third of publicly traded regional banking companies are expected to remain unprofitable through yearend.""On paper, yes, they do have pro forma capital ratios below their larger Ohio competitors,"" he said. ""I think we're still in an environment where more is better, more capital is better.""Some in the market feel they will need to raise more on the assumption that the losses will be greater than the consensus view.""",1,,,
203,4SX2-P6F0-TW8F-G077-00000-00.txt,"The nation's employers eliminated tens of thousands of jobs in June for the sixth consecutive month in a steady chipping away of the work force that seems likely to leave the economy very weak through Election Day.  Responding quickly to the government employment report, issued Thursday, the presidential candidates called for action, beyond the recent stimulus package, to reverse the deterioration. In past downturns, the Federal Reserve saved the day, or tried to, by cutting interest rates. This time, however, with the Fed having already cut rates drastically, appeals  are increasingly going to the White House and Congress.  ''The numbers are telling us that there is an ongoing deterioration in the labor market at a relatively rapid clip,'' said Jan Hatzius, chief domestic economist at Goldman Sachs. ''It is a sign that the fiscal stimulus, the tax rebates, are failing to lift the broader economy.''  Apart from the 62,000 jobs eliminated in June -- and 438,000 since January -- most workers lost ground to inflation last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. While the average weekly wage of most ordinary workers was up 2.8 percent in the 12 months through June, the Consumer Price Index was up more than 4 percent.  ''Workers just don't have the bargaining power to fend off this erosion,'' said Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.  The erosion of purchasing power, in turn, helps to explain the dismally low consumer confidence numbers in recent weeks. The housing market continues to sag, with little hope of improvement soon.   Adding to the gloom, stock prices plunged this week, pushing a crucial market gauge officially into bear territory, or 20 percent off its peak. And the unemployment rate, which had jumped half a percentage point in May, stayed at 5.5 percent in June, dashing hopes that a horde of young people hunting for jobs would find them and unemployment would fall back.  Few teenagers and new college graduates found work, the bureau reported. What's more, the percentage of unemployed adult workers, 25 and over, ticked up for the second straight month, and various forecasters said that by Election Day, the unemployment rate would probably be 6 percent or more -- a level last seen in the early 1990s, in the aftermath of a ***recession**.  During the last 50 years, each time the economy has lost jobs for six straight months, a ***recession** was ultimately declared.  The last two ***recession**s, in 1990-1 and in 2001, started in the very month that employment began to shrink. That might turn out to be the case this time, too, once all the data is finally revised. But with jobs disappearing, the economy managed to expand in the first quarter by a weak 1 percent and probably dodged a contraction in the second quarter as well, in the view of Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist at Global Insight, a forecasting and consulting firm.  ''We have not really had a downturn quite like this one in which we lose jobs month after month but the economy somehow manages to grow,'' Mr. Gault said.   He and Ian Shepherdson, chief domestic economist for High Frequency Economics, see a ***recession** starting in the fall, just in time for the election. By then, the monthly job losses are likely to have accelerated.   As consumers lose buying power because of  weakened wages and high gasoline prices, companies will respond, Mr. Shepherdson said, with bigger  layoffs, like those announced this week by Starbucks and American Airlines.   ''Right now, the economy is not shrinking because of the tax rebates,'' he said, referring to the $107 billion in checks being mailed by the federal government to millions of Americans over three months.   As a supplement, Senator Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic candidate, called on Congress and President Bush to enact ''energy rebates'' to offset the surge in fuel prices, create a fund to help families avoid foreclosure, extend unemployment insurance benefits beyond the present 26 weeks and channel money to states suffering the most in the current downturn.   Senator John McCain, the Republican candidate, asked Congress to help families facing foreclosure and to enact ''a jobs-first economic plan,'' as well as to lower health costs.  Responding to the jobs report, Dana Perino, the White House press spokeswoman, acknowledged that the nation was ''in a period of slow growth,'' which was having ''an impact on employment.'' So far, she said, 105 million rebate checks have gone out, totaling over $86 billion.  The job cuts were greatest in a category called professional and business services, which lost 51,000 jobs, most of them held by temporary workers. Construction, devastated by the collapse in home prices, was next on the list.   For the 12th straight month, employment in that sector shrank, this time by 43,000 workers. Manufacturing, in constant decline, lost 33,000 jobs in June. And there were job losses in a number of other areas, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.  Indeed, the only notable increases in the private sector were in health care, restaurant work and other food services, and in each of these areas the rise was at only half the pace of a year ago, the Bureau said.  Donald Davis, a 35-year-old truck driver in Birmingham, Ala., certainly feels the pain. He was laid off on Easter  as a driver for a concrete company, and has regularly thumbed through postings at a job placement center ever since, without luck. ''Everything is at a standstill,'' Mr. Davis said. ''Nobody wants to hire anybody right now.''   State and local governments, on the other hand, continued to hire, adding 29,000 jobs last month, and more than 100,000 over the last six months. But most of these governments were operating on budgets enacted for the fiscal year that ended last Monday. The new budgets are expected to contain sharp cost cuts and payroll reductions as the states and municipalities adjust to shrinking tax revenues because of the housing crisis and the weak economy.  ''My guess,''  said Mr. Hatzius of Goldman Sachs, ''is that the job declines across the economy are greater than the monthly numbers we are now seeing, and that will be evident when revisions are published later this year.''

204,7XWF-V3K0-Y9XD-J02Y-00000-00.txt," The losing gubernatorial campaign of Democrat R. Creigh Deeds ended up in the black, but just barely, a campaign report filed yesterday with the State Board of Elections shows. In the closing weeks, as victory appeared more likely for Republican Bob McDonnell, his campaign took in 2 1/2 times more money than did the Deeds campaign. It also outspent Deeds' campaign more than two-to-one in this period. As of Nov. 26, McDonnell had almost $600,000 in cash on hand, while Deeds had $91,950. A spokesman for McDonnell said the money will go to McDonnell's newly set up political action committee, Opportunity Virginia, and to pay transition expenses. McDonnell has set up a transition office in the Ninth Street Office Building to plan for his administration and to hire about 250 staff members. All the transition personnel are being paid out of the surplus funds, communications director Tucker Martin said. The reports cover the period between Oct. 22 and Nov. 26. The election was Nov. 3. A final report must be filed in early January. McDonnell raised $2.5 million in the period, while Deeds raised $899,201. McDonnell spent $3.7 million to Deeds' $1.7 million. David Poole of the Virginia Public Access Project said Deeds and McDonnell combined to spend $40.5 million in the four-year election cycle. This was down from the $45.2 million spent by Democrat Timothy M. Kaine and Republican Jerry W. Kilgore in the 2002-2005 election cycle. Poole said this might be a reflection of the ***recession**. McDonnell spent $23.3 million in winning the election, while Deeds spent $17 million. But all told, including the Democratic nominating primary, $53 million was spent in the 2006-2009 cycle compared with $46.7 million four years ago. Money did not always talk, the reports show. In the race for attorney general, the losing Democrat, Stephen C. Shannon, spent $1.3 million, while Republican Ken Cuccinelli spent $403,327. In the race for lieutenant governor, Republican Bill Bolling, who won, spent $862,073 to Democrat Jody W. Wagner's $693,649. The reports show that McDonnell and Deeds got the bulk of their money from in-state contributors. The largest sectors to donate to each candidate were political committees. Deeds received the second most money from labor unions, while labor unions gave no money to McDonnell. McDonnell drew the second largest amount from the real estate and construction industry. In the final 12 days, from Oct. 23 to Election Day, McDonnell received $1.3 million from 1,237 donors while Deeds received $529,000 from 594 contributors. McDonnell will be inaugurated as governor Jan. 16.Contact Tyler Whitley at (804) 649-6780 or twhitley@timesdispatch.com",0,,,
205,7VJM-TWH0-Y8T5-Y423-00000-00.txt,"c(""The McLean-based news site Mixx.com is hoping to persuade  consumer product developers to draw on the wisdom of the Web as it launches a service today  that pairs its online community of news junkies with companies wanting to bounce ideas off a test audience.The site's new service, called \""Sifter,\"" aims to help consumer-oriented businesses and marketers fine-tune their upcoming products and pitches by putting them in front of a group that already spends much of its time voting things up or down. Basically, it's an online version of focus-group testing.Currently, Mixx readers submit stories and vote on the ones they find most interesting. Now a few thousand of Mixx's most active users, those who have spent hundreds of hours on  the site, also will have access to the new Sifter section. Chris McGill, Mixx's founder, thinks the feature will catch on with such a crowd because these are people who passionately enjoy figuring out what's cool and what's not.\""Our users, and our power users in particular, are by nature 'vetters,' \"" he said. \""It is simply what they do and how the Mixx system works.\""In a world where NASA conducts online contest polls over what to name a space module, turning to the wisdom or enthusiasm of the crowd is becoming a familiar concept.   Last week, for example, Googleopened up the online doors to its research and development department, called GoogleLabs. The plan is that users will get a chance to check out new Googleprojects while they're still in the works.For Mixx, such a move could allow the company to set it apart from better-known \""news aggregation\"" sites such as  Digg and Reddit.Digg, the closest thing to a household name in this category, gets 35 million visitors in the average month. Mixx, by comparison, saw 8.1 million visitors in March, but that's up from 338,000 visitors during the same month a year ago. But even the biggest players in this market aren't profitable yet, including Digg.Launched in 2007, Mixx strives to make its users' pages highly customizable. If you're passionate about the topics of single malt scotch, science fiction TV shows and ballroom dancing, for example, you could conceivably set up your page so that you only see news about those topics.Mixx was created with the idea that advertisers would be able to market themselves effectively on a site where people have already identified their interests. But the ***recession** has hit online advertising as hard as just about every other industry; Yahoo, for example, announced last week that its first-quarter earnings were down 13 percent from the same period in 2008. Mixx is hoping to make between $4,000 and $8,000 per week from clients who using the Sifter service.Mixx's first customer is the Washington-based software developer LivingSocial, the firm behind some of the most popular applications on Facebook. If you've ever sent somebody a virtual beer via Facebook, you've likely used LivingSocial's software. The company's latest hit application, launched last month and already taking Facebook by storm, is \""Pick Your Five\"" in which users choose their favorite five albums, books, celebrity crushes or whatever  to share with their friends.Co-founder Tim O'Shaughnessy said his company will use Sifter to help figure out what his company should do next.\""We have some ideas for what the next step for 'Pick Your Five' is, and that's what we want to test with these people,\"" he said. \""We should be able to get a very, very fast thumbs up or thumbs down this way. The thing that's nice is, it's cheaper, faster and easier than focus groups.\""Clorox is an upcoming client of the new Mixx service. The company will be trying out new packaging for one of its cleaning products; the company's hope is to come up with something attractive enough that consumers will want to keep it on top of the kitchen counter, rather than hidden  under the sink.But not everybody sees Sifter as a no-brainer hit for companies wanting to reach mainstream consumers. Sites such as  Reddit and Digg typically have a distinct character, voice and outlook, said Sam Huxley, director of social marketing and digital public relations at  Arlington-based New Media Strategies. The fascinations that characterize Digg users -- such as last year's dark horse presidential candidate Ron Paul or Web sites containing silly pictures of cats -- might not resonate with mainstream consumers, he said.\""You're testing against a narrow demographic,\"" he said. \""The type of content that plays well on a user-driven site isn't necessarily the type of content that's going to sell.\"""",

206,7W0C-4TR0-Y9KG-D1Y3-00000-00.txt,"WASHINGTON --- In launching his massive economic recovery program, President Barack Obama focused much of the attention on renewable energy jobs, high-speed rail systems and other high-profile projects.But in Georgia, at least, the next phase of the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is dominated by bread-and-butter projects such as regularly scheduled road repavings, mundane maintenance of government buildings and renovations at Army barracks and community health centers, according to a review of the White House's ""Roadmap to Recovery"" that lays out spending priorities for the next 100 days.The plan, released by the White House last week, includes many projects that have been in the works for years but were recently moved up by state and federal officials to fit into the new 100-day playbook. A sampling:Among the 119 Defense Department projects planned for Georgia between now and Sept. 4 are roof repairs and air-conditioning upgrades at the Army National Guard center in Atlanta; barracks renovations at Fort Benning and the replacement of window sills at a Fort Stewart training center.Indicative of the 86 Transportation Department projects is a $3.2 million resurfacing of Ga. 140 from I-575 to the Fulton County line in greater Atlanta.The nearly $12 million that the Department of Health and Human Services plans to pump into Georgia community health centers will go toward paying extra staff salaries to keep clinics open longer or expand them to areas that lack clinics.The Department of Veterans Affairs is getting nearly $35 million to renovate its Georgia facilities.""There will probably be an increase in the amount of activity seen over the next 100 days because money for many projects is just starting to come in,"" said Chris Schrimpf, a spokesman for Gov. Sonny Perdue.Like many of the projects included in the White House's ""roadmap,"" the VA projects in Georgia were already part of the agency's plans for the next 10 years but were moved up to meet the president's goal of accelerating the economic recovery.The projects probably would have been funded ""eventually,"" said Mark Anderson, deputy director for the VA region that includes Georgia, ""but it's good to get it now.""The same can be said for projects at five Georgia airports. Had officials at the state Department of Transportation not applied for $8.2 million in federal stimulus money now, they could have waited until 2012 before the projects got funded, Georgia DOT spokesman David Spear said.To be sure, nobody is saying the projects slated for Georgia and elsewhere in the next 100 days aren't necessary.But the fact that the next phase of the White House's recovery plans are laden with regular maintenance programs or projects that were sped up just to fit into the 100-day goal is giving fuel to some of Obama's critics.Obama has said the projects slated for the next 100 days will create more than 600,000 jobs, yet the White House acknowledges the estimate is based on economic models and is a best guess, not a firm figure.Critics say the jobs would have been created anyway because the projects were going to be done eventually.U.S. Rep. Tom Price, a Republican from Roswell, attacked the Democratic leadership for manufacturing spin about ""saving phantom jobs.""""To fabricate jobs and attribute them to this nonstimulus spending bill is disingenuous and doesn't help the debate at all,"" he said.House Republican Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia accused the Obama administration of seeming ""dramatically out of touch"" as it touts new jobs tied to the recovery act amid still-rising unemployment rates.In Georgia, government officials say it's a little too early to tell how many jobs are going to be created in the upcoming months. And for some projects the state notes the number of workers working on a project, but it does not make the determination whether those jobs were saved or created, said Schrimpf, the Perdue spokesman.Officials know they have to keep track and have a litany of paperwork to prove it.""The guidance we are getting is that we can only report on the actual jobs,"" said Molly Perry, executive director of the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, which is getting stimulus money for three grant programs, allowing it to hire more people.To counter some of the criticism, the White House hit the road to publicize its economic recovery ramp-up.Vice President Joe Biden, whom Obama placed in charge of implementing the stimulus program, kicked off a ""Road to Recovery"" tour this month with visits to projects funded through the recovery act.As to criticism that many of the new 100-day projects were in the works anyway, Jared Bernstein, a Biden economic adviser, said that shouldn't matter.""The question is not, 'Did they plan to do it anyway?' but 'Would they have been able to do it anyway?' "" he said. ""States, including Georgia, are facing very large fiscal constraints because of the ***recession**.""Without the recovery act, many of the projects slated for the next 100 days in Georgia would have been canceled because of a lack of state funds, Bernstein said.Raymond Buday Jr., executive director of the Marietta Housing Authority, boils it down this way: The $1.93 billion available in a Neighborhood Stabilization grant can lead to 193 projects at $10 million a pop. Buday said the housing authority plans to apply for $13 million to $15 million of that money to buy foreclosed property on Franklin Road in Cobb County. His plan: hire people to clear the property, sell it to a developer and use that money to develop mixed-income housing elsewhere. ""That's the vision,"" Buday said.",1,,,

Lunch will be served at both clubs. Members who were previously allowed access only to one club without paying an additional fee will now have access to both. And children will eat free all summer.The two clubs have a long history in downtown Raleigh, catering to politicians and executives. Located a few blocks apart atop two of the Triangle's tallest buildings, the swanky clubs offer expansive views of Raleigh.But the slowing economy and corporate cutbacks have caused membership to decline from 3,500 to roughly 3,000 over the past two years, said Karl Swink, general manager for both clubs. They are owned by Dallas-based Club Corp.\""The club business isn't ***recession**-proof by any means,\"" he said. \""We have the same struggles as the symphony or any other business.\""Swink said the new changes should add more value for members, who previously had to pick one \""home club\"" and pay extra for access to others.The changes also reflect trends in the behavior of members. They tend to eat more breakfasts at the Cardinal Club on the top floor of the Wachovia Capitol Center, because it is close to many downtown offices, Swink said. And they had more dinners at the Capital City Club at the top of the Progress Energy building, because it is closer to entertainment venues.\""It's really looking at how can we make the club more valuable,\"" he said. \""We've been operating two clubs that are four blocks apart, and we duplicated some offerings.\""For existing members there will be no change in dues, which stand at $99 a month, plus $22 to join the Triangle Society -- a membership that gains them access to more than 20 area clubs and golf courses. Anyone signing up after June 1 will pay $111 a month plus $10 if they want to join the Triangle Society.The clubs also are touting more value items, including a $10 lunch, a $30 three-course dinner and the free meals for children this summer.The changes echo those of other downtown dining establishments, which have struggled as the ***recession** deepened.In January, The Mint added a three-course dinner option for $30, well below its average dinner ticket of $60.Others, such as Jibarra, have been touting cheaper lunches.\""Everybody in the business community, every conversation I'm in, people are talking about what they're doing to cut costs,\"" said Sheila Ogle, chairwoman of the board of governors for the Capital City Club. \""But when we come out of this I think everybody will be better companies.\""For some members, the new options are a good thing.Paige Zinn lives in Chapel Hill but often does business in Raleigh for her job as chief operating officer of Jennings Advertising in Chapel Hill. She joined the Capital City Club two weeks ago and was pleased to learn that she would also be entitled to visit the Cardinal Club.\""I figure two is better than one,\"" she said. \""I've only been there three or four times in the past couple of weeks. But I do plan on using it a lot more. Everything really from my perspective is a bonus.\""Swink said he did not know whether there would be changes regarding member benefits at the two clubs, but he did say there are plans for a marketing push in the fall.\""I'd like to say this is indefinite,\"" he said. \""We never know what's going to happen.\""sue.stock@newsobserver.com or 919-829-4649To see more of The News &amp; Observer, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.newsobserver.com.

An example of this might be Kohl's Corp., which recently opened a series of new stores in California, including one in Lodi, all former Mervyns locations.Even a startup business might find support, O'Neal said, but lenders would look for strong managerial experience, a niche situation promising solid and quick returns, and a significant contribution of self-funding.\""If you really can identify a good opportunity, this is the best time to get into business,\"" he said.The Downtown Stockton Business Summit drew several dozen people Monday to the WorkNet offices at 56 S. Lincoln St., officials said.Dennis Smallie, executive director of the Downtown Stockton Alliance, which was the lead event sponsor, was pleased with the turnout.\""I'm encouraged; very encouraged,\"" he said.The alliance, as well as the SBA, WorkNet and other sponsors such as the San Joaquin Angels, San Joaquin County Enterprise Zone and Small Business Development Center at San Joaquin Delta College, offer a wide variety of programs to help area businesses.Those include educational seminars and workshops, consultation, design and marketing expertise, and loan programs, and much of it is free.Events such as Monday's summit help get the word out.\""People just need to know how to get a little help,\"" Smallie said.Contact reporter Reed Fujii at (209) 546-8253 or rfujii@recordnet.comTo see more of The Record, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.recordnet.com.

209,4SYS-73G0-TXCG-81P4-00000-00.txt,"c(""COVER STORY"", ""Olivier Hecht is a corporate dropout. Just three months after getting laid off from Circuit City in June 2007, he purchased a Handyman Matters home-improvement franchise and struck out on his own. He hasn't looked back. Nor have Betsy and Beau Dabney. They both worked at Capital One Financial Corp.Beau wanted to get out of the corporate world - \""it was not a good fit,\"" he said. The Dabneys bought a Virginia Barbecue franchise and opened it in 2006 in the Lakeside area of Henrico County. Hecht, who lives in Richmond, and the Dabneys of Ashland are part of what franchise experts say is an unprecedented growth spurt in the industry over the past decade. From 2001 to 2005, the number of franchised establishments jumped 4.3 percent annually and jobs in those businesses grew 3 percent annually, according to the International Franchise Association in Washington. The ***economic downturn** may hurt some franchise operations, experts say. Financing is tough in the wake of the credit crunch, and starting a franchise requires capital plus hard work and a willingness to play by the rules. But franchising is thriving, and the industry as a whole will continue to grow, said Matthew Shay, president and chief executive officer of the trade association. Across the nation, 909,253 franchise businesses employed more than 11 million workers and generated $881 billion worth of goods and services in 2005, according to the most recent figures by the association. In Virginia, about 26,000 franchise businesses provided 336,901 jobs, paid employees $8.6 million and produced goods and services worth $27 million in 2005. A total of 49 franchise systems are based in Virginia, according to Frandata, a franchise information services organization in Arlington County. Darrell Johnson, president and CEO of Frandata, said the big industry story is a flurry of new concepts and diversificationJohnson within franchise sectors. Gold's Gym and Bally Total Fitness, for example, are household names in the franchise industry's fitness sector. During the past few years, that segment has specialized and expanded. There's Nifty After Fifty now, a California exercise studio for older adults, launched in 2006, and Anytime Fitness of Minnesota, a co-ed facility that caters to people who want to exercise in the wee hours, or anytime, in a safe environment. That franchise, which started in 2002, operates 24/7, every day of the year. LOOKUP The challenges Economic uncertainties have made it harder to get into a franchise, Johnson said. Banks have tightened lending requirements in the past 12 months, making it tough for prospective franchisees to access capital. It may be easier to get financing through franchises listed on the U.S. Small Business Administration's registry at www.franchiseregistry.com, Johnson said. Franchises on the list have been scrutinized and meet lender criteria for qualified borrowers. Total initial investment can range from $20,000 for the smallest franchise venture - say, a kiosk - to $6.5 million for a hotel franchise. Franchise owners also pay royalties, an average 6.7 percent of gross revenue, according to the International Franchise Association. Franchisees get an operating manual and training and support, including marketing and advertising guidance. In return, they pay recurring fees and royalties, and they must follow the sometimes restrictive rules and often-changing methods of the franchiser. Operating a franchise is not for everyone, and owning one is not a guaranteed path to quick riches and early retirement, said franchise attorney Eric Perkins of Hirschler Fleischer PC in Richmond. A primary cause of franchisee failure - like that in any new business - relates to cash-flow problems. \""Franchisers are required to provide estimates of startup expenses and required capital, but they are not required to provide revenue estimates,\"" Perkins said. \""Given the risk involved, very few franchisers offer any indication as to how much revenue you should expect to generate as a franchisee. Conservative budgeting and adequate financing are essential to the long-term success of a new franchisee.\""The costsBeau Dabney of Virginia Barbecue warned of unexpected expenses. Construction costs are \""always double the cost and then some,\"" he said. Also, skyrocketing fuel prices have hit the restaurant with higher and unexpected charges for food delivery and Dumpster and linen services. Still, these entrepreneurs say they are pleased with the decision to buy a franchise. \""To me, it's the perfect combination of having an independently owned and operated office - but with support,\"" said Hecht, who owns two Handyman Matters territories, one in the Richmond area and the other in Northern Virginia. \""I've been barbecuing for almost 10 years,\"" said Dabney, who purchased the first franchise from Rick Ivey, founder of the Fredericksburg-based Virginia Barbeque restaurant system. \""Barbecue is going to be the next cheeseburger,\"" he said. A typical Virginia Barbecue will cost between $36,000 and $202,000 to open, depending on the size of the restaurant, the company said on its Web site. The monthly royalty fee is 6 percent of net sales. A Rainbow Station children's learning franchise costs about $5 million initially, founder Gail Johnson said. That includes land, site work and constructing two buildings. Johnson owns three Rainbow Stations in Richmond and Mechanicsville. About nine are open or under construction in Virginia, North Carolina and Texas, according to the Rainbow Station Web site.The advantagesFranchisees buy into a business model that is up and running. They say they prefer these assurances over the uncertainties and tedious process of starting from scratch. Unlike big corporations, they are small and tend to be nimble, said Hecht of Handyman Matters. But if franchisees make a wrong decision, the consequences are swift and sometimes severe. \""You don't have a cushion if you make a wrong decision,\"" as one might in the corporate world, he said. Rainbow Station's Johnson said starting a franchise involves hard work, delayed gratification and is expensive. \""Sometimes you feel like you've hit a brick wall,\"" she said. \""But someone said that brick walls are there for you to know how much you want something. They also keep people that are less motivated out. \""If you're going to invest in a business, you need to have fire in the belly to get through the long days and nights as you start your business.\""* * *Here are tips if you are considering a franchiseThinking of buying a franchise? Follow these tips from Tim O'Brien, chief examiner at the State Corporation Commission's Division of Securities and Retail Franchising in Richmond: Carefully study the franchise disclosure document. The document contains information to make an informed decision about buying a franchise. The document provides a look at the management and operations of the franchiser, the financial shape and size and how much money is needed upfront, and all the fees and royalties. It discloses bankruptcies and litigation and contains the names and phone numbers of current and former franchisees, and how many have left the system. Interview current and former franchisees. Contact some and ask about their experience in that franchise system. Analyze the franchise territory offered. Can you be successful there? Will the franchiser cannibalize your sales by selling to your prospective customers on the Internet or through direct marketing? Seek professional advice and counsel. Let a franchise lawyer, a certified public accountant and an independent business adviser review the disclosure document. They can spot red flags, identify areas where you can negotiate and help you understand everything that you must sign.* * *Franchisees sometimes sue franchisers for the following reasons, according to franchise attorney Eric Perkins of Hirschler Fleisher PC in Richmond: failing to comply with the franchise registration or disclosure requirements, wrongfully terminating the franchise agreement, encroaching on the franchisee's business or breaching the contract. Some tips: Pay close attention to the termination provision. They tend to favor the franchiser. You don't want to wind up in court fighting a wrongful termination. Beware of no-compete covenants. If you part ways with the franchiser, you don't want to be hamstrung if you decide to operate a similar business. Be aware that renewal agreements may change. When your franchise agreement is about to expire, the franchiser likely will make changes in the new agreement. You will be expected to sign it if you wish to continue as a franchisee.* * *Top 10 Virginia-based franchises by number of unitsThe largest franchises by the number of units and their locations are as follows:JTH Tax Inc.

210,4TKP-7NC0-TX12-N0D2-00000-00.txt,"c(""Oct. 3--WASHINGTON--Two North Carolina House Republicans reversed course Friday and voted to support the revised $700 billion bailout bill, helping to send President Bush the biggest federal rescue of the private sector in history.Reps. Howard Coble, R-6th, and Sue Myrick, R-9th, joined 54 other House members who had voted no on a bailout bill Monday. The revised version passed the House Friday 263 to 171.Coble's change of heart came after a flood of constituent calls and what he described as light pressure from Republican leaders, including the president.Myrick said she could lose her re-election over the vote. She cited meetings with North Carolina business owners as the reason she changed course.A White House aide called Coble's chief of staff Thursday, Coble said.\""They said, 'Does Howard want the president to call him?' 'No' was my answer,\"" Coble said. \""I wanted this decision to be mine and mine alone.\""House Republican Leader John Boehner and Roy Blunt, the Republican whip, also called Coble Thursday. Coble said that when he told them he was leaning toward supporting the bill, \""they got off my back.\""The constituent calls had the most impact, he said. His calls were running heavily against the bill, but he said that after the House rejected the bailout Monday, opinions began to even out.\""I stand to annoy about 50 percent of my constituents,\"" Coble said in an interview after the vote.Coble had tried earlier in the week to push back on the urgent way the bill was presented, saying \""the sky is not falling.\""\""If the sky does fall, it's going to land on my head,\"" he said Friday.He cited an increase on government insurance limits to $250,000 for savings accounts as one key reason he changed his mind about the bill.Her constituent calls were running about even on the issue, Myrick said, but business owners large and small convinced her the economic meltdown was affecting their bottom lines.\""I was told the credit crunch or crisis is real,\"" she said. \""I wasn't going to take the chance of going into a Depression.\""Myrick and Coble aside, the rest of the North Carolina delegation maintained the same positions on the bill that they took Monday. The four other North Carolina Republicans voted against the measure. Four North Carolina Democrats voted for it, and three voted against.Besides the insurance limits, the Senate version included more than $8 billion dollars in tax provisions, which bill supporters said amounted to a \""mixed blessing\"" in their quest to find at least 12 more votes for the bill than they had Monday.Rep. Mel Watt, D-12th, supported the bill from the start, but he expressed dismay that the Senate added the tax measures without completely paying for them.\""The Senate's failure to pay for the cost of these (tax) measures concerns me. But we have no choice but to try to address the credit and ***economic crisis**,\"" Watt said in a statement.Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-5th, said she was more upset about how Democrats, who control the House, limited debate on the final bill. A House rule, voted on by members Friday morning, barred any amendments to the economic rescue package.Foxx and three other House members had requested in a letter Wednesday to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Boehner that the bill be amended to have more oversight, including an FBI investigation into how Wall Street landed in this crisis.\""It's perhaps the most important bill in recent memory -- aside from the war -- and we were shut out,\"" Foxx said.(E-mail nsimon@mediageneral.com or call 202-662-7669.)For more information about Media General's Washington Bureau, go to www.mgwashington.com.

211,4SHD-WDH0-TWHW-616B-00000-00.txt,"   WASHINGTON -- Lewis Carroll, call your office. Or, better still, the author of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" should call Washington, where the government's determination to solve the housing ""crisis"" produced this lead paragraph in a recent New York Times story: ""Federal agencies are intensifying a criminal investigation of the mortgage industry and focusing on whether some lenders turned a blind eye to inflated income figures provided by borrowers.""Perhaps some lenders who were lied to were culpably indifferent to dishonesty because they planned to sell to others mortgages that the lenders knew were risky. But the victimization narrative that is turning turbulence in the housing market into a morality tale involves borrowers victimized by ""predatory"" lenders. The narrative remains murky because there is scant information about the percentage of currently distressed borrowers who were untruthful about their incomes or net worth when talking to lenders.One symptom of the ""crisis"" is that housing prices have fallen. How far is unclear. Estimates range from 3 percent to 13 percent. Questions arise.Do young couples struggling to purchase their first homes concur with the sudden consensus that the decline in prices is a national misfortune? The Economist reports: ""Monthly payments on a typical house with a 30-year mortgage and 20 percent down payment were 18.5 percent of the median family's income in February, down from almost 26 percent at the peak -- and close to the historical average."" By this measure of housing affordability, the ""crisis"" is welcome.The housing perhaps-not-altogether-a-crisis resembles, in one particular, the curious consensus about the global warming ""crisis,"" concerning which, the assumption is: Although Earth's temperature has risen and fallen through many millennia, the temperature was exactly right when, in the 1960s, Al Gore became interested in the subject. Are we to assume that last year, when housing prices were, say, 10 percent higher than they are now, they were exactly right? If so, why is that so? Because the market had set those prices, therefore they were where they belonged? But if the market was the proper arbiter of value then, why is it not the proper arbiter now? Whatever happened to the belief, way back in 2007, that there was a housing ""bubble""? Or to the more ancient consensus that, because of, among other things, the deductibility of mortgage interest payments from taxable income, too much American capital flows into the housing stock?Homeownership is, up to a point, a barometer of social health: Ownership deepens an individual's sense of having a stake in the health of the neighborhood and the larger community. Today, 67.8 percent of households own their homes, up from 65.9 percent 10 years ago and 63.7 percent 15 years ago. There are, however, limits to how high the rate can rise: Not everyone wants or can afford to own. And there are prudential limits to how high government should drive ownership by, for example, pressuring lenders to satisfy borrowers who have questionable qualifications.As housing legislation perhaps heads for a rendezvous with the president's veto pen, remember that the object of the policymaking exercise is not justice -- or compassion, which is not the same thing -- for this or that category of lenders or borrowers. Rather, the main point of the exercise is to mitigate bad consequences for two categories of innocent bystanders.One category consists of those who live in proximity to foreclosed homes. Unoccupied houses become subject to decay and vandalism, thereby letting loose the infectious disease of blight that depresses the values of properties in concentric circles.The other category consists of everybody. Seventy percent of economic activity is personal consumption, which recently has been fueled by the ""wealth effect"" -- people spending because they feel wealthier due to the appreciation of their largest asset, their house. So ""stabilizing"" -- i.e., putting an artificial floor under -- housing prices may be necessary to fuel consumption by a public that in the 1980s saved almost 10 cents of every dollar it earned, and in the 1990s saved a nickel, but recently has had a negative savings rate. This will, however, injure some innocent people, such as those young couples waiting to become homeowners. And it will benefit others who have earned an injury, such as speculators and others who bet that the prices of houses would never decline.Everyone knows that there is only one commodity the price of which always rises -- major league pitchers. Concerning the market for them, Congress should do something. George Will's e-mail address is georgewill@washpost.com",1,,,

213,7XV2-FFB0-Y9KV-62JB-00000-00.txt,"Taiwan formally replaced most of its Cabinet Thursday in a bid to appease public anger over its response to last month's deadly Typhoon Morakot. The mass resignations followed Premier Liu Chao-shiuan's surprise announcement Monday that he would quit. On Thursday, the defense, economics, and foreign ministers and other officials stepped down and their replacements were sworn in. Analysts say the new lineup is unlikely to change the China-friendly President Ma Ying-jeou's cross-strait or economic policies. Rather, the shakeup was damage control by a president who's seen his approval ratings plummet. ""In order to save the king, you have to give up some generals,"" said Shih Cheng-feng, a political analyst at National Dong Hwa University. ""I don't see much fundamental policy change."" The reshuffle comes after weeks of scathing criticism that the government had a slow and disorganized response to flooding and landslides in the wake of typhoon Morakot. Some 700 people died, many buried alive under avalanches of mud that were triggered by torrential rains. President Ma put Premier Liu in charge of the disaster response, keeping a low profile in the days immediately following the storm. Ma has been widely condemned, even by some in his own party, for failing to declare a state of emergency, not fully mobilizing the military and showing poor leadership. The outcry reached critical mass a few days after the storm, creating the biggest political crisis to date for Ma's presidency. Image booster or smooth talker? The new cabinet will be headed by Wu Den-yih, a former mayor of Taiwan's southern port city Kaohsiung, and vice-premier Eric Chu, considered a young, rising star in the ruling Kuomintang. Analysts say Mr. Wu was tapped to restore the government's public image with his communication skills - an area where the old Cabinet got especially poor marks. But some southern Taiwanese also call him ""white thief"" a derogatory phrase implying he's an untrustworthy smooth-talker. The more popular Mr. Chu, the new vice-premier, is being groomed as a possible successor to Ma as the KMT's next presidential candidate. ""He wants to keep a low profile for now, but that [a presidential run] is quite possible in the future,"" says Liao Da-chi, a political analyst at National Sun Yat-sen University. The US-educated Chu is known for pushing an airport free-trade zone during his seven-year stint as a county commissioner. He's seen as an expert on finance and accounting. Top focus is still good ties with China Both men are expected to continue to push Ma's business- and investor-friendly policies, which include the centerpiece agenda of calming relations with rival China. China sees Taiwan as part of its territory, to be retaken by force if need be. Ma's predecessors riled Beijing by trumpeting the self-ruled island's independence. But Ma has sought to avoid irking China and has pushed a raft of commercial agreements to bind the island's economy closer to China's. So far, his government has inked deals on tourism, direct flights, and investments with Beijing. Specific agreements on banking, markets, and insurance are expected by the end of the year. Ma is also pushing for a broader free-trade deal with China, known as an ""Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement."" Observers say Ma was also frustrated with his economics team's handling of that deal, and seized the current political crisis as an opportunity to oust them. The former economics minister came under fire for failing to push the cross-strait trade deal more quickly, confusing the public and then publishing an explanatory cartoon brochure that critics say stereotyped southern Taiwanese as ignorant bumpkins. ""The communication for ECFA wasn't going well, and then they had the problem with the cartoon,"" says Liao. Investors reacted positively to the new cabinet, sending the island's main stock index up 1.1 percent to a 13-month high.",0,,,

Getting the nation's most talented labor force back to work is everyone's job.Wall Street's loss could be city schoolkids' gain.The economic meltdown is driving some of the best and brightest to consider something they might never have when the stock market was booming and bonuses were fat: teaching.After years of math and finance courses, Alberto Cruz, 23, felt destined to join the ranks of Wall Street's high rollers, landing a job as a financial planner at Northwestern Mutual after graduating from Fordham University in 2007.As tough times in the financial sector turned to turmoil, he started rethinking his career choice.""People were losing their jobs around me, and everybody was so uneasy,"" Cruz said. ""I wanted to not only have stability in my life, but also make a real difference in my community.""This year, instead of helping rich folks manage their millions, he's giving kids lessons in long division at a Bronx middle school through the New York City Teaching Fellows program, which is aimed at career switchers.Applicants to the program have risen about 20% since last year, and 60% more identified themselves as having worked in the financial industry.Applications have also been rising sharply at Teach For America, which places mostly new college graduates in lower-performing schools. This year's class at Columbia University's Teachers College is the largest ever.When there is demand for teachers, there is also often need for teachers' aides, school nurses, custodians and cooks.With corporate America and Wall Street in trouble, many new graduates are opting for service-oriented jobs like teaching, said Trudy Steinfeld, executive director of New York University's career development center.""The changing economic climate has given them the freedom to pursue something that they wanted in their heart of hearts to pursue,"" she said.For the city's schools, it's a windfall.""This is an opportunity to be as selective as possible, to hire people we think are going to be excellent teachers from Day One,"" said Vicky Bernstein, executive director of teacher recruitment at the city's Department of Education.Hefty city and state budget cuts will mean stiffer competition among would-be teachers. The city's schools will likely hire only a few thousand teachers in 2009, down from the 5,500 hired this year, Bernstein said. The number of teaching-fellow slots shrank by 200 this year, and she expects there will be fewer in 2009.City teachers typically start earning $45,000 a year, a modest sum compared to the six-figure salaries attached to some Wall Street jobs. Most are expected to have a master's degree within a few years of starting, if not before.Teaching tends to hold up in tough economic times, said James Parrott, chief economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute. ""It's probably the most stable of any sector.""During the downturn that began in late 2000, when the city shed 6.3% of its jobs, the number of jobs in education rose, he said.Strong enrollment at the city's pricey private schools means there's been no slowdown in demand for teachers there, recruiters said.The economy's troubles also haven't dented demand for a less traditional kind of teacher - test-preparation instructors.""Where people cut back on buying shoes and bags, I don't think they think of cutting back on their kids' education,"" said Joseph Iovino, director of marketing for The Princeton Review's private tutoring program. It charges $140 to $435 an hour to help get students into highly competitive high schools and colleges.For Cruz, the move from finance to teaching has meant a big adjustment. He said his pay is more than a third lower, and his students are generally less well behaved than his former clientele.""At the same time, you can't replace the feeling when you see the light bulb turn on in a kid's head,"" he said.elazarowitz@nydailynews.comCLIP &amp; SAVE GUIDE:CAREERSIN EDUCATIONEducating kids takes more than just teachers.Schools and day care centers need people with a variety of skills to make them run smoothly.In the public schools, there are custodian engineers who are charged with keeping buildings clean and in good repair and managing a janitorial staff.

215,4SVB-W6P0-TW8F-G0K0-00000-00.txt,"IN the age of $5-a-gallon gas, $15 baggage fees on airlines and toxic tomatoes, plenty of people probably feel ready to stick their head out the window and yell, ''I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.''   Madison Avenue understands.  Thirty-two years after the indignant news anchor played by Peter Finch in the movie ''Network'' shouted his way into the Fed-up Hall of Fame, advertisers are trying to capture the spirit of his outrage in campaigns that reflect and capitalize on the angry mood of the American consumer.  The tone and attitude of the ads are part rant, part battle cry, part manifesto and part populist appeal. They emulate how the Finch character, Howard Beale, sounded during an era not unlike today's when, as he put it, ''everyone's out of work or scared of losing their job'' and ''the dollar buys a nickel's worth.''  The Beale voice -- with echoes of comedians like George Carlin  and Denis Leary,  plus a dash of a real-life anchor, Keith Olbermann  of MSNBC -- is being heard in campaigns for numerous advertisers. Here are some examples:  Southwest Airlines is attacking the fees that  rival airlines charge their customers.Harley-Davidson is proclaiming that ''freedom and wind outlast hard times.''  The Versus cable network is rallying fans of the Tour de France bicycle race to ''Take back the Tour.''  Jackson Hewitt is showing taxpayers who did not use its tax-preparation services angrily smashing or throwing things.  Eastman Kodak tells printer owners that ''pricey ink stinks'' and camera owners that it will ''take a stand'' against companies that ''treat people's most precious images as if they were nothing more than file formats.''   Consumers ''are very serious about what's going on,'' said Gary M. Stibel,  chief executive at the New England Consulting Group in Westport, Conn., which recently started a practice devoted to pricing and profit in a ***recession**.  Mr. Stibel said marketers were finding that consumers would pay attention to ''common sense, direct approaches, not ads that are silly or gimmicky.''  He praised the Southwest campaign for tapping into the sentiment of consumers ''without stepping over the line by insulting the loyal customers'' of its competitors. The campaign, by GSD&amp;M Idea City in Austin, Tex., carries the theme ''Fees don't fly with us.''  A chart in a print ad shows how fares are lower on fee-free Southwest than on other airlines. ''What have they been smoking?'' the headline asks, referring to the rivals. ''Apparently, your rolled-up $20s.''  The goal was ''to do something disruptive'' that reflects the frustrations of fliers, said Derek Pletch,  vice president and group creative director at Idea City, part of the Omnicom Group.  The campaign has an edge to it, Mr. Pletch acknowledged, but it also has ''an empathetic tone that tells them, 'We understand what you're going through.' ''  That edge is also seen in a Harley-Davidson campaign, created by Carmichael Lynch in Minneapolis, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. ''We don't do fear,'' asserts a headline on a print ad, which is laid out to resemble the American flag.  ''Over the last 105 years in the saddle, we've seen wars, conflicts, depression, ***recession**, resistance and revolutions,'' the ad begins, referring to the founding of Harley-Davidson in 1903. ''We've watched a thousand hand-wringing pundits disappear in our rearview mirror.''  ''But every time, this country has come out stronger than before,'' the ad goes on, before concluding that the right response to the national mood ought to be, ''Let's ride.''  The genesis of the ad was ''listening to our rider,'' said Scott Beck, director for advertising and promotions at Harley-Davidson in Milwaukee, particularly those who have bought motorcycles recently.  ''Clearly, there's a history of an unconventional attitude that is core to us as a brand,'' he added. ''That's why we felt so strongly about it.''  The response to the campaign has been ''tremendous,'' Mr. Beck said, listing examples like the more than 21,000 comments left on the Harley-Davidson Web site (harley-davidson.com) and the distribution by dealers of bandanas and T-shirts bearing the text of the ad.  The campaign for Versus, a cable network owned by the Comcast Corporation, is intended to draw viewers to the network's coverage of the Tour de France bicycle race, which starts July 5.  The ''Take back the Tour'' campaign, by a New York agency named the Concept Farm, addresses the damage to the race from scandals that involved performance-enhancing drug use by leading cyclists. After dismissing ''the dopers, politics and critics'' because ''they ripped the soul out of this race,'' the ads -- in print, online (takebackthetour.com) and on T-shirts -- declare the tour belongs not to them but to the fans.  The campaign ''makes a blunt statement,'' said Griffin Stenger,  partner and creative director at the Concept Farm, to persuade viewers to ''identify with that attitude of 'Yeah, I feel that, too; I'm sick of all the negativity.' ''  Ray Mendez,  also a partner and creative director at the Concept Farm, said he did not believe the campaign was too angry, especially at a time when ''on some fundamental level everyone's sick of everything, economically, politically.''   That point was echoed by Andrew Brief,  director for client services at DeVito/Verdi in New York, the agency for Jackson Hewitt.  ''When times are bad, people are looking at their tax refunds as their biggest payday of the year,'' Mr. Brief said, ''so they can really relate to that feeling'' of anger displayed in the commercials. They include a musician smashing his guitar and an office worker shattering a glass cabinet.DeVito/Verdi also creates a campaign for the Sports Authority retail chain, owned by an investor group led by Leonard Green &amp; Partners, that aims to reassure shoppers worried about rising prices.  In one commercial, as a golfer loses a ball in the water, an announcer asserts: ''You're a golfer. You've paid enough already,'' then promises that Sports Authority is ''dedicated to the dedicated.''  Some advertisers that seek to address the national mood are delivering pitches in a less intense, more whimsical manner than marketers like Southwest or Harley-Davidson.  For instance, a campaign for Absolut vodka, which carries the theme ''In an Absolut world,'' seems as mad as, well, heck.  Ads by TBWA/Chiat/Day in New York, part of the TBWA Worldwide division of Omnicom,  depict a politician with a Pinocchio nose, a nice apartment in Manhattan that costs $300 a month and a factory with smokestacks that emit bubbles.  ''Absolut is different in that we're about presenting a more idealized world,'' said Tim Murphy,  vice president for marketing at the Absolut Spirits Company in New York, part of the V&amp;S Group division of V&amp;S Vin and Sprit,  the Swedish company that distills Absolut.  ''The brand stands for sociability, celebration,'' he added, so the campaign is ''meant to be a more positive light, not in a way that's confrontational or negative or disparaging anyone else.''  And some marketers are finding they cannot always channel their inner Howard Beales.  Among the ads in the Southwest campaign was one featuring a mock coupon that read, ''Don't #$*!% me over,'' which appeared above a declaration that ''Southwest is the only airline that accepts this coupon.'' That ad, however, was withdrawn.",1,,,

219,7X8F-4F81-2PKR-S0K9-00000-00.txt," WASHINGTON ? Under heavy pressure to get Americans back to work, President Barack Obama on Monday suggested using a suddenly available pot of money left over from the government's bank bailout to help create more jobs. Obama, who will address the subject in a speech Tuesday, has been struggling to trim the nation's painfully high unemployment rate, now at 10 percent, just below a quarter-century high. He said there may be ""selective approaches"" for tapping into the money that was to go for propping up seriously ailing financial institutions. The administration and its allies on Capitol Hill would have to get around a provision of the 2008 bailout legislation that requires money that is paid back by banks or left over to be used exclusively for reducing the federal deficit. With a tough election year coming up, Obama and congressional Democrats want badly to do something about jobs. Turning a highly unpopular financial rescue program, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), into a potentially popular one with new jobs attached has strong political appeal ? although Republican critics have depicted such an approach as a backdoor way of putting a second economic stimulus package into force. The administration now estimates that the TARP will cost about $200 billion less than the $341 billion the White House estimated in August. The lower estimate reflects faster repayments by big banks and less spending on some of the rescue programs as the financial sector recovered from its freefall more quickly than anticipated. ""TARP has turned out to be much cheaper than we had expected, although not cheap,"" Obama told reporters at the White House. ""It means that some of that money can be devoted to deficit reduction. And the question is: Are there selective approaches that are consistent with the original goals of TARP ? for example, making sure that small businesses are still getting lending ? that would be appropriate in accelerating job growth?"" ""And I will be addressing that tomorrow,"" Obama said. It was the clearest signal yet that the White House might be planning to argue that helping unlock credit for small businesses is in line with the original goals of the bank bailout bill and thus a valid expenditure of federal money ? with more job creation a byproduct. The bailout program, which had an initial price tag of $700 billion, was passed by Congress in October 2008 as the nation's financial system teetered on the brink of collapse. It was followed this year by a less narrowly focused $787 billion stimulus package sponsored by Obama and passed by Congress that includes funds for a wide variety of projects. While the TARP bailout was intended to calm markets, it has become for many people a symbol of a supposed government bias for Wall Street at the expense of Main Street. It has contributed to a widespread anti-Washington mood that is troubling to incumbents of both parties. Many of the nation's largest Wall Street institutions have roared back to health with the government's helping hand, even as the rest of the economy continues to suffer and shed jobs. Some congressional Democrats are looking at redirecting up to $70 billion from the bailout windfall for job-related and other purposes. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last week that the House is eying a bill to pay for construction jobs, aid to strapped state and local governments, and help for small business ""to be paid for"" with unallocated bailout funds. She said any jobs bill would be in addition to separate ""safety net"" legislation that would again extend unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless and renew health insurance subsidies for them. Only the safety net measure is likely to make it through Congress this year, senators say. Republicans say using the TARP to pay for any jobs bill is simply a shell game to lend the impression that the action wouldn't add to the deficit. New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg, the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said Monday that the law explicitly blocks using the TARP for infrastructure or other nonfinancial industry projects. ""Everybody agreed that this money ? as it came back in ? was going to go back to reducing the deficit and the debt,"" said Gregg, who was one of the chief negotiators in writing the law. Gregg said that Democrats are eying ""this money as some sort of a kitty, a slush fund to be used by the appropriators around here for the purposes of whatever the next stimulus exercise is going to be."" The White House had initially seemed cool to the notion of trying to redirect TARP money to jobs-related programs. But over the past few days, it has changed its tone. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on Monday denied GOP charges that using leftover bailout funds for spending projects would be tantamount to a second stimulus package in disguise. ""I think Republicans are just simply dead wrong,"" Gibbs said. He said the president and his White House economic team as well as lawmakers on Capitol Hill ""are looking at these questions to see what are the important and necessary next steps."" Obama has been buoyed by recent reports showing the jobless rate declined to 10 percent in November from 10.2 percent in October, and that the economy grew by at a 2.8 percent rate in the July-September period after four quarters of decline. ""What my speech will focus on tomorrow is the fact that, having gotten the ***financial crisis** under control ... our biggest challenge now is making sure that job growth matches up with economic growth,"" Obama said. And he said one of the biggest remaining problems is that small businesses are still having a hard time getting loans. ""They cannot get the loans that they need to make capital investments that would allow them to then expand employment. And that's a particular area where we might be able to make a difference, ""Obama said. The new TARP estimates could reduce the administration's deficit forecast for the current budget year from $1.5 trillion to $1.3 trillion ? assuming that all of the $200 billion windfall went exclusively toward deficit reduction and was all targeted for a single fiscal year. The deficit for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 was a record $1.42 trillion  ",1,,,

Those who aren't particularly compelled to look North often hit on a couple of key themes, namely citing that the domestic market in Canada lacks the size of the U.S., the capital markets aren't as developed and the uncertainty around politics can bring about major changes seemingly overnight. Throw in the fact that the exchange rate for the loonie is nearly flush with the U.S. dollar - impacting exports and removing the traditional discount U.S. buyers used to enjoy - and some may wonder why anyone would even bother with a due diligence trip.Of course, those espousing cross-border M&amp;A between the U.S. and Canada can paint a picture that's as rosy as a detractor's depiction is bleak. And for U.S. deal pros who might already be fatigued by the ""credit crunch,"" a case can certainly be made for looking North. Ironically, it's the same factors that detractors may point to that are providing stability to the Canadian market.""Canada has one tenth of the population of the U.S., and because of that our companies are not as profitable. These are the issues we have to deal with, and that makes us more conservative by nature,"" Doug Robbins, founder of Ontario-based intermediary Robbinex Inc., says. Robbins adds: ""It's this conservatism that in effect has prevented us from falling into the same kind of subprime mortgage problem that is impacting the U.S.... The United States is worried about falling into a ***recession**, but in Canada, we don't have those concerns.""Indeed, while the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a half point in September, in an attempt to provide some relief, the Bank of Canada preceded the Fed move by leaving its target for the overnight rate intact while declaring that it's economy is ""operating further above its production potential"" than it had anticipated in earlier estimates. However, some do anticipate that certain factors will force the BoC to trim rates when it meets again on October 16 and December 4. (see sidebar, page 57)But for that dose of sanguinity, Robbins thanks Canada's ""extreme conservatism.""""Our banks are ultra-conservative,"" he repeats, ""So they haven't got the same kind of problems... Of course, since we're more risk adverse, things tend to move a bit slower.""Canada: Keep exploringTo be sure, things don't move all that slow in Canada. In fact, the country's domestic buyout activity has shot up dramatically in 2007. By mid-year, 96 Canadian buyout transactions were consummated with a total value of $61 billion, according to Canada's Venture Capital Association. Take out the massive, $47.2 billion Bell Canada buyout, and the domestic activity totaled $13.8 billion for the first six months, which surpasses the full-year 2006 total of $11.6 billion last year.Moreover, cross-border dealmaking, driven by both corporate and financial buyers, has been equally robust. As of late September, $34US.5 billion worth of transactions had been inked by U.S. acquirers, up from $28US.6 billion last year and representing a more than threefold gain compared to the $8US.1 billion of cross-border deals cinched in 2003. (see chart, page 56)These gains are partly attributable to the same factors that drove the U.S. M&amp;A boom, as liquidity in the financing markets and private equity has buttressed much of the deal activity. And while the debt markets are expected to remain more buoyant in Canada, there is another factor that should keep dealmakers cheerful - namely, changes in the tax treatment of income trusts in late 2006 essentially created a new pool of acquisition targets. That, in addition to the relative optimism surrounding the Canadian economy, has some U.S. investors taking note.Genstar Capital's Richard Hoskins, a managing director at the U.S. private equity shop, describes that his firm had traditionally been very active in the Canadian market. But when the income trust market was at its peak, companies that might make for ideal acquisition targets instead went public via an income trust. ""It put a huge dent in the ability of private equity funds to pursue deals at what could be considered reasonable valuations,"" he says.Then, in October 2006, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty stripped income trusts of their preferential tax treatment. ""Almost overnight that changed the dynamics of the Canadian market, and that was ultimately the lynchpin for us to reinitiate our efforts in the country."" Hoskins &amp; Co. won't be alone. According to Robbins, in the Canadian deals shopped by his firm, roughly 20% of the bidders he encounters are U.S. entities. To him, that number is low. Robbins is anticipating that as U.S. buyers cope with the credit crunch in their home markets, and at the same time become educated about the Canadian market, they will become more inclined to pursue deals North of the border. ""A lot of foreigners still have forty different questions about buying in Canada,"" Robbins says. ""And yeah, the rules are different and taxes are different, but it's not really that dissimilar to buying a company in a different [U.S.] state... And there's a growing feeling out there that Canada is a stable country and a safe place to do business."" (c) 2007 Mergers and Acquisitions Journal and SourceMedia, Inc.

They don't know how to ride a bike.\""Unable to work because of congestive heart failure, Gibson can't afford to buy a bike or other Christmas presents. A victim of domestic violence, she lived in shelters for years but now gets by on disability payments and help from charities. Her family's Christmas will be thanks to the generosity of strangers through the Salvation Army's Angel Tree program.They'll be happy with whatever gifts they receive, Gibson said. \""I've raised them not to be too picky,\"" she said, adding that her boys, ages 9 and 10, haven't been told where the gifts come from. \""I just say the Lord made it right.\""Salvation Army leaders are having to work extra hard this year to make sure needy children throughout the county have something to open on Christmas morning. The ***recession** has swelled the number of families seeking help, but fewer organizations and individuals have the resources to give.\""It's my opinion that there are going to be less services available,\"" said Capt. Mark Hunter, head of the Salvation Army in Smithfield. He noted that several churches and groups had to drop out of the Angel Tree program this year.Thankfully, the number of families in the program has dropped a bit since the height of the ***recession** last year. This year, 636 families are seeking help, while last year the charity helped 869. In 2007, 263 families were in the program.Hunter said that about 40 percent of this year's families are seeking aid from the Salvation Army for the first time. The overall decrease from last year could be because of a larger number of groups offering similar services.The Johnston County Department of Social Services has an Angel Tree program for kids in its foster-care program and its adolescent parenting program, which helps teens raise children. Foster-care supervisor Tony Harris said he's seen a drop in the number of kids in foster care. This year, the Angel Tree program hopes to help about 160 kids. DSS did not keep numbers from last year's program.\""Maybe it's a sign that the market is getting better,\"" Harris said. \""It's just hard to tell.\""To give to either program, donors pick a card from an Angel Tree, located in businesses throughout the county. The card gives the child's age, gender, clothing sizes and wish list. Donors buy a new present and return it to the Angel Tree site unwrapped for inspection. Volunteers organize and distribute the presents.For the Salvation Army, monetary donations can be made through the organization's red kettles. That money goes to several holiday programs, including Angel Tree gifts.The local branch of the charity added credit card machines at three sites last weekend to make giving more convenient. The card-swipe kettles are at all Johnston County Wal-Mart stores on weekends and varying locations during the week.Though she doesn't know what her boys are getting for Christmas, Gibson -- the mother of two -- isn't worried. \""Salvation Army has always come through for us,\"" she said.colin.campbell@nando.com or 919-836-5768To see more of The Smithfield Herald or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.smithfieldherald.com/.

222,4TW4-XMB0-TXCG-816Y-00000-00.txt,"c(""ELELCTION 2008"", ""Barack Obama was elected the nation's first black president last night in a triumph that overcame racial barriers as old as America itself. The son of a black father from Kenya and a white mother from Kansas, the Democratic senator from Illinois sealed his victory by defeating Republican Sen. John McCain in a string of wins in hard-fought battleground states - Ohio, Florida, Virginia and Iowa. A huge crowd in Grant Park in Chicago erupted in jubilation at the news of Obama's victory. \""Change has come to America,\"" Obama told the gathering. In his first speech as president-elect, Obama catalogued the challenges ahead. \""The greatest of a lifetime,\"" he said, \""two wars, a planet in peril, the worst ***financial crisis** in a century.\"" He added, \""There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as president, and we know that government can't solve every problem. But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face.\"" Obama invoked the words of Lincoln and echoed John F. Kennedy in his speech. \""So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder,\"" he said. McCain called his former rival to concede defeat - and the end of his own 10-year quest for the White House. \""The American people have spoken, and spoken clearly,\"" McCain told disappointed supporters in Arizona. Obama accepted McCain's concession and asked his Republican rival for help in leading the country. Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama thanked McCain for his graciousness and said he had waged a tough race. He also said the Arizona senator was consistently someone who has showed class and honor during this campaign as he has during his entire life in public service. Gibbs quoted Obama as saying, \""I need your help; you're a leader on so many important issues.\"" President Bush called Obama to congratulate him on winning the presidency. \""What an awesome night for you, your family and your supporters,\"" Bush said, promising Obama a smooth transition to the White House. Obama and his running mate, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, will take their oaths of office as president and vice president on Jan. 20, 2009. The popular vote was close, but not the count in the Electoral College, where it mattered most. There, Obama's audacious decision to contest McCain in states that hadn't gone Democratic in years paid rich dividends. Obama has said his first order of presidential business will be to tackle the economy. He has also pledged to withdraw most U.S. combat troops from Iraq within 16 months. The 47-year-old Illinois senator was little known just four years ago. A widely praised speech at the Democratic National Convention, delivered when he was merely a candidate for the Senate, changed that. Overnight he became a sought-after surrogate campaigner, and he had scarcely settled into his Senate seat when he began preparing for his run for the White House. A survey of voters leaving polling places showed the economy was by far the top Election Day issue. Six in 10 voters said so, and none of the other top issues - energy, Iraq, terrorism and health care - was chosen by more than one in 10. The Democratic leaders of Congress celebrated in Washington. \""It is not a mandate for a party or ideology but a mandate for change,\"" said Senate Majority leader Harry Reid of Nevada. Said Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California: \""Tonight the American people have called for a new direction. They have called for change in America.\"" Shortly after 11 p.m., The Associated Press count showed Obama with 338 electoral votes, well over the 270 needed for victory. McCain had 127 after winning states that composed the normal Republican base. The nationwide popular vote was remarkably close. Totals from 58 percent of the nation's precincts showed Obama with 51 percent and McCain with 47.9. Interviews with voters suggested that almost six in 10 women were backing Obama nationwide, while men leaned his way by a narrow margin. Just over half of whites supported McCain, giving him a slim advantage in a group that Bush carried overwhelmingly in 2004. An estimated 187 million voters were registered, and in an indication of interest in the battle for the White House, 40 million or so had already voted as Election Day dawned. Obama sought election as one of the youngest presidents, and one of the least experienced in national political affairs. That wasn't what set the Illinois senator apart, though - neither from his rivals nor from the other men who had served as president since the nation's founding more than two centuries ago. A black man, he confronted a previously unbreakable barrier as he campaigned on twin themes of change and hope in uncertain times. McCain, a prisoner of war during Vietnam, a generation older than his rival at 72, was making his second try for the White House, after his defeat in the battle for the GOP nomination in 2000. A conservative, he stressed his maverick's streak. And although a Republican, he did what he could to separate himself from an unpopular president. Obama will take office in 76 days, but the moves he begins making today will immediately begin to define his presidency. He is expected to name a White House chief of staff in the next day or two, and the clear front-runner is Rep. Rahm Emanuel, his longtime friend and ally from Chicago. He will officially begin a transition operation under the direction of another Clinton administration official, former White House chief of staff John D. Podesta. Those and other prominent Democrats, many of them veterans of his two-year quest for the presidency, will be charged with assembling an administration that draws from the innovations of Obama's campaign and sets in motion a system to deliver on the promises that got him elected.""

224,7VBV-MRC1-2PG5-50MS-00000-00.txt,"SEOULTHE ORIGINS of World War II lie in the failure of the global powers to come to terms on an economic system in which all could share fairly and fully. That s what the Japanese asserted when they charged the ABCD nations   America, Britain, China and the Dutch   had conspired to cut off the oil on which Japan relied to fuel its mighty military and industrial machine. Protectionist tendencies no doubt had much to do with igniting World War II in the Pacific and Europe after global economic leaders meeting in London in the early 1930s failed to agree on a viable modus vivendi.It s easy to blame depression and then protectionism for the world s troubles. No doubt they were factors, though Japan s aggressive imperialism and Nazi Germany s conquest of much of Europe, along with mass extermination of Jews and members of other ethnic groups, would seem to go far beyond such simplistic explanations as the breakdown of the world economic order.With this background of tragedy in mind, however, leaders of the G-20, the world s 20 leading economic powers, gather in London on Thursday to try to thrash out the problems. It will be President Obama s debut on the world stage, his first sortie outside the U.S. since his inauguration, and it promises to be significant even if the whole show devolves into a talkfest in which nothing gets solved. In fact, if the G-20 breaks up with closing statements that only paper over the world s economic problems, historians forever after will be tempted to look back on the session as a turning point   for the worse.The relationship between economic troubles and war is always close if sometimes indefinable. Storm clouds loom over northeast Asia as North Korea prepares to launch a Taepodong-2 missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead as far as the U.S. West Coast. North Korea already has an array of short-and-mid-range missiles, Scuds and Rodongs, that can inundate all of South Korea and most of Japan. Nobody seriously expects North Korea to begin firing any of these soon. Nonetheless, North Korean rhetoric about  all-out confrontation  and threats of  all-out war  if anyone tries to shoot down its Taepodong-2, which it insists is the booster vehicle for a satellite, are deeply disturbing.The tensions may well worsen, and the threats of war become harshly real, if the global leaders can t deal effectively with ***economic crisis** or near-crisis. Just think of the desperation that might drive leaders in such disparate large if not great powers as China, Russia and Japan, all of which have enormous stakes as well as long and quite sinister histories on the Korean Peninsula, to compete again militarily in the region. Japan s outrage over North Korea s refusal to come clean on all the Japanese kidnapped by North Koreans from Japanese soil more than 20 years ago fuels an historic desire for dominance as seen in Japanese colonial period that did not end until the end of World War II.China, for its part, stands ready to prop up its North Korean ally, with arms and an endless supply of troops from its near-limitless population base and Russia, awakening from a generation of political indecision and economic ailments, may want to reassert its regional power in moves reminiscent of the Soviet era ended nearly 20 years ago.Nor does anyone really know the degree to which the United States, large and often unpredictable, will want to participate again in an armed struggle in the region. The U.S. holds uneasy allies together through bilateral alliances with Japan and South Korea, but economic duress could drive China, the only power behind North Korea, to decide to test the depth of the U.S. commitment. The U.S. historically has entered wars late, as in both world wars, and then when threatened or attacked, as in the case of Japan s bombing of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.The United States was still less prepared for the Korean War after withdrawing the last of its combat forces from the Korean Peninsula in 1949 and absolutely refusing to plunge into war against the Chinese Communist armies that completed their conquest of mainland China on Oct. 1 of that year. With a world ***recession** likely to last another year or so, and maybe much longer, U.S. leaders focus on domestic problems while figuring out how to extricate U.S. forces from Iraq and Afghanistan without opening the way for still bloodier religious, regional and factional strife.Leaders of the G-20 have a chance to stave off the nightmare of wars in Northeast Asia and elsewhere if they will come to terms that recognize the need to accommodate everyone s problems and resolve to reduce protectionism. Those are easy words to write or say.The danger is they will choose another form of protectionism, the protective coating of flowery statements and speeches, and then go home to formulate policies in defense of their own narrow interests and no one else s. Far preferable for this meeting to go down in history as a turning point toward resolution of problems than another missed opportunity on the road to World War III.Donald Kirk, an occasional contributor, is a long-time foreign correspondent and editor.",1,,,not so sure
225,7WTP-B3K0-YB35-R001-00000-00.txt,"The energy markets, over the past few months, proved that they are not immune to the travails of the economy. Lower crude prices, the woes of the credit market, and diminishing demand have conspired to sink oil prices, reflecting a pullback that is being experienced throughout the broader energy market. And the slump in one area impacts another, underscored by the questions facing alternatives, which no longer seem as compelling alongside cheaper traditional fuels.Mergers &amp; Acquisitions brought together top names in the space to discuss the tectonic shifts facing the energy markets. The conversation focused first on the regulatory environment and then moved to what it all means for dealmaking. Taking part in the discussion were Greenhill Capital's Frank Pottow, Pine Brook Road Partners' Craig Jarchow, Douglas Korn of Irving Place Partners (FKA: Bear Stearns Merchant Banking), Debevoise &amp; Plimpton's Maurizio Levi Minzi, and Harris William &amp; Co.'s Andrew Spitzer. The following is an edited version of the discussion.Mergers &amp; Acquisitions: Since the volatility seen in the energy market has seemed to take a lot of people by surprise, historically has energy operated in its own cycles, similar to healthcare, or was the precipitous drop in oil and gas prices something that could have been expected in light of the economy's downturn?Jarchow: Of course, you are going to have the fundamentals of supply and demand. And we are headed toward a time of economic weakness, so we are seeing a reduction in both oil and gas prices. In a sense, this was predictable because this is a cyclical business.What you want to do in a downcycle is make sure that you are not long assets or long inventory. You want to be in a position in which you can play the margins in oil and gas, because when you get a reduction in prices, you also see service costs decline. There is a delay in the reduction of service costs, but if you are long assets or long inventory, it's not so easy to play that.So, as investors, we try to be asset and inventory light. You don't want to pay for reserves. If you avoid large reserve or asset transactions at a peak, you'll be in position to play the margin when the prices go down.Mergers &amp; Acquisitions: Given the rapid fall, can we now safely say that the record prices in oil were driven by speculation, or was oil, at $147 per barrel, representative of a fundamental peak, driven by supply and demand?Pottow: Picking up on Craig's earlier point, oil and gas are cyclical commodities. They are driven in part by supply and demand, but when you talk about supply-and-demand fundamentals, you have to ask about the timeframe. Are you talking about a long-term, secular trend or are you talking about a shorter term, cyclical trend? Or are you talking about an extremely short-term capital flow? I think those questions are all very different.For example, the longer-term supply trends might focus on deliverability or the relative state of production by the global energy players. For demand, those trends will be driven by the economy, so to assume that the industry is ***recession** proof is ridiculous.Look at natural gas: You'll have shorter term trends, such as inventories. Natural gas is stored in the summers to be used in the winter, and those inventories are very important, and may play a bigger role in prices than deliverability or overall growth and demand.Then you have an even shorter term timeframe when look at the growth in what you might call speculative inventories, which is the capital flow within the sector. You had a period that started in 2002 until about June 30, 2008 in which there was a phenomenal increase in the amount of capital investing in commodity-related investments; energy-related investments in particular.I think what we're seeing now is that there are three different trends playing out. Supply and demand will go up and down over the three different timeframes and sometimes they exacerbate the other. What we have seen during the past three months is an exacerbation of all of those trends. Global demand is going down, and is expected to go down in the face of a very pronounced global ***recession**. You have an increase in deliverability of supply, because over the past five years energy companies have invested substantially more capital, increasing the productive capacity. Oil at $140 per barrel made those projects look very attractive. Also, a lot of energy companies, particularly mid-sized companies in the US, had capital expenditure budgets well in excess of their annual cash flow, so that only added to the deliverability, which typically has a lag effect.I also think you have seen a dramatic unwinding of what might be considered speculative investment positions. And if these investments are leveraged, margin calls could further drive liquidity away from the sector. But all of those are important factors.Korn: There is a distinction between oil and gas, since oil is a part of the worldwide economy and is traded globally. Gas is largely a North American phenomenon. There is some importing of LNG (liquified natural gas), but it's really a North American play.The long-term dynamics of oil - from a demand point of view - would seem to be strong. A year ago, people were caught up in the euphoria of the emerging markets and the demand coming from areas like China, Russia and India, which seemed to have this relentless thirst for oil. While to some degree it's true, that euphoria was short lived because we seeing demand destruction come from two things: the high prices and the ***economic downturn**. So on the oil side, despite the demand equation, the sentiment is heading in the wrong direction for many of the reasons Frank described.Gas, though, is largely a North American market. There has been a tremendous amount of capital flowing into North American gas, so I think it's more of a supply issue right now than demand. There may be a bit of slowing in demand around the edges, but long-term the demand equation for gas in North America is still terrific. It's clean burning, domestically produced, and economically attractive given current technologies, many of which weren't available until recently. So there is a distinction between the two.Pottow: I totally agree. I think what's going on in natural gas is very much supply driven. Deliverability in North America and the lower 48 is up dramatically for the first time in over 20 years.The other factor that is worth mentioning has been the emergence of alternative sources of supply. Ethanol, for example, has started to crimp the market demand for petrochemical fuels. But alternative sources of energy have a lot of credibility when oil is at $145 a barrel - I would imagine they'll have less credibility if oil sinks to $60.Spitzer: To echo Doug's comments, if you take a step back, a year ago people were talking about the opportunities that existed with $60 to $70 oil, even on the alternative side. There was this 12-month spike in pricing, but as it has come back down, what you have now is a psychological issue in which people don't know where things are going or if they're catching a falling knife. Natural gas, though, is more of an insular commodity, so there is not as much of this cloudiness.Jarchow: The interesting thing too about natural gas is that much of this new supply is coming from these resource plays, typically involving shale, which has a very quick decline rate. Effectively, when you drill a well you get a burst of gas and then most of your reserves can be measured very quickly. Companies are now dialing back their caps to match their cash flow, so I think you'll find the amount of production will be scaled back very quickly in response. That means that the North American natural gas market, because of these resource plays, can self correct much more quickly than in the past.Mergers &amp; Acquisitions: In light of the sharp falloff, do you think companies will be capitalized to survive this downturn in commodity prices, or will we see a fallout that opens up the same kind of opportunity people might be looking at in the banking sector right now - balance sheet issues that require fresh capital?Korn: Some companies are very well situated to survive this downturn, but others are absolutely not. Probably the biggest distinguishing factor is what kind of leverage a company has taken on. A highly leveraged company that is going in a period of down commodity prices in which liquidity dries up, will find themselves under tremendous pressure. You're already seeing this in the public market, with some companies having seen their stocks decline by 80% or more.Similarly, you may have a company that doesn't carry any debt, but has drilling commitments that they are unable to fund. It doesn't have enough cash or equity relative to the commitments. That's on the E&amp;P side (energy and production).In the services sector, it might be a similar story. People are predicting that a quarter of the rigs in North America could be idled. That's 500 rigs out of roughly 2,000, so day rates will be affected; utilization will be affected; and you'll likely see cash flow for many of these services companies plunge dramatically.There will be winners and losers, as in any major market dislocation, but one can certainly expect to see tremendous opportunities for those people with capital ready to deploy it.Mergers &amp; Acquisitions: What does all of this do to renewable energy? In the early 1980s there had been a push for cleaner energy and alternatives to oil, but that died when commodity prices sank. Conversely, you have global warming and a political climate that wants to reduce exposure to the Middle East. Will that prevent the same kind of defection from the niche?Levi Minzi: My sense is that the renewable plays will be around for the long term. They are certainly affected by what is going on in the market, and, if you look at some of the public indices, renewables have declined by 30% in the last few months. That being said, there is substantial political support for renewables, and you saw that with TARP (The Troubled Asset Relief Program).Within that, the government included the Energy Improvement and Extension Act, which represents perhaps the strongest federal endorsement of renewables. It provided an extension of the production-tax credit for wind, which was extended by just one year; included an eight-year extension of the investment tax credit for solar; and contained to the tune of about $2.5 billion capital for clean coal projects. Those are powerful incentives. They may be small numbers compared to the overall size of some of these projects, but it shows there is still strong support for that.To me, the real question is whether or not the financial turmoil will delay the passing of climate change legislation. You also have to ask: Will it even happen? Both of the presidential candidates were in favor of climate change legislation, albeit with very different approaches, whether or not we can afford to implement it right now, because it involves imposing higher prices on everyone - business and retail - remains to be seen.Pottow: That's a real issue. The example of the early '80s is a good one because what happened then is very similar to what's happening now. There was a dramatic increase in the price of crude oil as a result of the first Arab oil embargoes and there was a resulting move toward conservation. You saw efforts then to implement wind and solar and a bunch of other alternative energy initiatives, and for a variety of factors, there was a pretty dramatic drop in the price of oil. It was driven in part by consumption, which fell, I believe, by 15% to 20% over the course of a couple years. But it certainly had a big impact in discouraging the adoption of alternative forms of energy.That example probably hasn't been lost on producers in the Middle East, who see a real threat to their business. But to look at one example, which is ethanol, I think the economics from the outside appear to have been absolutely devastated by what has happened. Longer term, I'm not sure what that means, but I think that people who were quick to back that sector may be a little slower to invest substantial amounts in other newer areas. In fact, I don't think people are going to rush into anything right now in this environment.Levi Minzi: As an attorney, from my perspective the headline story next year should be climate change legislation. If it happens, you have to dissect the terms of the legislation. A cap-and-trade system would impose costs. There will be players that are providers of allowance submissions and others who will be consumers. So that will change the investment parameters for all businesses, not just energy.In terms of M&amp;A, people will need to figure out how a particular target may position itself against its peers, and how does that impact the valuation of that particular business. It's a paradigm shift, and we'll see regulation impose new ways of looking at assets that will have to be dealt with.Spitzer: Over the past three years, you saw three key constituencies come together, which had to happen if alternatives were to gain traction. There was public support, government support, which has been there for a while, and you finally saw the financial support, which hadn't been there for a long time. As Frank pointed out, people don't invest in alternatives out of the goodness of their heart. Regulatory changes can fundamentally shift the financial framework through incentives, but right now there is a lack of credit support. Given the uncertainty of cash flows, a result of the volatility and murkiness in commodity prices, it can be difficult to gauge the opportunities. Until you you get some clarity into that, I don't think you'll see significant investment in alternatives like we had just six months ago.Levi Minzi: That's an excellent point. The fact that they extended the wind production tax credit by one year doesn't really create an environment that allows you to make long-term investments.Mergers &amp; Acquisitions: As you look at the industry's prospects, whether it's oil and gas, alternatives, or electricity, how important is the regulatory environment? I'm sure it's something everyone tracks, but how much attention goes into what may or may not happen in Washington as you consider a possible deal?Jarchow: Our approach is that we'll look at an investment on its own economic merits and not even consider any incentives that may come from the government. And if the investment works on its own merits then we'll go ahead with the deal and view the incentives as possible upside. But it won't make or break a deal.Pottow: That's the same for us. We don't have any alternative energy investments for specifically that reason. We have looked at wind, and it's potentially very interesting, but without better clarity on the production tax credit it's difficult to get comfortable.Levi Minzi: I agree, but potentially you may be looking at detriments as well. So investors will track regulation with a view on how it could negatively impact investments.Pottow: That's a good point.Mergers &amp; Acquisitions: This seems like a good segue to discuss the various proposals coming out of Washington. In the recent election, energy was a major theme. From President-elect Barack Obama's pledge to eliminate dependence on foreign oil within 10 years to John McCain's ""drill baby, drill"" theme, there have been quite a few variations on how to tackle these issues. Do you guys have any thoughts on some of the proposals that were being floated?Pottow: It's really too bad that we are in the current economic situation that we're facing, because this actually got a lot of attention from both candidates. In World War II, the United States was an exporter of oil to our allies, which helped win the war. And we have gone from that position to a point now where we're importing about 67% of our oil needs. This has been an irreversible, and increasing trend.I think the risk, with oil at $60, is that we're going to turn around 10 years from now, and instead of being totally independent from foreign oil, we will be importing 75% of our needs. There are numbers that get floated around, depending on the price of oil, that there is roughly $500 billion a year that the US borrows from China to pay to the Middle East. I think that's a legitimate issue.Jarchow: Also, as it relates to oil specifically, we need to remember that that's primarily a transportation fuel. Certainly things like CAFE standards will help.(Editor's Note: CAFE standards, corporate average fuel efficiency, refer to efforts from the government to motivate automakers and consumers to shift to more fuel efficient car models.)But it's also important to remember that oil is a fungible commodity and the price is set on a worldwide basis. Ultimately, we have to focus on domestic production to help with the supply issue, and, internationally, see if we can't encourage the national oil companies to open up more acreage for competition. This is a worldwide problem; not just a US problem.Mergers &amp; Acquisitions: Is it even possible, though, to completely eliminate demand for foreign oil? Is this something that could happen in our lifetime?Spitzer: The economics certainly make it extremely challenging, and frankly, without the political willpower to put in a variety of reforms - whether it's CAFE standards or relieving offshore drilling inhibitors - it's not something that would get done without some form of government intervention.Korn: That being said, the recent turmoil in the market and the government's response have created a very difficult fiscal situation going into 2009. You have the normal cyclical impacts of a downturn in government receipts and that overlays all of the government support to shore up the markets.You have to go back to the question of whether or not there will there be the political will. There are important reasons behind why we have to become less reliant on foreign energy; from a geopolitical point of view, from a carbon emissions point of view. But how now you have to ask, ""How do we make that happen in an environment where the government will be under some severe fiscal constraints."" That's going to be the real challenge.Spitzer: And regulation is effectively a silent taxation policy. So instituting that in the face of the pocketbook issues that people are dealing with is going to be tough. Any administration would have to burn a lot of political capital to push through an energy policy that tries to accomplish what either candidate proposed.Mergers &amp; Acquisitions: Offshore drilling was one area that was hotly debated in the election. Is that a solution or just one piece of the overall puzzle?Jarchow: Every little bit counts. I do think we have to pay attention and careful attention to the environmental impact of drilling. But if you look at the record of the oil companies drilling offshore - not only in the US but internationally - the record is very good. Safety has improved markedly since 1969, when we had the Santa Barbara oil spill. That sort of thing rarely ever happens offshore anymore.Pottow: I completely agree and it's not just offshore; there are large tracts of federal land in the Rocky Mountains that are very productive. In fact, that's where a lot of the new increases in natural gas supplies have come from. But a lot of large areas are still off limits, whether they're completely off limits or require a lot of paper work, it serves to hamper domestic development.Do I think we can drill our way out of our dependence on foreign oil, though? No. I actually think that's physically impossible unless we dramatically change the use of oil as a transportation fuel and substitute it with something else. But just because something doesn't represent a complete solution doesn't mean we shouldn't try it.Spitzer: We have seen an intersection develop as it relates to energy and power. To Craig's earlier point about oil being largely a transportation fuel, you're hearing a lot of talk about potential alternatives. T. Boone Pickens, for example, has proposed natural gas as a replacement fuel for automobiles. And then there's the old adage that 75% of France's electrical power comes from nuclear. So if we were to shift to a nuclear driven electrical grid, and build the infrastructure to support that, you could also go the route in which nuclear energy powers the automotive fleet. Ultimately, that would take a lot of dependence away from fossil fuels.Levi Minzi: There is a lot of excitement in that field. Recently there have been a number of applications filed. There are, I believe, in excess of 17 applications that have been filed with the NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) recently. The interesting development from a regulatory standpoint is that the NRC now allows applicants to obtain a combined license to build and operate a plant. That should address some of the issues that emerged in the 1970s.On the other hand, there are great challenges facing nuclear. The challenges range from just finding the people to build the plants - we haven't built one since '77 - to finding the materials. For instance, there is only one facility in the world that builds the encasing necessary for modern plants. There is also the cost. These plants are huge consumers of capital and until the banks are ready to commit to the sector, it's unlikely that it will take off.Mergers &amp; Acquisitions: What about T. Boone Pickens' Pickens Plan, which Drew referred to? The plan entails using natural gas as a temporary replacement for oil, and then using wind energy to augment electricity.Jarchow: I think his plan has some value with regards to transportation, which is the issue that you really need to focus on when it comes to oil prices. Although deploying the infrastructure for compressed natural gas is quite an undertaking and shouldn't be underestimated. Eventually, his plan entails moving to battery-related technologies for cars, so ultimately there needs to be an improvement in battery technology.Mergers &amp; Acquisitions: Shifting away from the regulatory issues, Drew, could you give us your overarching view of the market from an M&amp;A perspective? As a banker, what areas within energy are seeing the most M&amp;A interest?Spitzer: Our practice is really focused on non-reserve based businesses, whether it's the oil field side or non-asset based products, technologies or services. Over the past month, we have signed two deals. One is on the downstream services side doing work in petroleum refineries and chemical plants - areas that for the most part tend to be resistant to downturns in the market. The other is what could be considered an energy efficiency play, which works even in a falling commodity-price environment.One of the things that's interesting is that when we had $30 to $40 to $50 oil, people still found opportunities. Now we've had this peak for a 12-month period, but we're back to a level that not too long ago people would have considered a great environment, with oil at around $70 a barrel. On the oilfield side, there will be some capacity and supply issues that drive things there, but I believe the long-term fundamentals of the energy market are extremely attractive.The uncertainty of where commodity prices are going will make the deal environment more challenging. We will retrench, but activity will pick up again.Mergers &amp; Acquisitions: Will the falling prices spark consolidation? I read a New York Times story recently that speculated that even Halliburton or Baker Hughes could be a target for one of the oil majors. Do you anticipate seeing strategics start to pair off if prices remain volatile?Korn: There are times in the energy cycle with respect to E&amp;P when it's cheaper to buy assets than it is to drill for them. Based on public valuations, there are strong signs that we are in one of those periods and could be for a while. It would not be at all surprising to see some of the majors, which have had trouble replacing their reserves in recent years, make some meaningful acquisitions of large independents. Similarly, the independents could go out and buy smaller companies. Whether this activity is widespread or not, we will see. But when you hit a point in which companies are trading for less than it would cost to drill the reserves, it becomes pretty compelling for the stronger players.Mergers &amp; Acquisitions: Would there be any horizontal M&amp;A activity? For instance, if ExxonMobil were to pick off Halliburton, that would be a pretty big bet on the services side?Korn: A year ago there was some very educated people who were positing that services and technologies were being constrained, and that there might be some activity among the big international players to try to improve their access to those areas. I think with the change in capital flows, this argument goes away.Spitzer: Also, historically, they can play multiple parties off of each other in down markets to get cheaper rates.Pottow: For the very large, international oil companies, the big issue they have faced over the last 20 years has been reduced access to development and growth. Back in the 1970s, a large majority of the remaining oil and gas reserves around the world were available for private ownership and development. The Exxons and Mobils still had a lot of the world available to work with. Since then, there's been an ever increasing trend toward resource nationalism, which means that there's a very small amount of remaining oil and gas reserves currently available for private ownership and development. In recent years, there's been a form of disintermediation in which the state-controlled oil and gas companies would go to an ExxonMobil for help developing a project.But the majors are very well capitalized and they have great balance sheets. Exxon has a Triple A credit rating and $30 billion of cash. They can sit back and look at companies that may be trading at less than the cost to recreate them or maybe they can wait it out to see if they can get a better deal from some of these national governments, like Russia, which might be constrained with their own budget concerns.Jarchow: We are already seeing that. In Australia, for instance, it's effectively a resource play in which the majors make moves for large reserves. BG Group just bought Queensland Gas Company and ConocoPhillips just entered the market.Pottow: That's a good point. It's a very dynamic marketplace, and typically, transactions among these bigger companies free up ancillary assets to be divested to smaller entities. There is an incredible food chain that goes all the way down to the guy drilling a well in his backyard. We saw this happen a few years ago, when the majors were consolidating. There was an awful lot of this follow-up activity.Spitzer: One of the interesting dynamics is that the larger players, who had divested assets over the years, are now buying these businesses back up. Chesapeake Energy is reported to be in play and you saw Goodrich buy Haynesville Shale in June. The majors are coming back in to buy these assets because they are so limited in terms of finding other areas of growth.Another factor is that you have this situation in which there's a dislocation between the public and private valuations in the market. Oilfield stocks are down 65% or more. And the private sellers are largely deciding to wait for the market to firm before they move back in. On the public side, it's interesting because we have seen several oilfield companies whose stock has been depressed still express interest in pursuing an acquisition strategy. They're actually offering stock at depressed levels to try and make those deals happen because they believe it's accretive to their long-term growth plan. Ultimately, what that means is that they're offering a lower price to the seller, but they're offering up their stock at the same time, which might be at a depressed level relative to its long-term value.Mergers &amp; Acquisitions: What about the electricity side? Maurizio, are there any trends that you've seen develop there?Levi Minzi: Just a few days ago, Exelon Corp. made an unsolicited bid to takeover NRG Energy, so that is a clear indication that we could be entering an environment of more consolidation.It seems to me that there will be transactions in a variety of sectors in energy. There is a clear need, for example, to upgrade the electric grid. The grid, as it stands now, is antiquated; it doesn't work. And if you are really going to develop a wind industry, we need to expand the grid. We need to make it more of a ""smart"" grid, and if that happens it would generate opportunities for investment that in turn would require the IPPs (independent power producers) and the utilities to pony up a lot of capital.There will also be opportunities among the renewables, such as wind, in the sense that as we move beyond the startup phase, there may be rollups involving some of the smaller operators.Mergers &amp; Acquisitions: The NRG bid outwardly seems like more of a distressed play, and we saw MidAmerican pick up Constellation Energy at a depressed price recently. As it relates to the entire energy space, do you think we'll see more distressed opportunities crop up? And who will be able to take advantage?Korn: Distress has clearly come into the picture, although sitting here in late October, it's really a phenomenon of the last 30 days or so driven by a combination of commodity prices and liquidity drying up. But it's starting. I would posit that we are in the early stages of it, and the solutions can come from a variety of sources. There will be great opportunities for private equity; there will be distressed investors who get into it through buying up the debt; and there will be strategics. This should last a while.Pottow: Doug is exactly right. There are very good companies out there that have their bonds trading at 80 to 85 cents, some lower. These are quality companies with strong assets and good operations. But access to capital is going to be an important differentiating force going forward. Up until July, distressed opportunities in energy were like the Holy Grail - you would look for it, but you couldn't actually find it.Korn: They didn't exist.Pottow: Now you are seeing things and, as you know, energy is a very capital intensive industry, particularly in exploration and production. And E&amp;P assets are naturally depleting, so if you don't spend any money on them, every day you'll have less than you had the day before. It's the low-cost producers that have survived other cycles and in a depressed-commodity environment, are the ones that end up making it to the other end. Also access to capital is critical.You've seen a phenomenal amount of money trade hands in the E&amp;P space over the last year, which went to buying up land. Typically, that's the thing that falls the fastest and the furthest until the environment turns around. On a daily basis I think we are seeing a recalibration of land values. It's essentially the spec housing of the energy business.Mergers &amp; Acquisitions: Will we start to see some public-to-private activity?Jarchow: In theory, that would make sense. In practice, though, it's always difficult to pull them off. We have found that you are better off addressing the issues that the public might have directly. So if it is a capital constraint that the public entity might be dealing with, then you are better off structuring a joint venture around an asset that might make for an interesting play.Spitzer: I think public to privates are going to be difficult in the near term. Just given how quickly the falloff has happened, the uncertainty needs to move into the rearview mirror before public to privates start taking place.As Craig alluded to, companies are being rewarded for finding liquidity, and I know a lot of private equity firms are out there looking for PIPE opportunities. In those situations, dilution will be necessary in order to get that liquidity. In the near term, especially on the E&amp;P side, I'm expecting to see private equity firms moving in to help out the stronger players.Mergers &amp; Acquisitions: Speaking of liquidity, what does the credit market look like these days? As it relates to private equity, can firms even find debt to pursue a leveraged buyout?Spitzer: Leverage is certainly down if there is even any credit available. It's also different lenders than you might have seen six months ago.Jarchow: We are actually as busy as we ",1,,,
231,7V9J-SX81-2R6B-01SV-00000-00.txt,"WASHINGTON » The post office will run out of money this year unless it gets help, Postmaster General John Potter told Congress on Wednesday as he sought permission to cut delivery to five days a week.""We are facing losses of historic proportion. Our situation is critical,"" Potter told a House panel.The agency lost $2.8 billion last year and is looking at much larger losses this year. Reducing mail delivery from six days to five days a week could save $3.5 billion annually, Potter said.Potter also urged changes in how the post office pre-pays for retiree health care to cut its annual costs by $2 billion.If the Postal Service does run out of money, the lingering question, Potter told the House Oversight post office subcommittee, is which bills will be paid and which will not. Ensuring the payment of workers' salaries comes first, he said, but other bills may have to wait.Potter first raised the possibility of delivery cutbacks in January, but the idea has not been warmly received in Congress.""With the Postal Service facing budget shortfalls, the subcommittee will consider a number of options to restore financial stability and examine ways for the Postal Service to continue to operate without cutting services,"" subcommittee chairman Stephen F. Lynch, D-Mass., said.Lynch said the financial stability of the Postal Service is ""critical to the American expectation of affordable six-day mail delivery.""Even if the agency succeeds in reaching its planned cost cuts of $5.9 billion, there could still be a $6 billion deficit in 2010, Potter said.""Without a change we will exhaust our cash resources,"" he said. ""We can no longer afford business as usual.""Asked if layoffs would occur, Potter said it is possible but he hopes avoidable.Last week, the post office said it planned to offer early retirement to 150,000 workers and is eliminating 1,400 management positions and closing six of its 80 district offices in cost-cutting efforts. Potter said he expects 10,000 to 15,000 workers to accept the early retirement offer.Dan Blair, head of the independent Postal Regulatory Commission, suggested that other savings are possible through closing small and rural post offices -- something Congress has resisted in the past. He added that it may be necessary to increase the limit on the amount of debt the post office can carry.The post office had a $384 million loss in the first quarter of the fiscal year -- October through December -- which is usually the busiest period because of the holidays.Officials said the ***recession** has contributed to a mail volume drop of 5.2 billion pieces compared to the same period last year. If there is no economic recovery, the USPS projects volume for the year will be down by 12 billion to 15 billion pieces of mail.Over the past year the post office says it has cut 50 million work hours, stopped construction of new facilities, frozen salaries for executives, began selling unused facilities and has cut post office hours.Last year's high fuel prices also sapped funds from the post office, which operates more than 200,000 vehicles. Every 1-cent increase in the price of fuel costs the post office $8 million.Blair also noted that Congress could consider appropriating money to help the post office. The agency does not receive a taxpayer subsidy for its operations, although Congress does subsidize overseas voting and free mail for the blind.William Young, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, stressed in his testimony that the agency is not seeking a taxpayer bailout, ""but we are here to ask the Congress for help.""""At this moment, the survival of the Postal Service -- a venerable institution that is literally older than our country -- hangs in the balance,"" Young added.Lawmakers also raised questions regarding recent news reports that Potter is paid as much as $800,000 a year. That is not correct, Potter said. He said his salary, set by Congress, is $263,575. He said the news reports were counting his retirement fund, the cost of his security detail and a $135,000 bonus that would be paid over 10 years after he retires.The bonus is based on improved delivery rates and customer satisfaction, he said. Under the current financial conditions, Potter said, he would not be eligible for a bonus this year. ",1,,,

There is no doubt that he will change the status quo.As a former professor of constitutional law, Obama has a deep-seated love and respect for the constitution and has vowed to reverse many of the executive orders Bush used to expand his authority and legalize things like waterboarding.It is impossible to know everything the future will bring, such as how long the economy will be in a downturn, how many jobs will be cut and how many more companies will want tax dollars for another ever-dreaded bailout.But we do know some things for sure.We know we can look forward to a gradual end to the war in Iraq which has cost thousands of lives and drained our nation financially.

233,4V4M-BY40-TWX3-K1MF-00000-00.txt,"A deadly fire blamed on an untended candle has drawn attention to a case last month before the Public Utility Commission that centered on whether a central Pennsylvania power company wrongly cut off electricity to a Dauphin County family. Advocates for Pennsylvania's poor say the case highlights a larger concern, especially in the face of winter and a deep ***recession**: that sharp increases in cutoffs this year by Pennsylvania utilities could lead not only to widespread hardship but also to more tragedies. The advocates say the case also illustrates problems stemming from a 2004 law that loosened termination rules, such as by allowing terminations on Fridays. The Dauphin County fire killed Britton Donachy, 2, and his sister Onna, 1, on Saturday, Nov. 3, 2007, a day after PPL Electric Utilities Corp.terminated service because the children's parents hadn't paid their bill. Dauphin County authorities blame the parents for the fire. Ryan and Debbie Donachy were charged with criminal homicide, endangering the welfare of a child, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Ryan Donachy is scheduled for trial Monday. But the PUC conducted its own inquiry, looking more narrowly into the events that led to the termination, and did not like what it found either. PUC investigators concluded that PPL Electric had broken various rules in the case and ultimately had erred in terminating service. The utility disputed the findings, but has agreed to settle the case by promising to modify its procedures and by paying $300,000 to a fund that aids financially distressed customers. This week, lawyers who represent low-income consumers challenged the tentative settlement as a slap on the wrist for a company that reported more than $1 billion in profit on $6.5 billion in revenue last year, and called instead for the PUC to impose at least $10 million in fines. The advocates also repeated a call for restoration of consumer protections eliminated in 2004 by passage of Act 201, best known for ending a 30-year moratorium on most winter terminations. Among the other protections the law ended was the bar on Friday terminations, which had been prohibited because of the difficulty in getting aid or having a mistaken shutoff reversed over a weekend. The law also dropped a rule that all shutoffs be preceded by in-person notification - though such notice is still required during winter. ""If you have face-to-face notice, maybe you see that there are infants there,"" said Jonathan M. Stein, general counsel at Philadelphia's Community Legal Service, which joined the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project in contesting the settlement. ""Or maybe you see an older person with Alzheimer's, or a person on kidney dialysis."" PPL spokesman Ryan Hill said the utility ""followed all the relevant laws and regulations."" He called shutoffs ""a last resort - something we'll consider only when all other means of collecting from a customer have failed."" On Monday, the PUC is due to report to the legislature on how well Act 201 is working. Also due next week are data from Pennsylvania utilities' annual cold-weather surveys, which last year identified nearly 17,000 households around the state that were entering winter without a working source of central heat after a utility termination. Through October, Peco Energy had terminated 68,758 of about 1.4 million residential customers - a 41 percent increase over the same period in 2007. Peco's reconnections had also risen in that same period: up 43 percent over 2007, to 45,923, according to PUC data. Terminations by Philadelphia Gas Works also jumped, 26 percent, to 28,426 of the 480,000 households it serves. The municipal utility said this week that about 9,000 households still lacked service, despite efforts to work out payment plans and connect customers with sources of assistance. ""It's obviously a bigger number than we want,"" said PGW vice president Steve Hershey. Spokeswoman Cathy Engel said Peco would not release until Monday data on households without service. Statewide, the PUC said 274,081 gas and electric customers had been terminated during the first 10 months of the year, 20 percent more than during the same period in 2007. Service had been restored to 185,155 customers. Utility officials caution that the difference between terminations and reconnections can't be taken as a count of households without utility service. By Oct. 31, 2007, for example, Peco had terminated 15,000 more customers than it had reconnected, but its winter canvass found only 1,500 households without heat. ""Some properties go vacant. Sometimes, customers reconnect with a new account number and name,"" said Engel, the Peco spokeswoman. In other cases, she said, canvassers find that a dwelling is getting service illegally, such as by tapping into power lines or running extension cords from a neighboring apartment. Harry Geller, who heads the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project, warned that service thefts share a characteristic with legal accommodations such as space heaters: Both put household members and others in jeopardy. ""People are unable to live without heat or light, and they're going to make some sort of makeshift arrangements that put them and their neighbors at risk,"" Geller said. Those risks are evident in a document that the PUC released this week in response to a request by The Inquirer under Pennsylvania's open-records law. Maintained informally by staff members at the agency, the document tracks media accounts of fire deaths and other fatalities apparently linked to utility terminations. This year, the list includes two incidents and 11 deaths. In January, a 26-year-old man died of carbon-monoxide poisoning in Allegheny County at a home without power where a generator was being used and a stove and oven were found on. In the other case, a Brockway, Pa., worker on the night shift lost his wife and nine children and grandchildren in a house that lacked gas service where space heaters were being used. Advocates such as Stein and Geller say the shutoff problem has been aggravated by Act 201 and the resulting loss of consumer protections, including PUC oversight of payment plans. Utilities say the old rules made it harder for them to exert leverage on customers who ignore other warnings. ""Termination is the last resort for us,"" said Peco's Engel. ""Unfortunately, there are customers who have the ability to pay and do not pay for the service they receive until they're in the termination process."" Stein said the PUC list of deaths, which counts 10 in the four years before the law's passage and 29 in the four years after it, supports his belief that Act 201 has put more Pennsylvanians at risk. ""These deaths will be repeated,"" Stein said. ""The biggest factor we see is the weakening of the safety net as a result of Act 201.""

For all the talk of foreclosures, the homeownership rate is higher than it was in 2000. The Dow, meanwhile, has dropped all the way to -- where it was in April 2007.Washington could yet make our economic problems into a crisis. The Federal Reserve has probably loosened monetary policy too much, generating inflation both at home and abroad and weakening the dollar. If it does not tighten, it should at least make it clear that it will not loosen any further.The Senate has passed a mostly worthless bill to stimulate the housing market. It includes a $7,000 tax credit for purchasers of foreclosed property. One would think that falling property values provided sufficient incentive for buyers. People who have been faithfully making their payments and are now trying to sell their homes should cry foul. Not only do they have the bad luck of selling in a buyer's market; they may also have to cut their price an additional $7,000 to match the deal on the foreclosed house down the block.The bill is a bipartisan fiasco, but the Democrats have made two uniquely bad contributions to the economic debate. They have blocked a trade deal the chief effect of which would be to cut Colombian tariffs on our exports. And they have suggested that trouble in our housing market is somehow the result of the Iraq War. (Get ready for it: ""Bush lied us into ***recession**."")Higher-toned Democrats are blaming the financial deregulation of the late 1990s for the present mess -- a way of fingering Phil Gramm, who sponsored that deregulation as a senator and now advises John McCain. Even some conservative journalists have bought this idea. It makes no sense. Gramm's legislation allowed banks to acquire securities firms and insurance companies; the securities firms that have faced crises recently had no affiliations with banks.What McCain is saying is, by contrast, mostly sensible. More than his Democratic rivals, he has stressed the importance of not penalizing responsible borrowers and lenders to help the irresponsible. We are skeptical that even his limited plan to help ""deserving"" homeowners will be able to weed out the speculators and avoid slowing down the housing market's self-correction -- but at least McCain is looking for limits. His plan to suspend the gas tax and stop adding to the strategic petroleum reserve should prove popular, and will do no damage. His announced hostility to corporate welfare should also prove popular, and may help lower federal spending.His tax policy is pro-growth and pro-family. He would cut the corporate tax rate, repeal the alternative minimum tax, and double the dependent exemption. We might quibble over the details, but he is headed in the right direction -- which is more than we can say of most people in Washington, including his Republican colleagues in Congress.",1,,,
235,7V37-0JK1-2R00-536X-00000-00.txt,"So many new worlds were opened by a pair of new-music concerts on Sunday that all points of reference were challenged. But were audiences left behind? Rarely, if only because any musical experiments therein had important things to say. Either the creators had a lot on their minds or the performers who chose them were looking to address audiences with urgency.An Astral Artists recital at the Trinity Center included, among other things, a sax sonata written with quarter tones by Russian composer Edison Denisov, while the American Composers Orchestra, conducted by George Manahan at University of Pennsylvania's International House, featured a new video opera with images sampled from low-budget 1950s and '60s science-fiction movies. Both were hugely engaging, with pieces that are ready for classical prime time in higher-ticket venues.That's particularly surprising in the case of the American Composers Orchestra: Though based in Carnegie Hall's Zankel space, the organization exists to upend the status quo with symphonic magnitude. In Cryosphere, Rand Steiger combined slabs of glistening orchestral colors and atmospheric electronics with Zen-like unity (like Kaija Saariaho) in a tone poem inspired by the dissolution of icebergs. Blocks of endlessly detailed but directionless sound so deftly defy the typical beginning, middle and end, I didn't want it to stop.Fang Man (a Chinese composer who, for the record, is female) delivered a clarinet concerto titled Resurrection inspired by the stylized chaos and narrative formality of Peking opera - full of crazed, intricate interplay, and with a level of energy and invention that more-mainstream Chinese composers, such as Tan Dun, have lost of late.For all its outwardly playful demeanor, Margaret Brouwer's 20-minute video opera Breakdown was four fearlessly scathing scenes about America's current ***economic crisis**. Assembled by Kasumi (also female), the video began with the sky falling, raining down seemingly benign but incongruous doll heads. Subsequent scenes were stuffed with quick-cutting machine and money images, concluding a heavy-handed section in which the word lies was spewed everywhere. The black-and-white film clips (from The Brain That Wouldn't Die, among others) often cut in and out in nanoseconds, with the score employing whatever appropriate musical color was needed for characterization. The totality was ingenious.The Astral concert was innovative as much by necessity as by design. This service organization for young artists doesn't stick to traditional solo instrumentalists, and in this joint recital by saxophonist Doug O'Connor, cellist Susan Babini, and pianist Spencer Myer, the sax section inevitably looked to composers from Denisov to Luciano Berio to John Harbison for serious repertoire. Harbison even revealed a fun, jazzy side in his San Antonio Sonata. Berio's Sequenza IX showed O'Connor can do seemingly anything coloristically, plus astounding background/foreground effects.He used the quarter tones in Denisov's Sonata for Alto Saxophone and Cello in ways that gave an oily, undulating profile to any given passage, and created textures resembling guitar feedback. A lesser performance would suggest an oblique relationship between the instruments; on Sunday, the piece projected alienation with the profundity of painter Edward Hopper. In traditional repertoire, Babini and Myer were mesmerizing in Rachmaninoff's Sonata for Cello and Piano, with all the surging impetuosity you'd want but also Mozartean clarity of structure. Might those be the sort of insights that come with having probed the depths of Denisov?Contact music critic David Patrick Stearns at dstearns@phillynews.com. ",0,,,
236,4S7B-M7K0-TX2J-21KR-00000-00.txt,"Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya doesn't look like a revolutionary. With his sober black suits and neatly clipped white moustache, he looks the archetypal fifty-something Turkish bureaucrat. Yet Yalcinkaya--the chief prosecutor of Ankara's Court of Appeals--has set into motion a series of events that effectively puts the Turkish government on trial. Last month he filed an indictment with Turkey's constitutional court that seeks to shut down Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) for the crime of ""undermining Turkey's secular Constitution"" and ban from politics more than 70 AKP members, including most of the cabinet, the prime minister and the president, for years. The court has agreed to hear the case, and if Yalcinkaya wins, it would amount to nothing less than ""a pre-emptive coup by the judiciary,"" says veteran Turkish commentator Cengiz Candar.But unlike Turkey's previous coups--which have included three tanks-on-the-street military putsches and one constitutional ""soft"" coup since 1960--the Army, the historic defender of Turkish secularism, has remained scrupulously silent. This time it's the judiciary, which, by its own account, is defending Turkey's staunchly secularist state against what it sees as the AKP's encroaching Islamism.At base, this is a conflict over who runs Turkey. Is it the old Republican elite, fanatically loyal to the principles of Turkey's founder, Kemal Ataturk? Or is it the new, democratically elected AKP, which wants to take Turkey into Europe yet also, undoubtedly, intends to bring Islam closer to the political mainstream? Yet the roots of this conflict go far deeper than the endless debate over secularism versus religion. This is also a conflict over whether the Turkish people can be trusted to choose their own rulers and policies--or whether their democratic choice is to be managed by a class of self-appointed guardians. Clearly, the old Republican elite believes it is its mission to save the people from themselves, and the elite seem willing to go to almost any length to preserve its decades-old supremacy, including destabilizing Turkey's fragile economic stability with prolonged legal wrangling and alienating Turkey's allies in the West.Optimists hope the upshot of this battle will be a more equitable, more democratic political system, of the sort the EU has been lobbying for years. But that outcome is far from certain--and will only come after months of political wrestling. Yalcinkaya's indictment doesn't leave Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan any room for compromise. If the Constitutional Court agrees with Yalcinkaya, the AKP and its leaders will be effectively wiped off the political map. Yet Erdogan's only defense is to use the AKP's popular support and its parliamentary majority to change the Constitution to limit the court's powers before they get a chance to shut it down. Such changes will permanently limit the powers of the judiciary, and profoundly change Turkey's political landscape.So far, Erdogan has publicly played down the crisis. He ordered aides and parliamentarians to maintain a strict silence about the coming trial. ""The judiciary will do its duty, and the government will continue to go about its business,"" Erdogan said last week. While his aides prepare the government's court defense, Erdogan is also working full tilt to select a slew of constitutional reforms that could save the party's life. The parliamentary arithmetic is tricky. The AKP controls more than 60 percent of the votes in Parliament, as well as the presidency. That's not quite enough to change the Constitution without the support of other parties. But there's a crucial loophole. The AKP has enough votes to call a national referendum to force through its proposed constitutional amendments.To that end, the government is preparing a kind of ""Ã  la carte"" reform package that bundles measures to remove the Constitutional Court's powers to ban political parties with a bunch of reforms long demanded by the European Union. Among them: scrapping Article 301 of the penal code, which criminalizes ""insulting Turkishness"" and has been used to prosecute a series of writers and journalists, most notably Nobel Prize-winning author Orhan Pamuk. Another would allow state TV and radio to broadcast more programs in the Kurdish language--a key demand of the EU and of moderate Kurdish parliamentarians.The fact that the judiciary could threaten to oust a popularly elected government exposes deep flaws in the present Constitution, which was penned by the military in the wake of a 1980 coup. It is powerfully Kemalist, and shot through with a deep distrust of politicians and Parliament, and accordingly grants the judiciary sweeping powers to supervise and overrule elected governments. Prof. Ergun Ozbudun, a leading constitutional expert at Ankara's Bilkent University who has worked on suggested revisions to Turkey's basic law, calls the present system a ""supervised democracy""--one that is ""very far from the democratic standards which exist in the West, and which Turkey aspires to adopt.""Even if the struggles between the government and the courts eventually create a more stable political system, and that's a big if, the economic cost will have been enormous. In the wake of Yalcinkaya's indictment, the Turkish lira lost nearly 13 percent of its value, and even staunchly secularist institutions like the union of Turkish industrialists called the court's attack on the AKP ""unacceptable."" Yet many ultrasecularists are prepared to sacrifice Turkey's newfound prosperity to preserve their privileges, argues Ihsan Dagi, professor of international relations at Middle East Technical University in Ankara. ""Bureaucrats see the market economy as a threat since it erodes their power by enabling people to make their own fortunes ... without relying on the state and its bureaucratic patronage,"" says Dagi.The wild card in this clash is Turkey's most powerful ultrasecularists: the military. So far, top generals have maintained an absolute silence, but if their past tendencies are a guide, they likely support Yalcinkaya's indictment. Yet the military is also careful to safeguard its own popularity, and in the past has intervened only against unpopular governments, or to stave off political anarchy. The AKP is demonstrably popular, and the last time the military intervened in politics it got into serious trouble. Last summer when the AKP was trying to get its founding member, Abdullah Gul, elected to the presidency, the military posted a note on its Web site casting doubts about the constitutionality of the parliamentary vote. Turkey's Constitutional Court, perhaps following the military's lead, duly declared the process invalid. The AKP immediately called a new general election and won an even larger share of the vote, putting the military squarely on the wrong side of popular opinion.So barring the highly unlikely prospect of a military intervention, the government's democratic mandate will, in all probability, eventually trump the court's waning authority, based as it is on an undemocratic Constitution. But such an outcome presents a different set of problems. For all its faults, the judiciary is the only ""safety valve"" that Turkey has against ""a violation of the fundamental principles of the Republic,"" says law professor Mumtaz Soysal, a prominent secularist. With the judiciary's constitutional powers reduced, even moderate secularists who oppose Yalcinkaya's indictment fear there will be nothing to stop the AKP from pushing an Islamist program. That's the kind of revolution the Turkish judiciary definitely did not envision.",0,,,

240,4V8G-3710-TX33-C1GG-00000-00.txt,"WASHINGTON -- Members of Congress have at least one reason to ring in the new year: They've given themselves a $4,700-a-year pay raise starting tomorrow.With the economy in a ***recession** and millions of Americans losing their jobs, however, members are under fire to rescind the pay hike, which will increase their base salaries to $174,000, roughly a 2.8 percent raise.Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California will get a larger raise of about $6,100, though it's about the same percent increase. Her salary will rise to nearly $223,500. Ms. Pelosi's office declined to comment on the raise.When Congress begins a new session next Tuesday, critics have an idea for the first vote: Block the 2009 raise for all 535 senators and representatives.""Certainly, the timing could be a lot better. ... When you look at the rest of the country, people are hoping to hang on to their jobs, much less get a salary increase or a bonus,"" said Steve Ellis, the vice president of the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense.Other critics say that Congress has done nothing to deserve a raise.""The general public can't help but think that lawmakers are patting themselves on the back and padding their wallets for presiding over the worst fiscal-policy blunders in recent history,"" said Pete Sepp, vice president for policy and communications for the National Taxpayers Union.The issue is always sensitive for members of Congress, who have designed a way to raise their pay automatically without even having to vote. They call it a cost-of-living allowance that takes effect each year, unless members vote to turn it down. Conveniently, it allows them to leave no evidence that could be used against incumbents in re-election campaigns.""It's a gimmick to essentially avoid something that would be politically dicey,"" Mr. Ellis said. ""And both parties are complicit in this system and benefit from it.""Members of Congress don't often snub an opportunity to make more money. It happened in 2007, when the Democratic-led Congress decided to forgo a raise because it hadn't approved an increase in the minimum wage. Last January, members received an automatic increase of 2.5 percent.Mr. Ellis said that Congress would be wise to delay its 2009 raise until the ***recession** ended or unemployment declined. That would show that public officials are making a ""shared sacrifice"" during times of economic difficulty, he said.While members of Congress will receive a raise, 12 percent of seniors are living at or below the poverty line, said Daniel O'Connell, chairman of The Senior Citizens League.The congressional pay raise is expected to cost taxpayers $2.5 million next year.Four members of Congress from Indiana have announced that they won't accept the pay increase: Democratic Sen.

242,7WHJ-YTX1-2R2Y-7388-00000-00.txt,"c(""Sep. 1--The five-member panel formed to consider the future of the Owensboro Riverport Authority has been at work for about two months now.The committee appointed by Owensboro Ron Payne is charged with answering the question of whether the city-owned riverport should be privatized and, if so, what that change should consist of.By all accounts, the group's members are undertaking their task diligently and in the open. Its regularly scheduled meetings are open to anyone interested, and the panel's members are responsive to suggestions and questions. Members of the business community and the public have attended the meetings, no doubt to get a sense of how the committee is leaning and perhaps to help guide their decision.At a recent meeting, the committee compiled a list of possibilities for the riverport's future that ranged from keeping the same arrangement to completely divesting the city of any interest in the riverport.\""But as we are finding out, there's a whole passel of opportunities beyond those two extremes. ... We can recommend something between those two if we choose to,\"" said the committee's chairman, Alan Braden.Included in the possible scenarios the group is considering is keeping the land and selling all the assets, hiring a third-party private firm to run the facility, developing the land to be resold or looking to the state to take a more active role.Looking at the spectrum of possibilities adds validity to the process itself. To this point, the members have not publicly indicated they are leaning toward recommending a particular scenario and appear open to all possibilities.That should help ease some concerns about whether Payne or the group are undertaking this task with a set agenda. A change in the riverport's ownership structure of course has the potential to benefit the city. Some in the private sector also have a chance to benefit under some of the possibilities the committee is seeking, so it is even more important to keep this process beyond reproach.Given the ongoing success of the riverport, any argument to change the status quo will have to be a strong one. The same goes for the sale of any of the riverport's property or assets. The economy is in ***recession**, which would make it more challenging for the city to realize a complete return on its investment in the riverport over the years.As the committee moves forward, it should operate under the default assumption that the riverport should remain owned and operating as it is now. At this time, there does not seem to be a compelling reason to change that structure, though the work of this committee could indeed produce one.Above all, keeping this process open to the public and keeping an open mind will be vital to producing a viable recommendation in the end.To see more of the Messenger-Inquirer, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.messenger-inquirer.com.

244,53Y6-YK11-F12G-D3FP-00000-00.txt,"65 YEARS AGOOn August 13, 1944, The Palestine Post reported on the fierce battle for Paris. The fast Allied move had trapped some 250,000 Germans, and the Nazis were moving out from the French capital.The Soviet drive westward was considerably slowed down in central Poland, but continued in the Baltic countries.Winston Churchill visited Italy and celebrated the capture of Florence.The Soviet writer Simonov described in Red Star the horrors of the Nazi death camp near Lublin, an exact replica of the notorious Dachau camp, which was able to dispose of about 14,000 corpses daily.The fighting in Warsaw between the heavily armed Germans and the Polish defenders continued unabated. While there were some remaining Jews among the Polish soldiers and civilians, the Germans were still searching for them and shooting them on the spot.50 YEARS AGOAgriculture Minister Kadish Luz told the Post that he would look into the charges by Yosef Weitz, of the Jewish National Fund, that woodlands of his ministry's Afforestation Department were poorly managed and showed a substandard survival rate.Prof. Binyamin Mazar, president of the Hebrew University, told the meeting of the Israel Exploration Council that there was an urgent need for an Israeli Supreme Archeological Council to coordinate all archeological work and exploration being done in the country. He was supported by Dr. Yigael Yadin, who said that only such a council could bring some order into the current archeological research conducted in Israel. Yadin had also announced that the plans for the building of the National Museum, which was to have both archeological and art sections, were progressing satisfactorily.25 YEARS AGOOn August 13, 1984, The Jerusalem Post reported that there was no narrowing of gaps in national unity talks on the formation of a Likud-Labor government coalition which would command a big majority in the Knesset. However, it was agreed, after a fourth round of negotiations, on the creation of two working groups: one which would concentrate on the common foreign and defense policy, and the other on the economic and social policy.Science and Development Minister Yuval Ne'eman, head of the joint Ministerial-World Zionist Organization Settlement Committee, said that he hoped to establish five more settlements in Judea and Samaria.",0,,,
245,7V1P-92P0-Y9BJ-2000-00000-00.txt,"Repeatedly talking down the American economy, Barack Obama, pushing the so-called ""stimulus"" package, incessantly claimed that we're ""going through the worst ***economic crisis** since the Great Depression."" In fact, he was off by four decades. It's the worst economy since Jimmy Carter. Ronald Reagan inherited rates of 13.5 percent inflation and 7.6 percent unemployment from Carter in 1980, a misery index (the inflation rate added to the unemployment rate) of 21.1. Obama, in contrast, came into office with a January 2009 unemployment rate of 7.6 percent and a zero rate of inflation, a misery index of 7.6 percent, a third of the inflation/unemployment problem that Reagan faced. Reversing his ""hope over fear"" campaign slogan, Obama proclaimed that he'd ""inherited the most profound economic emergency since the Great Depression,"" a ""crisis"" that would turn into a ""catastrophe,"" possibly ""irreversible,"" if we didn't hurry up and get on board with his trillion-dollar package of pork, political payoffs and ""shovel-ready"" government projects, the largest expansion of government in American history. At last count, the mayor of Las Vegas was seeking $2 million for more neon, Chula Vista, Calif., wanted a new $500,000 dog park, the mayor of Pittsfield in Maine sought money to patch his ""pain in the hiney"" potholes, and Shreveport, La., appealed for eight new Harleys for the cops and six new water slides, all with money to be deducted from our paychecks or borrowed from China. With Reagan, the solution was the opposite. Seeking to unleash the productivity and job-creating potential of the private sector and reverse the downward slide of Carter's high-inflation, big-government, high-unemployment, slow-growth economy, Reagan's answer was to get government out of the way by way of reductions in government red tape and an across-the-board tax cut that reduced the nation's top income-tax rate from 70 percent to 28 percent. The result? The worst economy since the Great Depression turned into the largest economic boom in American history, a 20-year surge of investment, entrepreneurial risk-taking and economic growth. Inflation and unemployment rates of 13.5 percent and 7.6 percent in 1980 dropped, respectively, to 4.1 percent and 5.5 percent by the conclusion of Reagan's presidency in 1989. Altogether, 19 million jobs were created from 1982 through 1988, more than the total number of jobs created in Europe and Japan combined, producing real (adjusted for inflation) income gains in every income quintile. The poverty population, after expanding by 7 million in the late 1970s, dropped by 4 million in the 1980s. Explains Stephen Moore, senior economics writer at The Wall Street Journal: ""In 1982, the Dow Jones average hit a low of 800. After the final pieces of the Reagan tax cuts were installed, the market rocketed upward for 18 consecutive years. From 800, the Dow rose to 10,000, creating between $15 trillion and $20 trillion in new wealth and industries. The Dow would have to climb to 100,000 by 2020 to match this Herculean performance."" Similarly, President John F. Kennedy presented his prescription for economic growth in a speech in December 1962 before the Economic Club of New York: ""It is increasingly clear that no matter what party is in power, so long as our national security needs keep rising, an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance the budget, just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits. In short, it is paradoxical that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now."" In 1963, Kennedy asked Congress for an across-the-board tax cut that would reduce the top income-tax rate from 91 percent to 65 percent. Subsequently, Congress reduced the top rate to 70 percent. Explains Bruce Bartlett, a White House economist in the Reagan administration: ""Once upon a time, in the not-too-distant past, there was a Democratic president who was not obsessed with class warfare, as today's Democrats are."" The result? Unemployment dropped from 5.2 percent in 1964 to 3.8 percent in 1966 and annual tax revenues, with lower rates, jumped 33 percent in real terms, adjusted for inflation, from 1961 to 1968. What we're getting from Obama is the exact opposite, a program for expanded government, more regulations, more mandates and higher tax rates for the nation's key job creators. ",1,,,
246,7X51-N071-2PBB-20DJ-00000-00.txt,"c(""E-mail: Generationb@nytimes"", ""BABY boomers have lived during an era of unparalleled prosperity. So when this deep ***recession** hit --  at a time when boomers were advancing to middle- and late-middle age --  much was written about them being too spoiled to cope.  Not so. A look at recent employment data indicates that boomers have persevered in these hard times, and are less likely to grow discouraged and quit the job hunt than younger workers are.  ''Older adults are not giving up,'' said Steven Hipple, a Bureau of Labor Statistics economist. Despite the fact that the unemployment rate for baby boomers has doubled since the start of the ***recession**, what the federal government calls their ''labor participation rate'' -- the number of 45- to 64-year-olds working or actively seeking work -- has remained unchanged. In contrast, every other age group has shown a decline.   ''Older workers don't have the choice of withdrawing from the labor force,'' said Mr. Hipple, pointing out that they have mortgages to pay, health issues and retirement to worry about, as well as children to put through college.  Tory Johnson, owner of Women for Hire, which for the last decade has run job fairs in America's 10 largest cities, has been struck by the toughness of the boomer work force. ''With the 20- and 30-somethings, the attitude is, 'No one is hiring, what's the point of going to a job fair?' '' Ms. Johnson said. ''With the boomers, it's, 'Even if there's one job, I'll try.' '' At her 16 job fairs so far in 2009, she said, attendance is up 10 percent over all, and it's because of boomers; every other age group has declined.  A big shift she's seen is middle-aged workers turning to temporary employment to survive. ''It may not be the ideal scenario,'' she said. ''But there's a recognition you have to do what it takes, and it could lead to a full-time job.''  Indeed, a growth in temporary work is one of the very few hopeful employment signs at this moment. When Keith Hall, the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, recently announced the 10.2 percent jobless rate for October, he noted only two sectors had shown growth: health care, with 29,000 new jobs, and temporary workers with 34,000.   Boomer-age workers are the only age group whose employment prospects have improved since last summer. For people over 45, joblessness was 6.8 percent in October, down from 7.3 percent in July (the highest for this age group since data was first collected 60 years ago). In contrast, for 25- to 34-year-olds, joblessness was 10.8 percent in October, up from 10 percent in July; for those 35 to 44, it was 8.5 percent in October, up from 7.9 in July.  Thomas Lawrence, a vice president for Kelly Services based in New York City, has seen a growth in the number of skilled boomers like Joseph Paccione, 55, applying for temporary jobs. Mr. Paccione, a computer specialist from Queens, had spent 30 years working for two companies. But over a year ago he was laid off from his $60,000-a-year job at Lockheed Martin, where he was a technology specialist for 200 workers in 7 states. After having no luck finding anything full time, in September he took a seven-week assignment through Kelly, filling out spreadsheets for a Long Island firm. He made $17 an hour and said it was grunt work compared with his previous job.  After a few days on the job, he said, he used his computer knowledge to reduce the time it took him and his three temporary co-workers to finish each report, to 30 minutes from two hours. He also taught his supervisor, so she could do it herself after he left. She was grateful, and offered to write a recommendation, but his hope that the job would extend beyond Oct. 30 was not realized. His wife of 27 years, his 26-year-old daughter with a master's degree in biology, his 24-year-old videographer son with a bachelor's degree from St. John's, are all working part time. His youngest is at Queens College, and not one of them has health insurance.  ''It's scary,'' Mr. Paccione said. He turned down a recent job possibility from Kelly that paid $12 an hour as too low and is continuing to look. ''I have to get better at doing job searches,'' he said. ''I don't know, maybe I'm not looking in the right places.''  Steven Berchem, vice president of the American Staffing Association, a trade group comprising  temporary-help companies like Kelly, said studies have shown that during a ***recession**, the first harbinger of employment recovery is growth of temporary jobs. That began in late July and has improved a little each month, with the addition of 3,000 temporary jobs in August, 7,000 in September and then the 34,000 last month. ''Typically, six months later you start to see improvement in general employment,'' Mr. Berchem said.  The hope is that employers make those temporary jobs permanent. Mr. Lawrence of Kelly said that in the last several weeks, for the first time in over a year he's hearing employers say, ''I have a position to fill with potential to hire full time.''  This is what John Cullum, 44, is hoping for. Mr. Cullum, who has a master's degree in French, worked as an executive assistant in investment banking for Cowen and Company in Manhattan for six years, earning $65,000, until he was laid off in April. After months of looking, he found a temporary job in September through Kelly, working for an engineering group in Westchester County, making $25 an hour. Though his wife has a job as a human resources director, they've had to renegotiate their debt with their credit card companies.  ''You're hoping the employer will see your value and task you to be a full-time employee in the future,'' said Mr. Cullum, who has two children. Every few weeks, he calls the Kelly office in White Plains that placed him, just to stay in touch. ''You want to keep your name out there in case you have to start over again,'' he said.  Wanda Matthews, 53, of Houston, an administrative assistant laid off in December 2008, took two short temporary jobs over the next six months that she hoped would lead to something better, but did not. ''I was just doing what I could to stay busy,'' said Ms. Matthews, who's been working since she was 16. ''You want to stay in the work force.''  Then, last summer, she got a temporary position with a large international energy corporation. She began working three days a week, went to five, and in mid-September was promised a permanent job to start in a few weeks. ''Oh, my gosh, I was so excited,'' she said, ''but you don't want to get overly excited, you don't want to say too much until you've got it, until you go to that hiring table and you go through onboarding.''   At her age, Ms. Matthews has learned the hard way about not counting her chickens. But on Oct. 1, right on schedule, she was onboarded, crossing from temporary to the promised land that Mr. Paccione and Mr. Cullum and so many Americans lie awake nights hoping for: an honest-to-goodness, full-time, permanent job.

247,4T6N-D190-TX12-N1H5-00000-00.txt,"c(""Aug. 13--A new threat is emerging that could keep the tidal wave of foreclosures continuing into 2011, experts say.More interest-only and so-called option adjustable-rate mortgages handed out during the real-estate boom -- loans considered a step up from subprime that were intended for borrowers with higher credit scores -- are starting to go bad as home values continue to fall. These loans also are called alternative-documentation loans, or Alt-A.Subprime loans, often with adjustable rates, blew the bottom out of home prices beginning last year and sent a flood of bank-owned homes on to the real estate market after many borrowers found they couldn't keep up with escalating payments.The same thing could happen with Alt-A loans, many of which will \""recast\"" -- or adjust upward -- beginning next year. Defaults are expected on interest-only mortgages because the borrower pays only interest for a period of time, usually five or seven years. Then the remaining balance must be paid over a shorter term, which increases the monthly payment -- especially if the loan features an adjustable rate.Because the loans were selling like hotcakes in the early part of the decade, many are coming due in the near future, experts say.The loans were popular in the central San Joaquin Valley as housing prices soared during the real-estate boom. Borrowers expected to refinance before their payments increased. Instead, home values fell, borrowers owed more than their houses were worth, and new loans weren't possible.\""I got caught with my pants down on quite a few,\"" said Richard Barnes, owner of Resource Lenders of Fresno, who issued those types of loans.Alt-A loans will begin recasting this year, said Paul Leonard, director of the California office of the Center for Responsible Lending, which works to eliminate predatory lending practices. The adjustments are expected to continue at a high level through 2010 and then begin to decline, he said.The result is likely to be more homes pushed on to the market through foreclosure, said Sean O'Toole, president of ForeclosureRadar, an online tracking service.Whether another wave of defaults would continue to send values down remains to be seen, he said.Prices likely won't increase if supply vastly surpasses demand, but they will only fall so far before hitting a natural bottom, he said. California's growth rate, rental rates, construction costs and income levels help determine that level, and O'Toole said he thinks some communities, such as Stockton, which leads the nation in foreclosures, might already be near the bottom.Don Scordino, president of the Fresno Association of Realtors, said real estate agents are seeing more activity as lower prices draw people into the market. His association doesn't track Alt-A loans, but he said most agents think that the market is experiencing the worst of the foreclosure crisis now.During the most recent quarter, foreclosures made up 43.2% of all sales in Fresno County, up from 6.3% five years ago, according to Zillow.com, an online service. The median home price of $204,000 is off 22% from last year, according to Zillow.com, and about 80% of all homeowners who bought in 2006 are under water.The California-based bank IndyMac and other Alt-A lenders already are experiencing large losses. Freddie Mac, which purchases mortgages from other financial institutions, is reeling from the loans. They make up 10% of Freddie's portfolio but accounted for more than half of the company's credit losses in the second quarter of this year.How many borrowers will wind up losing their homes remains to be seen. Last quarter, only 25% of borrowers in California who defaulted on their mortgage escaped foreclosure, down from 80% in summer 2006.But new legislation and increased willingness by banks to work with borrowers could help.\""We do see modest increases in [loan] modifications occurring, which I think is stunning,\"" Leonard said. \""But it is not keeping pace with foreclosures and defaults.\""Last quarter, there were 120,000 more foreclosures than modifications in California, the Center for Responsible Lending said.O'Toole of ForeclosureRadar.com said the problem is too big to bail out. He said he thinks the government measures mostly postpone the inevitable.But he also issued an encouraging message. Falling prices are sparking an increase in home sales, which is a first step toward recovery.The population in California continues to grow, the cost of building a house is increasing and housing prices won't fall below a certain level, O'Toole said.Prices aren't likely to increase for at least two years, he said, but eventually they will.\""Time will fix everything,\"" O'Toole said. \""The real question is when, and that is what we don't know.\""The reporter can be reached at snax@fresnobee.comor (559) 441-6495.To see more of The Fresno Bee, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.fresnobee.com Copyright (c) 2008, The Fresno Bee, Calif.

248,4TPX-BR50-TWHW-6094-00000-00.txt,"   Here's a free piece of advice to President Barack Obama or President John McCain: There's no need to look for a new secretary of defense. You already have the best man in the job.The Obama campaign in particular seems to have noticed the virtues of Defense Secretary Robert Gates. It's a little head-spinning to see senior Democrats lauding a Bush Cabinet officer in the heat of the campaign, but earlier this month, Richard Danzig, the former Navy secretary who has become one of Obama's closest national security aides, said that many of Gates' pragmatic policies at the Pentagon ""are things that Sen. Obama agrees with and I agree with.""The case for Gates goes beyond the obvious question of assisting the next president in handling Iraq, which Gates has helped haul back from the brink of total collapse. He has also been instrumental in launching a sweeping revolution in U.S. national security.Gates has found space to do so since, with the exception of Vice President Dick Cheney, the hard-liners who populated the first Bush term are gone. Even Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who played cheerleader to the addled muscle-flexing policies of the first term, has surrounded herself with career diplomats and is actually listening to them. The administration that didn't do nation-building and wouldn't talk to the ""axis of evil"" is doing both.The most important change, however, is that the administration has finally hit on a long-term way to make the United States secure: by promoting prosperity abroad. This doesn't sound like Pentagon business, but Gates has shown a surprising willingness to think creatively. He doesn't get the attention that his abrasive predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, did, but Gates has put forward a national security policy vision that will be far more lasting -- and successful.Gates has argued that, as he put it on Sept. 29 at the National Defense University, ""direct military force will continue to have a role"" in the ""prolonged, worldwide irregular campaign"" against al-Qaida and other violent extremists. But here's the important part: Gates understands ""that over the long term, we cannot kill or capture our way to victory.""Instead, he calls for beefed-up U.S. diplomatic and development capabilities. Unlike Cheney and Rumsfeld, who were obsessed with potential great-power competitors such as China, Gates bluntly admits that the ""most likely catastrophic threats to our homeland -- for example, an American city poisoned or reduced to rubble by a terrorist attack -- are more likely to emanate from failing states than from aggressor states."" His solution to failing states? Help patch them up. Gates argued that the lesson from Iraq and Afghanistan is that ""economic development ... good governance, providing basic services to the people, training and equipping indigenous military and police forces, strategic communications, and more -- these, along with security, are essential ingredients for long-term success.""Another sign of this revolution came last week with the release of a new Army field manual whose sections on conflict-ridden, fragile states give similar weight to both nation-building and major combat operations. Gates sees reconstruction and economic development as central parts of the Pentagon's push to make the United States safer from the threats that can lurk inside weak and failing states such as Afghanistan.He has been quietly putting this approach into action. In a little-noticed move last summer, the Pentagon sent the USS Kearsarge, an amphibious assault ship, on a humanitarian mission to six countries in Latin America. Instead of rushing Marines into battle, the Kearsarge carried more than 500 humanitarian workers, doctors and development experts -- all with the mission, in the words of the ship's commander, of ""influencing generations to come."" When Hurricane Ike slammed into Haiti in September, the Kearsarge took helicopters and boats to the desperate island nation.The Kearsarge mission shrewdly sought to build on perhaps the best foreign policy moments of Bush's two terms: the responses to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2005 earthquake in Pakistan. The United States used its might to address pressing humanitarian crises -- and in doing so, built up much-needed trust.In a world in which the United States has endured double-digit declines in its popularity since 2002, such efforts can restore U.S. credibility -- the key missing ingredient for winning the war on terror. This new focus on building a more prosperous, less menacing world works: It delivers tangible results, makes our friends abroad more stable and offers a far more reliable path to keeping the United States safe. It also happens to represent a revolutionary shift in Bush administration thinking about security. And it is being driven by military and Foreign Service officers with no ideological agendas -- including Adm. Michael Mullen, Gen. David Petraeus and State Department officials Christopher Hill, William Burns and David Welch.The professionals understand that any deal that might persuade North Korea or Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions must also help those regimes feed their people and feel more secure. They understand that if we want the world to help us fight nuclear proliferation and terrorism, we have to be seen as helping the rest of the world's citizens with their own challenges.The gap between these two approaches -- between the professionals and the ideologues -- is perhaps starkest on Iraq. Our generals know that the secret of the ""surge"" wasn't simply putting more U.S. troops on the ground as our coalition partners withdrew. The secret was implementing a new set of tactics, largely drawn from the counterinsurgency manual developed by Petraeus, that focused on the Iraqi people's basic needs.During his 2003 stint as commander of the 101st Airborne Division in Mosul, Iraq, he recognized that security depended not only on killing insurgents but also on making sure that the Iraqis had a chance to improve their quality of life. Petraeus kept asking, ""Is life better than it was under Saddam Hussein?"" He made great strides in improving the security situation by bettering Iraqis' lives with quick, high-impact construction projects, by employing Iraqis rather than foreign contractors to help build their own country and even jump-starting trade between northern Iraq and Syria.It's this sort of broad-mindedness that we need -- and that Gates values. The Pentagon chief likes to quote Gen. George Marshall's description of Dwight Eisenhower as the ""almost perfect model of a modern commander: part soldier, part diplomat, part administrator."" Gates understands that all three aspects are crucial, that for all our core national security problems -- finishing the jobs in Iraq and Afghanistan, stabilizing Pakistan, defeating al-Qaida, confronting a resurgent Russia and advancing the Middle East peace process -- the secret to success will be giving people in the area more comfortable, hopeful lives. If McCain and Obama understand this as well, they'll ask Gates to stay put. He has served his country well, but his country isn't done with him yet.

The majority of that money, $35,000, will be used for basic needs, utility and rent assistance. The other $5,000 will go toward providing Thanksgiving baskets to 100 families.\""What we're finding out is there has big need for assistance (with food baskets) this year,\"" Aragon said. \""We've contacted those agencies that typically provide food baskets and they're at capacity.\""Tom &amp; Louie's Cupboard has provided some 500 food baskets and Catholic Charities has contributed to another 130 baskets, and there is still a need, Aragon said.\""There is a big need this year and El Pomar has recognized that need.

We are helping two to five new households per day,\"" she said.\""The new demographics seem to be the working poor who cannot stretch their food budget and nontraditional college students with families,\"" Reynolds said. \""We are also seeing an increase in single-parent homes, specifically teenagers, as well as senior citizens.\""Without El Pomar's contribution this year, Aragon said there would be many more Puebloans who would be going without basic needs this holiday season.\""This time of year is always bad because of the holidays and the weather, but I think this year, it's worse than in the past,\"" she said. \""We've seen an increase in need since the summer. Without El Pomar's generosity, I think people would be having a pretty empty Thanksgiving and holiday season.\""In addition to the grants made to the six Pueblo nonprofits, Pueblo County also will benefit from a Colorado Assistance Fund grant of $220,000 awarded to Colorado Springs-based Care and Share Food Bank.

250,7X9R-2P00-Y8Y9-X00X-00000-00.txt,"Vista has started a homegrown economic stimulus program that provides a little extra spending money to customers who patronize local businesses during this tough ***recession**.Beginning today, the city will provide $30 Visa gift cards to shoppers who spend $300 or more at local retailers. Shoppers can bring a maximum of 10 receipts to City Hall to claim their cards; there is a limit of one card per household.The city has bought hundreds of the cards, with the goal of helping struggling businesses increase sales. The cards are restricted electronically so they can be used only in Vista, which in turn benefits the city with additional tax revenue. Much of the city’s budget comes from local sales tax, money that provides for public safety, parks and other services.Vista began offering gift cards in July for big-ticket purchases, and that program is continuing. It provides $200 gift cards to those who purchase new automobiles or make one-time purchases of $20,000 at Vista stores. Since the program began, 66 people have redeemed receipts for the $200 gift cards.Both gift-card programs — part of the city’s ShopVISTA campaign — end Dec. 31.Economic Development Director Kevin Ham said the gift cards are a one-time promotion to boost business in collaboration with the Vista Village Business Association and the Vista Chamber of Commerce.Vista spent $60,500 on the gift cards, purchasing 250 of the $200 cards and 350 of the $30 cards, along with minor card processing costs, Ham said. The money came from the general fund. All gift cards are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis while they last.It’s unclear whether the city might recoup the expense in additional sales tax. Ham said he plans to follow up with business owners to see if the program stimulated sales.“It’s not a large program,” said Vista Mayor Morris Vance, “but I think that it shows that we have a desire to have people come shop Vista.”The program comes as many cities are seeking to boost business through “shop locally” programs and discounts. Vista’s program is unique because it provides money directly to customers. Palmdale and Lancaster have similar gift-card programs, Ham said.Vista has created a Web site, ShopVista.biz, that details the gift-card program and other city efforts to help developers and businesses boost revenues and create jobs. Among a long list of programs, the city offers fast-tracking of certain construction projects and a free career center for residents.Dan Villaseñor, owner of the Pepper Tree Frosty hamburger and ice cream stand on South Santa Fe Avenue, said the card idea is a great incentive for people to stay close to home.“A lot of times during the holidays people spend that money anyway,” he said.Villaseñor is offering additional discounts for people using the cards, such as buy-one, get-one-free burritos. The regular price for a carne asada burrito with guacamole and salsa is $3.75.“We’ve been in this rough economy, but people still enjoy going out to dinner,” Villaseñor said. “They know my prices are reasonable so they come in as families.”Kent Shuman, whose family owns Embroidery Image on South Citrus Avenue, said he hopes the cards inspire people to buy more custom embroidery on bamboo-fiber sheets and clothing, hats and other gifts at his shop. “Anything that can help offset the current economic times, I think, is a good idea,” he said.Shuman is offering free digitizing of a logo or design, a $120 value, for customers who spend their city gift card in his shop. Vista Village Business Association Executive Director Janet Puckett said she is excited about the program. “We’re a very tight community, and by working together, the whole city succeeds,” she said. Chamber of Commerce interim CEO Bret Schanzenbach said businesses appreciate the city’s effort.“They care — they’re doing what they can,” Schanzenbach said. “That matters when I look to keep my lease here in Vista or move somewhere else.For gift card guidelines, shoppers can go to ShopVista.biz, or call the ShopVISTA hot line at (760) 726-1340 ext. 1305.Tanya Mannes: (760) 476-8243; tanya.mannes@uniontrib.com",1,,,

So has playing make-believe.Begun by Barrango's great grandfather, Salvatore, the business strongly remains \""family-oriented,\"" the 28-year-old said. \""It's way cool. Not a lot of peoplecan say they work with their family and like it.\""The Barrangos are involved in the company from the factory to the central office.Barrango's mother, Pamela, is a designer and co-event coordinator while his father, John, is the senior vice president of sales.His brother is an artist and sculptor while an uncle serves as the factory president. Another relative is a construction worker in the factory.The company employs about 30 people -- 50 during the Christmas season.Pamela likes seeing her son and younger family members helping carry on the business.\""It's been pretty wonderful to see new members of the family come into the business and enjoy it,\"" she said, crediting the next generation with bringing in fresh ideas to tackle a changing market.\""It's wonderful to see the progress we've made,\"" she added.For most of its history, the company has catered to the large commercial clientele. But because of the nation's ***economic downturn**, the Barrangos are seeking to branch out more to the general public and smaller businesses.\""Times are tough,\"" Barrango said, \""so we're trying to shift our focus.\""Part of that effort is opening up the fantasyland showroom to the community at large during the holidays and selling Christmas trees, Barrango said.Adapting to market changes is nothing new to the company.Early on, the company -- founded in San Francisco by a sculptor from Italy who restored statues of saints at churches all over the Bay Area -- made store mannequins.When fiberglass was invented around World War II, the company was among the first to use the material to develop lightweight mannequins that could be posed to better display merchandise.In the late 1960s, the use of mannequins in store-window displays declined, but the company took that in stride and began making full-scale custom seasonal decorations.It later expanded to carousel manufacturing. The company's work has included the Venetian-themed carousel at the Fashion Island mall in Newport Beach, the \""Wizard of Oz\""-themed merry-go-round at Universal Studios in Osaka, Japan, and a \""Looney Tunes\"" ride at a Warner Bros. theme park in Germany.In the 1980s, the company moved to South San Francisco.\""It's a treasure that a lot of people in South San Francisco didn't even know about,\"" said Maria Martinucci, chief executive officer for the local Chamber of Commerce.Martinucci has visited the company a few times already, she said, \""but every time you go, you notice something you didn't notice before. It's a constant surprise to me.\""The showroom in particular definitely captures the imagination, she said.\""If you can dream it up,\"" Barrango said, \""we can make it come to life one way or another.\""For more information, visit www.barrango.com.Reach Neil Gonzales at 650-348-4338.To see more of the San Mateo County Times or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.insidebayarea.com/sanmateocountytimes/.

252,7V79-54D1-2R6B-03F9-00000-00.txt,"At a time when every dollar of state revenue counts, officials are trying to track down nearly $6.6 million in delinquent taxes from more than 200 businesses in Pennsylvania.The Department of Revenue last week updated its tax-delinquent list, which shows 225 businesses that failed to pay certain taxes to the state. Each business either collected sales taxes from its customers or withholding taxes from its employees, or both.One Franklin County business is listed among the delinquent taxpayers: Knuckleheads Original Self Service Motorcycle Center of Chambersburg, which was listed for owing $19,310. Knuckleheads has a disconnected phone number and could not be reached for comment.Businesses owing the state the most are Crisman Harwood Flooring of Pottstown, which was listed for owing $175,032; New Jersey-based Sequel Solutions Plus, owing $161,265; and K&amp;D Jewelers of Bethlehem, owing $139,460.Thirty-eight businesses were added last week to the list, which is updated quarterly. The new listings include East Penn Container Decorating of Berks County, owing $94,861.While the state faces a budget crisis that developed in recent months, the list is not new. State officials created it in 2006, hoping the publicity and accompanying court action would pressure businesses into paying up.State officials file a lien against each business in county court, which essentially freezes their finances and ensures the state gets paid if the business is sold.And the state promotes the list. When the updated list was released last week, Acting Revenue Secretary Stephen Stetler encouraged people to check it out on the department's Web site at www.revenue.state.pa.us.While $6.6 million is a small fraction of the state's $28 billion budget, the delinquent taxes serve up a reminder that the state is scraping to get through this year. Gov. Ed Rendell has estimated a $2.3 billion budget shortfall this year, and has cut programs and frozen most state hiring to help cover it.State officials give delinquent businesses several chances to pay up, Revenue Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Brassell said. Revenue officials contact each business several times and also offer them a payment plan to catch up, she said. Often just the threat of being put on the list encourages business owners to pay, Brassell said. Since the list was started, delinquent businesses have paid $87 million and started payments plans for an additional $20.7 million after being threatened with the list, she said.Yet collecting from some businesses can be hard, because some go out of business.Among them is Smokey Joes Barbeque Grille in York, which closed last summer and was listed for owing $24,474. A message left at a forwarding phone number for owner Joseph Whitehead was not returned for this story.Other owners don't like to talk about their situation. A woman at B&amp;T Towing &amp; Auto in York County, which was listed for owing $16,309, hung up when contacted by phone for this story.Still others say they've fallen on hard times and need a chance to catch up. Karen Whitaker, co-owner of Lebanon's Whitaker Cleaning Systems, which was listed for owing $23,173, said the bad economy has hurt their finances.She said they want to pay their delinquent tax bill and have been trying. She said their business had been on a payment plan to stay off the list, but was unable to keep the payments this winter.The bad publicity hurts their business even more, Whitaker said.""This is just making it worse for businesses. Businesses are struggling now. I'm just mortified over this whole thing,"" she said.Brassell said revenue officials who track down the late taxes are doing a job for the benefit of all taxpayers, and businesses that pay their taxes shouldn't have to carry the burden for those that don't.""It's really a matter of tax fairness as well,"" she said.Notable tax-delinquent businessesFranklin County:Knuckleheads Original Self Service Motorcycle Center, Chambersburg, $19,310Elsewhere:Crisman Harwood Flooring, Pottstown, $175,032Sequel Solutions Plus, New Jersey, $161,265K&amp;D Jewelers, Bethlehem, $139,460View the entire list of tax-delinquent businesses at the Department of Revenue's Web site at www.revenue.state.pa.us.",0,,,

This year, he said, those seasonal jobs will be reduced to two.\""Or none,\"" Atkinson said Wednesday. \""I just haven't seen the traffic here to justify bringing additional people on. Like most businesses, we've tightened our belts. You just have to work with a leaner crew.\""Lara Brunot, supervisor of the Peebles Department Store in Meadville, said her business will hire 50 percent fewer workers this holiday season, trimming an already small seasonal staff from four to two.\""It's corporate cutbacks to save money; it's fewer hours to contain payroll. We're no different in that respect than many other places,\"" Brunot said. \""We don't want to eliminate any of our full-time or part-time jobs, or take away from the workers who have been with us for years.\""But the cutbacks won't happen everywhere. Representatives of some retail stores in the region said they would hire the same number of holiday workers this year that they did in 2008.\""I can assure you of that,\"" said Jim Cosgrove, store director at Target, 6700 Peach St. \""Based on our sales, our business is very good. And I anticipate staying good through the fourth quarter.\""Cosgrove said his Target store in 2008 hired 40 to 50 holiday workers, with their jobs ranging from working cash registers and stocking shelves to unloading delivery trucks. He expects to hire just as many people this year, such as college students on winter recess, retirees and others looking to find a way back into the work force.Part-time holiday jobs have been a staple in America's employment history. The takers included already employed people looking for supplemental income, people looking to boost the quality and quantity of their Christmas gifts, and others simply scraping to pay their bills.But in a severe ***recession**, said a local employment specialist, everything changes.\""We have an economy that is very fragile, and a lot of businesses are panicking,\"" said Chuck Campagne, president of Career Concepts Staffing Services, 4504 Peach St. Campagne has been placing people in temporary jobs for the past four decades.\""The retail industry is anticipating that consumer spending won't be generating good sales, and because of that they're going to gear down and decrease jobs,\"" Campagne said. \""I just hope we don't see too much of it here.

255,4PJW-GD10-TX12-N0MC-00000-00.txt,"c(""Sep. 2--Not so long ago, Americans created retirement nest eggs using bank savings accounts or U.S. Treasury bonds, seeking the safety of insured or guaranteed income.That security, however, was sometimes eroded as interest rates headed downward or as inflation rose. Over time, I have seen people well into their retirement years get into a bind because the cost of living continued to rise but their income declined.Inflation is a big enemy for retired people. We haven't seen superinflation since the early 1980s, but there will come a time when it returns, and you don't want that time to be when you are retired with all your investments in certificates of deposit or bonds.I recall overhearing a man complaining loudly to a bank teller. His certificate of deposit had matured at a time when interest rates were much lower than when he purchased his last CD.He angrily told the teller that, while interest rates had fallen, the cost of a loaf of bread had increased.At some point, when retirees are least able to do anything about it, expenses might climb higher than their income. Invariably, they will then take on more risk to try to get a higher return.Retirement, though, is no time to be increasing your risk because you have little or no time to recoup losses.The more income retirees take from their investments, the less growth they will experience. The more their investments are focused on growth, the less income they generate.As Americans are living longer, their retirement nest eggs need to supply both income and growth. You may see a round of sharp inflation, a ***recession** or two, changes in tax laws and more. You need to have an \""all weather\"" portfolio, one that can withstand the cycles.If you can handle the swings in the stock or real estate markets, consider keeping some portion of your portfolio in growth investments even after you retire.Be conservative.If you've been earning a 7 percent average annual return, then set up your account to send you a monthly check that equals a little less -- maybe 5 percent or 6 percent. If you are taking a little less than the annualized average, you will see the account grow while you take a steady income.You must be able to handle those years when the value of your account declines. You must have the constitution to trust the long-term historical return of your investments.To see more of The Sacramento Bee, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.sacbee.com/.

The company plans to consolidate its two branches in Burlington and Graham into one branch in each town.\""There just isn't enough business growth there\"" to justify two branches, Chief Financial Officer Mike Moore said.But Capital Bank is opening new branches in West Cary and Holly Springs -- targeted to open in August and September, respectively -- so it will continue to have 32 branches in all. Those two locations offer more \""growth opportunity,\"" Moore said.In the second quarter, a higher provision for loan losses and increased expenses, including a $998,000 increase in payments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., led to the lower profits. The FDIC is charging higher insurance premiums and recently levied a special assessment against all banks to shore up its insurance fund, which has been depleted by a wave of bank failures.On the plus side, the bank's net interest margin -- a measure of its profitability on loans and investments -- improved in the quarter compared to a year ago thanks to lower interest rates paid on deposits and higher loan rates.\""We remain cautiously optimistic that an improved net interest margin will have a positive impact on future earnings,\"" Yarber said in a prepared statement.The bank's provision for loan losses nearly doubled to $1.7 million because of an expanded loan portfolio and weak real estate markets.Capital Bank's stock, which has lost a third of its value in the past year, rose 58 cents Tuesday to close at $5.57.david.ranii@newsobserver.com or 919-829-4877To see more of The News &amp; Observer, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.newsobserver.com.

257,7VR0-4SP1-2PFH-504K-00000-00.txt,"TV executives are bracing for pricing battles with advertisers in what is expected to be a drawn-out ad-sales market season this year.  The annual ""upfront"" season starts in earnest today, when the big broadcast networks - ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox - unveil their new schedules. Most cable networks have already presented their shows to advertisers. (News Corp.owns Fox and The Post.)  Given the abysmal ad market and the broader ***economic downturn**, advertisers and their media buyers want to hold firm against primetime rate hikes after years of agreeing to increases.  ""The focus is really on price this year,"" said one ad buyer, who declined to be named because of the sensitive nature of the negotiations.  The broadcast networks, in particular, are feeling the heat. Despite continually eroding ratings, they have managed to pass through increases most years. Demand for broadcast time has propped up prices even as the supply of ratings dwindles.  The cable networks are better positioned heading into the upfront as they continue to close the ratings gap with their broadcast rivals and improve the quality of their shows. Even so, they are expecting some pushback from advertisers, too.  ""Everybody is going to be facing real price pressure,"" said Mel Berning, executive vice president of A&amp;E Television Networks, which owns the A&amp;E and History channels. ""What's going on in the economy is too big for anyone to get a pass.""  As the name suggests, the upfront takes place months before the networks debut their shows. A lot can happen in that time, including an uptick in the economy. In recent weeks, media chiefs have started to sound upbeat, believing the ad market is at or near the bottom.  This has given analysts a reason to be more bullish on the broadcast TV biz. If the networks don't like the pricing during the upfront, they can hold back more inventory to sell later on the spot market, betting that the economy rebounds.  The upfront haul for broadcasters - which has hovered around $9 billion for the broadcast networks the last couple of years - is expected to be down anywhere from 5 percent to 25 percent, depending on estimates.  Barclays analyst Anthony DiClemente expects broadcast upfront dollars to be down 15 percent this year as the networks hold back inventory, but he believes pricing will be stable.  ""I think that if the economy improves, the broadcast networks will make that up at least partially in the scatter market,"" he said during a conference call to discuss his upgrade of several media stocks. ""Although volume will be down year over year, I do believe that pricing will hold in at least flat versus last year's upfront.""   ---- Trip the light  Broadcast networks are tip-toeing around the current upfront season. Analysts see a real song and dance over price increases between networks and ad buyers. 2008: $9 BILLION  2009: $7.2 BILLION*  *Based on anticipated 20 percent decline in upfront sales  ",1,,,

His day began at 6 a.m. -- he won't get home until 9:30 p.m.The caffeine-aided inten- sity is a hallmark of Hallman, whose image has become ubiquitous on signs and cable TV commercials as he wages a strong campaign for a second term as mayor.He plans to spend $100,000.The campaign is equally overcaffeinated.He's the only candidate aside from Derek Lull, a 17-year-old high school student who is a write-in.Hallman's supporters say he's unopposed simply because he's done a good job.Others say opponents could have been scared off by his energy and drive -- which critics say can become needlessly intense.Hallman says some of the criticism is the result of him tackling sensitive issues and sacred cows.\""I'm obviously not the lowest-key person in the universe, and I'm always willing to engage in issues even when they're contentious,\"" he said. \""That is not typical in the political arena.\""Hallman is running during what many consider good times for Tempe. Four years ago, the city faced budget deficits and laid off employees during an economic slump.The city now runs surpluses, though they're projected to evaporate in the current downturn. Billions worth of development are under way or proposed downtown and along Tempe Town Lake.Hallman argued the city's past problems were largely because of bad policy. The city had given too many incentives to encourage development downtown or along Tempe Town Lake, he says. A favorite example of his: Tempe was prepared to give $70 million in incentives for a Peabody Hotel on the lake in the late 1990s.The deal died when Peabody couldn't get financing. The city recently sold the site for $42.5 million -- proof, Hallman said, that the city needlessly gave away millions to developers that would have built anyway.Hallman criticized the city for relying too much on restaurants and bars for downtown's success, saying a broader mix of development was needed to survive ***economic slowdown**s and boost tax revenue.In his term, downtown has seen a flood of plans for hotels, condos, offices and shops.But some Hallman critics say the mayor and city council members take too much credit for development.The high-end condos, offices and hotels are rising in Tempe because of sprawl, Arizona State University, the Metro light-rail line and the city's proximity to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, said Dan Durrenberger, a Tempe political consultant who's followed city issues for decades.\""They are not the result of any initiatives taken by the Tempe City Council,\"" Durrenberger said. \""They are purely the result of desirable market conditions.\""Barbara Sherman, a Hallman supporter and former councilwoman, acknowledges that Tempe would be successful with another mayor. But she said Hallman's sharp negotiation skills have led developers to provide amenities or funds to city projects that they wouldn't otherwise give.\""Hugh and I share a very fundamental feeling about government. ... It has to be extremely responsible with other people's money,\"" Sherman said.Hallman gives up many perks of elected office.When he entered Diablo Stadium to throw the first pitch, he knew a spread of free food awaited him in a skybox for city officials.Instead, he stopped at a stand for a $5 hot dog. In the upper level, he plunked down $2 for a coffee. He typically refuses free food or sends a check to the city or event organizer afterward.He gave up his parking space at City Hall. The night he was sworn in, he took down the reserved parking sign and reposted it at his house. He has also turned down a car allowance and cost-of-living raises to his salary, $45,653.At the same time, Hallman significantly scaled back his income.He works 50 to 55 hours a week as mayor, often getting up at 4 a.m. to also squeeze in the duties of husband, father of three and lawyer.He closed his law office late last year and turned away most of his clients to focus on the lower-paying elected post. He handles just a few clients now from his house.Hallman became mayor in 2004, replacing outgoing Mayor Neil Giuliano after one of the most bitter elections in city history. Hallman faced longtime Councilman Dennis Cahill, who won the backing of Tempe's political establishment.Cahill supporters said Hallman was too much of a maverick and too abrasive during the four years he had been a councilman.He was intensely critical of what the establishment rallied around -- light rail, subsidies for downtown redevelopment and the financial details of building Tempe Town Lake.Though Hallman was born in Tempe, he was branded an outsider.Even those who agreed with him politically opposed him because of his reputation.\""Acerbic, abrasive, grating -- pick the adjective,\"" said Monti's La Casa Vieja owner Michael Monti, who backed Cahill.Monti now supports Hallman. The new mayor reached out to Monti after the election and tried to smooth things over, Monti said.\""Most of us go through life pretty much being who we are, but I get the impression that during the last four years, Hugh has constantly analyzed himself and tweaked his software,\"" Monti said. \""A couple years ago we had Hugh 4.0, and now we have Hugh 5.7.\""But Durrenberger said Hallman remains too combative and gets too immersed in details that are the job of city officials, not the mayor.Giuliano said Hallman's negative campaign against Cahill probably kept opponents from challenging him. But he acknowledged that previous mayors have rarely faced legitimate challengers.\""I never had a serious opponent after my first election for mayor,\"" Giuliano said in an e-mail. \""The same seems to be true for the current mayor and it probably is a reflection of how Tempeans approach issues like electing a mayor.\""Hallman said he'd let others speculate why nobody is challenging him, but he acknowledged he's an intense campaigner.\""I may not be the smartest person in the world,\"" he said, \""but nobody's going to outwork me, no matter what I put myself to.\""Even supporters say Hallman's style can unnerve people.\""He is so smart and so intense that often people are intimidated by him and he works harder than most people, too,\"" Sherman said.Hallman said he had to play the maverick role on the council because he spoke to issues the establishment wouldn't discuss.A lawyer who handles contract negotiations, Hallman said he's used similar skills to reach compromises now that he's mayor.\""It's the same Hugh Hallman,\"" he said. \""I just get to use different elements of approach to achieve a different kind of result.\""Hugh Hallman Age: 46 Wife: Susan M.

260,4TN0-2FG0-TW8F-G187-00000-00.txt,"Credit markets are paralyzed, banks worldwide are being nationalized, even Beverly Hills mansions are in foreclosure, and fashion gurus are declaring ''frugality chic'' the new conspicuous consumption.   Wealth, at the moment, is either at risk or suspect. So this may not be the most propitious time to celebrate shoppers who describe Christian Louboutin boots as ''only $1,200'' and women who want birthday cakes in the shape of Louis Vuitton handbags. Yet two of television's most unabashed paeans to vulgar wealth and compulsive spending are back: ''The Starter Wife,'' a new USA series starring Debra Messing as a fictional housewife of Hollywood (based on the hit 2007 mini-series), and the Bravo reality show ''The Real Housewives of Atlanta,'' the third installment of a franchise that began with ''The Real Housewives of Orange County.''  One is make-believe, the other traffics in you-must-be-joking disbelief. But both shows are comedies that mix satire and giddy consumer voyeurism. ''The Starter Wife'' may have the trickiest path to navigate, since it asks viewers to laugh with, not at, a woman who is rich, just not rich enough. The mini-series chronicled the fall from grace of a discarded Hollywood wife, Molly Kagan (Ms. Messing), and focused on the slights and humiliations. (She loses her gym membership and her spot in the A-List ''Mommy and Me'' class).   Now, Molly is divorced and preoccupied with reviving her career, or as she puts it, ''making ends meet.'' She joins a writing class, but when she shows her tell-all diary to her handsome writing instructor, Zach McNeill (Hart Bochner), it ends up in the hands of a gossip Web site, and the unsavory secrets of her closest former friends spill out all over Hollywood.   Molly's social predicaments are amusing, but her financial tribulations -- she has to forgo the $1,200 boots; she donates time instead of money to fund-raisers for her daughter's private school -- may ring a little hollow, since California has community property divorce laws. For some reason, Molly's sense of deprivation and economic sacrifice is not part of the joke; instead, viewers are supposed to take her misfortunes at face value.   Ms. Messing has the appeal and comedic skills to make Molly likable, despite the writers' profligate piling on of virtue. (She's a perfect mother and loyal friend and even comes to the aid of her cad ex-husband when his film looks like a flop.)   The show floats mostly on lighthearted mockery of Hollywood, with lots of knowing references to movies and movie stars. Molly describes one film actor as ''Wesley Snipes on steroids, minus the tax evasion.'' As she is examining the stiletto-heeled Louboutin boots, her sardonic best friend, Joan (Judy Davis), says, ''Suri Cruise has a pair of these.'' The shopping scenes look out-of-date and a touch pathetic, but celebrity gossip is ***recession**-proof.  Shopping is the main occupation of all five heroines of ''Real Housewives,'' and it seems that Atlanta has plenty of Louis Vuitton and Versace to go around -- though for a very special occasion, the fashion stylist has a Zac Posen purse flown in from New York.   Their houses are vast, their closets brimming, and much of the day is spent giving orders to the staff, or, in the case of DeShawn Snow, whose husband plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers, instructing her estate manager on what orders to give the staff.  The Atlanta housewives are all friends, but not always friendly. They have everything, but their lives and even their vast living rooms seem strangely empty. The show has proven appeal, and it lies in the clash between these women's vanity and their all-too-obvious vulnerabilities.   This season, the setting has shifted to Atlanta and its new guard, the black elite: three of the five housewives are African-American; one is part Asian, part black; and Kim Zolciak, a busty blonde who boasts a sugar daddy boyfriend identified only as Big Poppa, describes herself as ''a black woman trapped in a white woman's body.'' (In the first episode she straps her struggling physique into a brand-new $68,000 Cadillac Escalade paid for by Big Poppa.)  Sheree Whitfield is the designated mean girl of the group, a socialite and divorcee who says her goal is to ''maintain the same lifestyle, if not better.'' She throws herself a lavish birthday party (including the Vuitton birthday cake) and somehow leaves one of her friends off of the guest list, unleashing the kind of anger, hurt feelings and social realignments that are the other driving force behind this kind of reality show, besides shopping.  Some of the husbands are professional athletes in the twilight of their careers, and at least one is a real estate developer, which brings a ''Last Days of Pompeii'' poignancy to all the frivolity and excess.  Filmed before the ***mortgage crisis** erupted, ''The Real Housewives of Atlanta'' may turn out to be the best choice for a time capsule of the Bling Decade. The wealth of these real housewives was never all that enviable, and now it looks as if it might not be viable.",0,,,

Party leaders have been pressed to show that they care about the countryside, where prices for agricultural products have been falling and where residents are feeling a widening gap between urban and rural incomes that has reached the equivalent of $1,620, $200 more than in 2007.Demonstrations have broken out across the country recently as citizens protest the lack of compensation after factory closings or following illegal land grabs. There have also been protests about the construction of polluting factories near villages and farmland, corrupt local officials who try to cover up their misdeeds, and illegal investment schemes that officials have failed to shut down.""If mass incidents happen, all officials must go to the front line and try to persuade people face-to-face,"" Chen said. ""They cannot hide and push police to the front lines. The police cannot be deployed unless there are truly unfortunate situations where people are beating, attacking, robbing or burning.""After any incident, officials must draw lessons from the conflict, punish those responsible and make new plans to improve their work, Chen said.There are now nearly 20 million unemployed migrant workers, or 15.3 percent of the total 130 million migrant worker population, Chen said. They are competing with  the 6 million who enter the migrant worker job market each year, according to figures from a Ministry of Agriculture survey of 150 villages in 15 provinces conducted before the Lunar New Year last week, when most migrant workers return home from cities for the holiday.Over the past 20 years, farmers have used outside income to supplement their farming income, making as much as 50 to 60 percent of their total pay. But for many farmers ""that road is blocked this year,"" said Xu Yong, director of the Center for Chinese Rural Studies at Central China Normal University. ""There is a saying in the countryside that to feed the mouth depends on farming but pocket money comes from outside.""Xu could not say whether protests would increase. ""During the Spring Festival, most migrant workers went home and had a rest,"" he said. ""After this, they will hunt for jobs. If they can't find any jobs but stay in the cities, it will be easy to generate conflict and instability. April and May will be the most serious time.""At least some migrant workers are taking the high unemployment rate in stride.""It's unavoidable that it will be hard to find a job this year,"" said Deng Hongshu, 43, from Daping village in Kaixian county near the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing. ""I'm prepared for spending six months or more to find a job.""Deng worked in a leather factory in Shenzhen, just north of Hong Kong, until his factory sent everyone home for a long vacation in early December.

263,7X4T-4B51-2R2Y-70VM-00000-00.txt,"c(""Nov. 19--On one level, Icap's figures this week demonstrated its resilience in the face of the global financial storm but on a deeper and more interesting level they told a different story.The evolution of the business provides clear evidence of how the structure of the over-the-counter and derivatives markets are changing before our eyes. This is not the result of regulatory or legislative changes, because politicians and regulators are still working out what should be done. Instead, rather than wait for the result of the debates, the market is moving on of its own accord. Having stared death in the face, the industry is changing to make the OTC world a safer, more resilient and efficient place. Reforms that might otherwise have taken years to negotiate are coming through in a matter of months.Icap sees money in this space, as it spelled out in the statement with its half-time figures. Most people still think of it as a voice broker, one of the biggest in the world acting as the middle man between firms seeking to buy and sell complex derivative products that are too specific to the needs of one firm or client to be easily traded on an exchange. This remains a huge business but Icap is spreading out. Its ambition now is to be the leading global intermediary and the leading post-trade services provider in these markets. It expects an even three-way split in its profits -- from voice and electronic trading and post-trade services.That is a huge shift. Five years ago, Icap was only a voice broker. Today, that business accounts for little more than half its profits. This shift has happened not because voice broking has declined but because other areas have grown: first the electronic trading platforms of BrokerTec and EBS and then -- starting last year when it bought an interest in Reset and Traiana -- the entry into post-trade services.In the wake of the crash, there has been great emphasis on measures to get more OTC products to go through clearing houses as a way to reduce counterparty risk. This is generally considered to be a good idea, though it does raise the question of whether the clearing houses will then themselves become organisations that are too big to fail. Nor will it be able to solve all the problems because not all derivatives will be suitable for clearing.But what this underlines is the need for better and more timely information, so participants can manage their risks better and this is what post-trade services provide. Essentially, it is building a post-trade information warehouse to help mitigate the back-office strains that arise from high-frequency trading; and to help firms manage their counterparty risk and net off positions with others so they can cut the use of capital.Furthermore, it sees a huge market in supplying the information it generates to the different players in the trading chain for compliance, risk management and valuation.It is a cliché to say crises present opportunities, but they do. The ability and willingness of financial firms to grab those opportunities rather than dwell on what has been lost in the crash is one very good reason to remain confident about the City as a global financial centre.FRAUD FLAW IN PAY BONANZAS: The flaws in performance pay have been catalogued here from time to time, particularly the way executives appear to fix the system so they always get a prize, and how the shift to performance pay and the vastly increased amounts paid to executives in the past 15 years seem not to have delivered any noticeable improvement in companies' long-term performance.But there is something else. Today sees the publication of the Global Economic Crime Survey, a report compiled every year by PricewaterhouseCoopers, and it not surprisingly finds that fraud and suchlike are increasing as the ***recession** tightens. That is no real surprise though. The insurance industry has long known that bad times inspire more dubious claims.What is new is the finding that firms where the top people are very heavily incentivised are more prone to fraud than those which have more equitable pay scales.One could understand -- though obviously not condone -- this if it were the top people tweaking the numbers so they hit otherwise unattainable targets, but this is not the problem.Rather, it is their underlings in the ranks of middle management who are significantly more likely to be on the take. There appears to be a cultural backlash in those organisations where a few people earn vastly more than everyone else and where because of a sense of unfairness or resentment, they feel more justified in dipping their hand in the till. The boss is helping himself to excessive amounts, so they have fewer qualms about having a little extra themselves.To see more of the Evening Standard, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.thisislondon.co.uk.

264,4V70-JS10-TWMB-P0BN-00000-00.txt,"But career counselors say the right contacts, résumé, level of enthusiasm and preparedness can get applicants hired in a flash.By LINDSAY PETERSON and ADAM EMERSONlpeterson@tampatrib.com and aemerson@tampatrib.comTAMPA - New college graduates are entering the worst job market in decades, job counselors say. But it's not hopeless - if they're smart and aggressive and use the advantages that other job seekers don't have.""There are fewer jobs and more candidates,"" said Drema Howard, the director of the University of South Florida's career center. ""But employers will still be hiring.""Last month's unemployment rate indicates how challenging it will be for recent graduates. Florida's unemployment rate rose to 7.3 percent, the highest in 15 years. In Hillsborough County, the unemployment rate rose to 7.4 percent in November, up from 4.3 percent in November 2007.Jennifer Marshall followed Howard's career counseling advice after graduating in the summer, and she managed to find the kind of job she wanted, directing child care grants at the Tampa Metro YMCA.But she had a few stumbles along the way.She left one interview thinking the job was hers, but it went to someone else. When she asked the interviewer what when wrong, she was told she wasn't enthusiastic enough about the job.In another case she neglected to update her résumé before responding to an opening and didn't even get an interview.""Those were hard lessons to learn,"" Marshall said. But she didn't repeat the errors.In this market, employers aren't going to waste their time with people who don't precisely meet their needs, Howard said.The résumé is crucial, she said. Rewrite it for each employer to show you're right for the job. ""Don't leave it to the employer to guess.""Once you get the interview, Marshall said, research the company. ""Know your stuff. Know what the job is going to be and have something to say about it.""Before her interview at the YMCA, she took some time to think about the questions her interviewers might ask, about her long-term goals, for instance, and bad job experiences in the past. ""Get your stories ready before you sit down,"" Marshall said.And dress up. ""If you want people to see you in a professional position, you have to dress that way.""Howard said job hunters should start early, before graduation.""Before graduation, you're still a student. After graduation, if you don't have a job, you're unemployed,"" she said.Also, students have access to internships, as well as university career counseling and job fairs.But employers don't always advertise open positions, said Tim Harding, the University of Tampa's career services director. So students need to network, to ""be in the right places and really market themselves.""Nathan Davison, former president of USF's student senate, doesn't graduate until next May, but he's already searching the USF job boards for positions in marketing and advertising.He has been warned that he will be competing with not only recent graduates but with experienced workers who have lost their jobs. ""I'm not going to have the same résumé as someone who's been in the field for 10 years. I'm going to have to figure out ways to shine above everybody.""Davison developed a lot of contacts in his student government job. He already has one offer to join a political campaign team after graduation, and he's considering it.""I don't want to just take a job because it's available,"" he said. ""The biggest thing I'm going to do is be very receptive, and not turn away a good opportunity.""That's the right approach, Howard said. ""Explore every option. People have a vision of what they want, but the reality is that the market is changing.""But the job picture is not completely dim, she said. Opportunities are still strong in health care. ""Accounting is still fairly stable. Engineering seems to be pretty stable. ? We're seeing a bit of a second wave in"" information technology.Also, people who are willing to move have an advantage, said Wayne Wallace, director of the career resource center at the University of Florida. ""The ***recession** is not equally painful across all 50 states.

265,4VHJ-5J80-TX2J-204S-00000-00.txt,"As the chaos off Somalia has forced more and more countries to address high-seas piracy, one nation stands out for its proven track record in the field. For years, the Strait of Malacca--a narrow but vital waterway between Malaysia and Indonesia--was bedeviled by buccaneers. Who came to the rescue? Japan, a nation not known for its willingness to take on international threats. Yet Tokyo quietly rose to the challenge, providing training to regional militaries, setting up an information-sharing center that allowed local security forces to respond quickly to attacks and providing Coast Guard ships to the ill-equipped Indonesian Navy. Japan's efforts were highly effective, helping reduce piracy incidents in the area from 150 in 2003 to a third of that just three years later.After seemingly endless dithering, politicians in Tokyo also recently agreed to dispatch warships to the Gulf of Aden--but only to protect Japanese ships and cargo, which will limit any international good will the country earns in return. And the mission will be so entangled in caveats and conditions that its effectiveness will be highly questionable.What gives? Japan, it seems, has become the Hamlet of Asia, endlessly fretting about its waning world influence while failing to do much about it. Some analysts explain the diffidence by pointing to the drawn-out ***recession** of the 1990s, which left the country demoralized and mired in debt. Others suggest that Japan's half-century military reliance on the United States created a culture of dependency and timidity. Some even blame the lack of mojo on the country's aging population, or its strikingly mediocre politicians.There's a core of truth to all these charges. Japan's government often seems to lack the will to assert itself. This reluctance is particularly problematic today, when the world is desperately looking for ways out of the ***economic crisis**. But there's reason for hope. In some cases, such as Southeast Asian piracy, Japan has already made real contributions to global problems--and hinted at a way forward on other issues. And later this year, when Japanese voters go to the polls, they're expected to deal a stinging defeat to the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed the country essentially unchallenged since World War II. If the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) forms the next government, it will face a remarkable opportunity to launch bold new initiatives--even though its current positions are a bit of a muddle. Japanese voters are likely to support decisive moves, given their frustrations with the LDP's fecklessness.If the DPJ does start tackling international problems, it will find it has plenty of resources at its disposal. The Japanese economy, for example, might not be quite the force it once was, but it's still the world's second largest. (Tokyo alone has a larger GDP than all of Canada.) Despite the global ***economic crisis**, Japanese financial institutions remain strikingly sound. ""The banking system is relatively intact,"" says former Bank of Japan official Mikio Wakatsuki. ""Our international exposure is not too bad. The currency is too strong--[but that's] another sign that we're not too badly damaged."" Wakatsuki is the first to acknowledge that these advantages are relative, and that Japan is in dire economic straits. Yet even in its weakened condition, the country has the capacity to assert benign economic leadership--should it choose to.Indeed, Tokyo has already made a few moves in the right direction. Drawing on its more than $1 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves, Japan has offered a $100 billion credit line to the International Monetary Fund, and could easily offer up to $200 billion more, says Masahiro Kawai, a Japanese director of the Asian Development Bank Institute (and not affiliated with the Japanese government). Japan has also helped strengthen economic cooperation within Asia in the past. Under strong Japanese leadership, it, along with China and South Korea, has been expanding bilateral currency swaps--financial mechanisms where countries lend foreign-exchange reserves to each other to demonstrate international confidence and deter the speculative currency attacks that plagued Asia during the ***financial crisis** in 1998.While it once led the way on such efforts, however, Tokyo has become fairly passive. Kawai says that the region urgently needs swaps on a much larger scale; so far, the three countries have pledged a total of $80 billion, but Kawai would like to see it rise to $120 billion. Japan, he says, is ideally positioned to help expand the program because of its own massive dollar reserves. The Chinese could do the same, of course, but so far they've opted to hold back--giving Tokyo a perfect opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to shoring up Asian stability.Japan could also do this by promoting Asia-wide bond markets and plans for an Asian Monetary Fund--all ideas Japan once promoted quite heavily, back in the days when it looked like the yen might become the region's dominant currency. More recently, Tokyo has let Beijing, which has shown more initiative in pursuing regional free-trade agreements, take the lead. Yet Japan could still resume its prominent role, primarily by helping Asia's economies provide financing to each other. As Wakatsuki, the former Bank of Japan official, argues, that would strengthen the world economy: ""Instead of going first to London or New York, we can invest in Asia directly using bonds.""Of course, one of the best ways Japan could boost the world's economy would be to boost its own--by implementing long-debated structural reforms to social security and taxes in order to spur domestic demand and relieve the nation's dependence on exports. It should also deregulate the agricultural sector, which could create new jobs and businesses in hard-pressed rural Japan. And Tokyo should open the Japanese economy to greater foreign investment. At the end of 2007, foreign direct investment in Japan was a paltry 3 percent of GDP, compared with 28 percent in the United States. Righting that imbalance would spur global growth at a time when it's desperately needed.To anyone who knows Japan, such grand plans might sound utopian. But skeptics can take heart from one area where Tokyo has demonstrated real leadership: the environment. Japan is a world leader in green technologies, and has spent millions helping China and other Asian states reduce their carbon emissions and clean up pollution. Tokyo is now offering a range of programs designed to help other countries tackle climate change--including one that will provide $10 billion over the next five years, mostly in low-interest loans to countries in need.Environmental leadership is easy, however, since most politicians are happy to be associated with it. The real trick will be movement on economic reform or the most sensitive issue of all: contributing more to global security, whether on piracy or the war in Afghanistan. U.S. diplomats have already signaled that the Obama administration hopes to get more help from Tokyo. But there is virtually no appetite for overseas military involvements in Japan.That doesn't mean Japan still can't contribute. As Jeff Kingston, a professor at Temple University in Tokyo, puts it, ""When they say 'boots on the ground,' it doesn't have to be military boots. It can be the boots of construction workers, teachers, health officials."" In the years to come, he says, ""nothing is going to be more important than contributing nation-building capabilities and humanitarian aid"" in Afghanistan and Pakistan. That's an area where the Japanese have already shown that they know what they're doing, in projects ranging from irrigation to health. And the payoff for doing more, in Washington and around the world, could be huge. So the only trick now is to persuade Tokyo--under its current leaders or its next ones--to take the plunge.With Akiko Kashiwagi in Tokyo",0,,,

267,7V72-9CC1-2R2Y-720T-00000-00.txt,"c(""Mar. 13--PARK RIDGE -- The Board of Education has decided to postpone a referendum on spending about $10 million to upgrade its facilities and make the district more energy efficient.Board officials cited the downturn in the economy and possible funding for solar energy projects in the recently passed federal economic stimulus package and other sources as the reasons for the postponement.\""Once we have a better sense of how the stimulus package is helping the economy and what we can secure as funding, we will determine when we go out for the referendum,\"" board President Joseph Bruno said after this week's school board meeting.The $9.96 million would fund $1.99 million in upgrades to East Brook Elementary School, $2.1 million to West Ridge Elementary School and $3.4 million to the middle and high schools, which share a building on Park Avenue.The district said it also would like to spend an estimated $2.4 million for solar panels on the roofs of the schools.Without the solar panels, residents would be asked to approve about $7.52 million to put new windows, roofs, heating and ventilation units and a boiler system at the schools, said Robert Wright, the board administrator.The voters will be responsible for about $4.5 million of that, he said. The state has committed to cover as much as 40 percent of the project's cost, he said.A portion of the solar panel costs will be offset by selling electricity back to the grid and generating what are known as Solar Renewable Energy Certificates, or SRECs, a credit earned for every 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity produced by the solar panels.The credits can then be traded or sold to power companies, which are required by law to produce a certain percentage of solar energy annually.Additionally, at least 40 percent of the eligible cost of the facilities project will be covered by the state through debt service aid, Wright said.\""There is a big push for clean energy right now,\"" Wright said. \""I know there is money in the stimulus package. I know that PSE&amp;G is trying to underwrite some of these projects... There may be other ways to put the solar panels on that might be more cost-effective.Wright added, \""I do believe that it's important that the board look at this seriously, but, at the same time, I caution them about jumping before the ink is dry, because there may be money coming down the road.\""The district can still hold a referendum in September because the state has already certified the upgrades, Wright said.The district has an enrollment of about 13,000 students.Bruno, the board president, suggested this week that this was not the best time to ask taxpayers for more money, especially when they may be facing an increase in the school portion of their tax bills.The district expects a 3.7 increase in the budget and a 4 percent increase in the tax levy, Wright said.The upgrades were necessary, he said. The single-paned glass windows were \""extraordinarily energy inefficient,\"" do not have screens and would be very expensive to retrofit, he said.\""We can't ignore the fact that we have a challenging economy,\"" Bruno said after the meeting. \""It's tough out there. We have to be considerate and respectful of that -- and we are taxpayers also, and we face the same challenges.\""To see more of The Record, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.NorthJersey.com.

268,4RSY-WTW0-TWDC-M0R3-00000-00.txt,"After San Diego County dodged the last ***recession** in 2001 -- continuing to grow as the rest of the nation went into decline -- some civic boosters boasted that the region was immune to ***recession**s, cushioned by its diverse industries, stable military presence and strong tourism business.But as the nation appears to be heading into a ***recession**, a growing number of economists fear that the county's sagging housing market and weakening employment could pull it under as well.In a forecast to be unveiled this morning at a breakfast meeting associated with the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corp., economist Christopher Thornberg said California and San Diego County are already in a ***recession**.""Unemployment is rising. Consumer spending is declining. Home prices are continuing to fall. The foreclosure rate is huge,"" said Thornberg, a co-founder of Beacon Economics in Los Angeles. ""That's why I'm not saying a ***recession** is about to happen in San Diego. I'm saying it already is happening.""Alan Gin, economist at the University of San Diego, agreed that the region has entered a ""San Diego-style ***recession**,"" meaning that job growth is lagging behind the population's growth rate. But he believes the county's diverse mix of industries will help it avoid the technical definition of a regional ***recession**: a year-to-year decline in the number of jobs and a retraction in economic growth.""It'll be very weak growth compared to what we've had, but it won't be a decline,"" Gin said.On the other hand, Gin said the housing downturn could affect consumer spending.""A key question is to what extent consumer spending was fueled by home-equity loans,"" he said. ""With those loans drying up, what will happen to retail spending?""In recent weeks, a spate of negative economic news has spurred a growing number of top economists to say that a national ***recession** is either imminent or under way. The government announced that 17,000 jobs were lost in January -- the first nationwide job loss in five years -- and the service industry reported a severe slowdown.Locally, signs of weakness have been growing over the past two months:* The median home price in San Diego County last month was 13 percent lower than it was the year before. In some neighborhoods, such as Spring Valley and southeast Chula Vista, the decline was more than 30 percent.* A record 987 houses were foreclosed upon in December, and 2,569 homeowners were notified that they were in default on their mortgages.* Bankruptcy filings jumped from 471 in January 2007 to 839 last month.* Residential building permits declined 31 percent last year, following a 29 percent drop in 2006.* Consumer confidence dropped nearly 10 percent last month, hitting its lowest point since The San Diego Union-Tribune began its surveys in April 1996. Over the past year, consumer confidence in San Diego County has dropped more than 33 percent.* The unemployment rate rose by more than a full percentage point last year, jumping from 3.7 percent in December 2006 to 4.8 percent in December 2007, its highest point in four years. The January figures will be released this month.To Thornberg, the jump in unemployment is the clearest sign that the economy has gone into a ***recession**.""The only time the unemployment rate jumps more than 1 percent in a year is when the economy is heading into a ***recession** or is already in one,"" he said.Thornberg forecast a ***recession** in both California and San Diego through autumn. The economy will struggle through the doldrums through 2009 and then begin to pick up in 2010, he said.By the time the downturn hits bottom in 2009, Thornberg said, unemployment will hit 8 percent in California and 6.4 percent in San Diego County, fueled in part by job cuts at retail stores -- as cash-strapped consumers cut back on spending -- as well as at state and local governments.In the past year, California's unemployment rate jumped from 4.8 percent to 6.1 percent.Thornberg has long been downbeat about the economy, warning about an impending housing bubble as early as 2003. But other economists share his view that the state is either on the verge of a ***recession** or has entered into one.""There's probably going to be a very mild, short ***recession** in California beginning either this quarter or next,"" said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study of the Economy in Palo Alto. ""I don't think San Diego is immune to that, partly because of the hit it's taking from home prices. Housing will turn around, but not in the next six to nine months.""Local economists, however, take issue with the idea that San Diego might fall into ***recession**.Gin said the local economy will continue to be buoyed by the tourism industry, aided by a weak dollar that will attract tourists from abroad. The military will also continue to be an engine of economic growth, he said. And an influx of venture capital money -- which could top $2 billion this year -- will help keep the area's high-tech and biotech businesses running, said Marney Cox, economist at the San Diego Association of Governments, or SANDAG.Thornberg agreed that the military and some tech sectors could remain mainstays during a ***recession**. But he said tourism -- one of San Diego's major employers -- could be vulnerable.""A lot of tourists to San Diego come from other parts of California,"" he said. ""If those people have just been foreclosed on or if they can't tap into their home-equity line for cash, they might decide they can't afford to haul their kids off to Legoland or SeaWorld.""At the depth of the last ***recession** in San Diego in the early 1990s, restaurants and entertainment spots shed more than 1,000 workers.""Tourism can soften during a ***recession** because people stop spending on things that are not vital,"" said Jack Kyser, economist with the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp.But Kyser added that even during a downturn, tourism in San Diego is buoyed by its proximity to Los Angeles. ""Even if people don't have enough money to make trips overseas, people from L.A. can zip down to San Diego and vice versa,"" he said.One thing the economists agree on is that the decline in residential real estate, which sparked the downturn, will continue.Thornberg predicted that before the decline is over, the median price of a San Diego County home will drop an additional 20 percent to below $346,000 by the end of 2010. Local economists are less dire, predicting new declines of between 5 percent to 10 percent. But Cox said those figures could change if there is a greater than expected rise of foreclosures in the market, which would drive property prices lower.[][][]San Diego ForecastsEconomists differ over the extent San Diego County will be affected by the ***economic downturn**.Alan GinUniversity of San Diego* Unemployment rate will peak at 5.5 percent this year.* 5,000 to 8,000 jobs will be created this year.* Home prices will decline from 5 percent to 10 percent this year before hitting bottom.* Roughly 7,000 residential building permits will be granted.Christopher ThornbergBeacon Economics* Unemployment rate will rise to 5.9 percent this year and peak at 6.4 percent in 2009.* 10,000 jobs will be lost by 2009.* Home prices will decline 20 percent by 2010.* Roughly 4,000 residential building permits will be granted.Marney CoxSan Diego Association of Governments* Unemployment rate will average 5.8 percent this year.* 8,000 to 10,000 jobs will be created this year.* Home prices will decline from 5 percent to 7 percent this year before hitting bottom.* Roughly 6,000 residential building permits will be granted.",1,,,
269,4TVJ-XC90-TX4W-S01J-00000-00.txt,"Mainers should expect to spend a chunk of time behind voting booth curtains on Tuesday - they'll be making a full roster of choices on elected offices, including president, U.S. senator, congressman or congresswoman, state representatives and senators and a variety of local officials.State officials expect voter turnout here to hit a record of 80 to 85 percent, largely because of the intense interest in the presidential election. And if an exciting presidential campaign weren't enough to push people to the polls, Maine has a number of referendum questions before voters that touch on high-interest issues including gambling, taxes and health care.No matter who wins, the presidential election will be historic. If Democratic Sen. Barack Obama is elected, he'd be the first black president. If Republican Sen. John McCain takes the office, he'd be the oldest man elected president, and his running mate would be the first female vice president.In the quest for voters, McCain has cast himself as a maverick, able to stand up to his own party and to work across the political aisle for the good of the country. Obama has worked to portray himself as an agent of change after eight years of a Republican president in the White House.Issues in the campaign have included energy prices and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But the country's faltering economy and the meltdown on Wall Street have emerged as the top concerns among voters across the country and in Maine.Also on the ballot in Maine are Green Party candidates Cynthia McKinney, a former Democratic Georgia congresswoman, and her running mate, Rosa Clemente, a community activist, journalist and hip-hop artist; and consumer advocate Ralph Nader and his running mate, San Francisco politician and activist Matt Gonzalez, running as independents.In Maine's U.S. Senate race, Democratic U.S.Rep. Tom Allen is challenging Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins for her seat. Both Allen, of Portland, and Collins, of Bangor, have represented Maine in Congress for 12 years.Allen has focused his campaign on the differences between him and Collins on major national issues, including the war in Iraq, energy policy and economic policy.He has tried to paint Collins as a consistent supporter of the Bush administration economic policies that he says have hurt Maine families and laid the groundwork for the Wall Street ***financial crisis**.Collins has touted her bipartisan efforts in the Senate, and has effectively distanced herself from the national Republican Party by running as an independent voice. In her campaign, she has underlined a record of constituent service and accomplishment in national intelligence, postal reform and homeland security, while attempting to portray Allen as a faithful Democrat unwilling to fight his party's leadership.The race is the most expensive political campaign in the state's history, with the candidates collecting a total of $12.6 million, according to the most recent finance reports.Allen's run for the Senate left open his seat as Maine's 1st Congressional District representative. Democrat Chellie Pingree of North Haven and Republican Charlie Summers of Scarborough have been battling to take that post. Both have previously run unsuccessfully to represent Maine in Congress. Summers lost a race against Allen in 2004, and Pingree lost her bid to unseat Collins in 2002.Pingree is a former Maine Senate majority leader and president of Common Cause, the national nonpartisan government-reform lobbying group. In the state Senate, she pushed through the Maine Rx law to lower prescription drug costs.During her campaign for the 1st District, Pingree has described the Iraq war as ''the worst foreign policy mistake in our country's history.'' She has argued for an end to the war, and sees that as an opportunity to refocus federal money and efforts on domestic problems.Summers was a state senator, and worked as U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe's state director. He was also the regional director of the Small Business Administration before serving in Iraq as a Naval Reserve officer. He's cast himself as a moderate in his campaign, promoting ideas such as making health-care costs deductible from income tax, improving the health and benefits system for veterans and pushing for oil and gas exploration in the United States.In the 2nd Congressional District, incumbent U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud, a Democrat, is fending off a challenge by Republican John Frary. Michaud, a mill worker from East Millinocket and a former state Senate leader, was first elected in 2002. Frary is a retired college professor, newspaper columnist and a former Farmington selectman.And across Maine, hopefuls are running to either win or keep seats in the Legislature. Both the Democratic and Republican parties hope for control of the House and Senate. House Democrats currently hold 90 of 151 seats. Republicans have 59 seats, and two seats belong to members who are not enrolled in either party.There are nearly 30 open seats in Maine House races this year, with no incumbents.In the state Senate, Democrats hold the slimmest of majorities, with 18 seats to the Republicans' 17. Four Democrats and two Republicans are termed out this year.Some of the most-watched campaigns, however, are the state's referendum questions.A gambling proposal is again before state voters in the form of Question 2. Las Vegas-based Olympia Gaming has proposed a casino with an attached hotel, spa, restaurants, conference space and other attractions in the town of Oxford.Built in phases, it could eventually have 1,500 slot machines, 20 gaming tables, a poker room and 300 hotel rooms.It's projected to employ 900 people, and proponents have pushed the proposal as important to help the state and regional economy.Olympia took over the casino campaign this summer, and has said that certain parts of the legislation would have to be worked on by the Legislature, if the measure is passed by voters on Nov. 4.The issues include provisions that would lower the gambling age from 21 to 19; put a 10-year moratorium on other casinos in the state, essentially giving Olympia a monopoly; and require that a representative from the casino be given a seat on the board of every state entity that receives revenue from the gambling operations.Opponents of the proposal have also said the legislation is flawed, but have suggested that voters shouldn't pass it and trust the Legislature to fix it.And Mainers will vote on Question 1, through which they'll decide whether to repeal a measure enacted by the Legislature in April to increase beverage taxes to help bolster funding for Maine's state-run Dirigo Health program.The measure also adds a new 1.8 percent tax on health insurance claims to replace an assessment on insurers.In all, opponents say the new taxes will add up to more than $78 million a year - $40.7 million on beverages and another $38 million on health insurance claims.Supporters say the taxes will add up to less than $50 million - $16.7 million in beverage taxes and $33 million on health insurance claims. They say the taxes on health insurance claims replace a previous assessment on insurance companies, and therefore don't represent ''new'' taxes.Less controversial is Question 3, a $3.4 million bond issue to support drinking water programs, support construction of wastewater treatment plants and leverage $17 million in funds.Proceeds of the sale of $1.7 million in bonds would go into an existing revolving loan fund administered by the Maine Bond Bank and distributed by the Department of Environmental Protection. Municipalities would be able to borrow money from the fund to build and upgrade sewage treatment facilities. These funds would be matched by about $8.5 million in federal funds.The remaining $1.7 million would go into the state's safe drinking water revolving loan fund, administered by the bond bank and the Department of Health and Human Services. Public water systems would apply for loans from the fund to design, build or improve drinking water supplies or treatment and distribution systems. The $1.7 million would also be matched by about $8.5 million in federal funds.Staff Writer Matt Wickenheiser can be contacted at 791-6316 or at:mwickenheiser@pressherald.com",0,,,

(I was only recently turned on to this talented emcee -- who also goes by the alias \""Don Jamar\"" -- via local composer Ryan Rapsys, who produced four tracks on this album and is promoting it through his Erratik Productions label.)In a scene dominated by labels like Definitive Jux and Minneapolis' Rhymesayers Entertainment -- and \""incorporated\"" rappers like Aesop Rock and Slug -- it's refreshing to hear artists working outside the very-connected indie scene. Not that there's anything wrong with the labels and musicians I just mentioned, but there's a reason one of last year's most exciting releases was \""Evolution of Revolution,\"" from Twin Ports hip-hop outfit Kritical Kontact: It didn't have as many built-in expectations and, for the most part, each subsequent track waiting around the corner delivered a surprise.And that's exactly what \""Pirtlean\"" is: a surprise. Not just because Pirtle is primarily regarded as a theater artist (before an oh-so-recent relocation to the Twin Cities, he was teaching the finer points of the performing arts in and around Fargo), but because it seemingly came out of nowhere and, barring a few minor missteps, it's good. Really good.The album launches with the aforementioned \""River Rat\"" and \""No Time 2 Waste,\"" a stellar pair of tracks that quickly introduce the ins and outs of Pirtle's world: Though he was raised in St. Louis, he is nothing like that city's chief hip-hop export, Nelly. While that artist made a name for himself pumping out radio-ready club bangers like \""Country Grammar (Hot S---)\"" and rapping about shoes (\""Air Force Ones\""), it's exactly those kinds of extravagances that Pirtle is rallying against. (It should come as no surprise that Pirtle's big pet project, \""Word,\"" is an urban musical about the end of hip-hop culture.)A great example of this is the Rapsys-produced track \""Uncle Tom,\"" which attacks racial stereotypes (like enjoying chicken) and contemplates why he's told he \""acts too white.\"" Lyrically, it's proof that intelligent, socially conscious hip-hop didn't die with A Tribe Called Quest. And, musically, its adventurous backing track is evidence of great showmanship: Even though Pirtle gets deep from time to time, never once does he skimp on the sounds that first hook listeners.Other immediate standouts on \""Pirtlean\"" include \""Inferno,\"" the dense, Flipmode Squad-esque \""Overstand\"" and \""What Makes Happy,\"" an expansive track that could do the unthinkable and get even the most ardent of hip-hop haters to listen.Any one of these would make for a nice introduction to Pirtle, an emcee who unequivocally deserves your time.\""Pirtlean\"" is available now.

Where that earlier \""Oh My God\"" track leaned toward the cool, nuanced Talking Heads of \""Take Me to the River\"" and a little grandiose posturing, this new(ish) song bursts out of your speakers with all the nervous energy of that legendary group's mid-'80s commercial heyday. It's bouncy and unpretentious, and, most importantly, it's an undeniable pleasure.Better still is the next track, \""All Over Again\"" -- which, as its title implies, takes everything that went right with the \""Hold On\""-to-\""New Delhi\"" and, you guessed it, does it all over again. It's every bit as catchy and mix tape-necessary as its predecessor, but it also incorporates the artsy overtones of, say, Talking Heads' 1977 single \""Love ? Building on Fire.\""But enough about David Byrne and his cohorts. Barbie Bangkok has applied a number of treatments outside of post-punk to its sound to craft the wholly enjoyable \""People and Geometry.\""The title track, for one, is a mesmerizing little number that is as much about Britpop as it is swirling melodies that are sure to dazzle even the most cynical of headphone-cradled ears.

Population: 237.A joke/cautionary tale Matt's been known to say: \""I had a friend from New York come up once [to my parents' house] and he was like, 'How did you even find out about college?'\""The results are anything but rural simplicity. Matt Johnson and Kim Schifino are electric warriors with a flair for producing metropolitan minefields that are both danceable and instantly infectious. Album No. 2 is no exception. I can see the songs on \""Grand\"" serving a number of purposes: fueling late-night parties, alleviating the stress of traffic jams and/or hawking iPhones and other \""Recession?

""His economic team will hit the ground running with no lag time and some, including myself, believe the team is already working with the existing team,"" said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist and managing director of Capitol Securities Management. J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., past president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said he has confidence in the team that Obama has put in place. He said he knows New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner, who will serve as Treasury secretary, and former Harvard President Lawrence Summers, who will be director of the National Economic Council. Geithner is very bright, Broaddus said. ""He is also pragmatic. He wants to find solutions to problems.... He has substantial experience dealing with financial crises."" Summers was Treasury secretary under President Clinton. ""We have two experienced people and Bernanke, a wonderful economist, at the helm,"" Broaddus said. Geithner has been working on the ***financial crisis** with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Broaddus said. ""They have been a threesome and that is an advantage,"" Broaddus said. ""He will provide important continuity as they move foreward."" Kim Scheeler, president and chief executive officer of the Greater Richmond Chamber, said the challenge will be to tackle fear and uncertainty. ""Anything they can do to alleviate that will help the economy,"" Scheeler said James Hatcher III, president of Pleasants Hardware, said he doesn't know if new policy or time alone will change the economic spiral. ""At the end of the day, we need the consumer to invest in the economy,"" Hatcher said. ""Nothing but bad news has affected the psyche."" ""Times like this give you an opportunity to look at business fundamentals."" For Pleasants Hardware, it means good cash management and taking really good care of customers, he said.

Just as it’s been since Dottie Herman and Howard Lorber bought the company in 2003, and as it will be until the day onyx bathrooms and heated-floor kitchens all cease to exist, the award will go to Dolly Lenz.“One of the great killers of all time,” Donald Trump called her at the firm’s awards ceremony five years ago, when Ms. Lenz fought off her slick-haired ex-protégé Michael Shvo, who had threatened to leave if he wasn’t named top broker.On Feb. 12, after seas of silk-scarved, shiny-shoed, power-suited real estate brokers shuffle into the Pierre’s ballroom, the colossal real estate brokerage Prudential Douglas Elliman will name its broker of the year. Just as it’s been since Dottie Herman and Howard Lorber bought the company in 2003, and as it will be until the day onyx bathrooms and heated-floor kitchens all cease to exist, the award will go to Dolly Lenz.“One of the great killers of all time,” Donald Trump called her at the firm’s awards ceremony five years ago, when Ms. Lenz fought off her slick-haired ex-protégé Michael Shvo, who had threatened to leave if he wasn’t named top broker. He left. Last year, Jackie Teplitzky, an Israeli Army sergeant–turned–broker, complained publicly that the ceremony’s rules had been changed to give the award to Ms. Lenz.But her biggest problems these days are these days themselves. Back in the bubbly autumn of 2007, Ms. Lenz was reported to have sold $748,319,000 of real estate the year earlier, four times higher than the country’s second-biggest broker. Since then, as the luxury housing market has fizzled gruesomely, she’s been replaced at her three biggest projects: the gargantuan white-brick Manhattan House; the New Age–branded Miraval Living; and Wall Street’s Cipriani Club Residences, where, the brokerage confirmed, Elliman’s Raphael De Niro, the actor’s son, has been the main broker for over a year.But everyone’s fallen. There are no super-powered super-brokers in the ***recession**. It’s made mortals of all, even the woman who once said things like “I don’t go through a lot of tirades, because I kind of just say, ‘That’s it. It’s over, O.K.? Sorry, can’t do that, goodbye.’” Even the agent whose ex-client Dennis Kozlowski called “Jaws.”“Who’s to say you go from ’07 and do more? The market is not the same. And it may never be the same,” Mr. Lorber, Elliman’s chairman, said this weekend. “No one’s very happy. Developers aren’t happy, brokers aren’t happy, customers aren’t happy.” He pointed out that it wouldn’t be a disgrace to have sold a little less last year. “It’s like you buy a stock at $1 and it goes to $100—and then to $50. Did you make $49, or did you lose $50? What do you measure from ... Didn’t we all like ’07 better than ’08?”But we are all not Dolly Lenz. She has her own BlackBerry commercial and, she says, 12 BlackBerrys. Her name is all over the real estate gossip pages—and her face is on real estate ads (next to Grace Kelly’s on one Manhattan House piece). When she’s on the Fox Business Channel, anchors say: “The No. 1 real estate agent in the country—this lady is just printing money!” Or: “Let us ask the Dolly.”“RIGHT NOW, everyone’s losing a few things. She might be losing more because she had more to begin with,” said Claudine De Niro, whose husband and associate, Raphael, took over at the 106-unit Cipriani Club Residences in September 2007. When first asked about the condo, she denied that Ms. Lenz had left the project, pointing out that the broker’s name was still on listings. Later, Ms. De Niro said, “We’re all hurting. No one’s doing great. If they are, tell me who they are. I’ll hire them.”Even though the Wall Street condo’s Web site says its units are 90 percent sold out, Mr. Lorber puts the figure at 70 to 75. “We said, ‘Maybe try something a little bit different.’ She was busy starting work at Miraval at the time, so we just said, ‘Look, Raphael’s a downtown broker.’”But Miraval, the condo at 515 East 72nd Street that promises “massage centers, aroma-therapy spas, in-house sex therapists and skyline views,” hasn’t gone perfectly, either. In November, when Ms. Lenz was replaced, only 107 of 365 units had reportedly been sold. “Miraval is now on its third marketing team,” Mr. Lorber said. “So whatever those issues are, they are.”“She’s a gifted dealmaker, but she’s not a marketing person,” said a source at Corcoran Sunshine, which took over from her at Miraval. “Good at marketing herself: Dolly Lenz as an institution, an epic, mythological figure. But not as far as laying out a strategic vision.”Then there was the massive Manhattan House, a pale gray, glazed-brick emblem of the bubble’s gigantism. Not only did the Truman-era rental sell for a record $625 million four years ago, but the new owners aimed to turn the thing into a $1.1 billion condo. Besides the project’s sheer size, its furious old tenants, its hefty financing problems and its tepid location between Second and Third avenues, the new co-owners, Jeremiah O’Connor and Richard Kalikow, had a brutal falling-out. Mr. Kalikow left in October 2007.In late January, the New York Post ran a feature about Ms. Lenz’s personal office in the Manhattan House, with its white silk roses and spotless glass desk. Later that day, according to The Real Deal, she was notified of the decision to remove her. Only a quarter of the 583 apartments had been contracted to sell, and only a third of those had actually closed.“When they start talking about 25 percent, it’s bullshit,” said Mr. Lorber, pointing out that a chunk of the 583 units had rent-stabilized tenants or simply hadn’t been put up for sale yet.“Look, as a company, would I have rather not lost it? Obviously,” Dottie Herman, Elliman’s CEO and co-owner, said later. “But, by the same token, if something is not going to sell at a certain price, you might as well stand on your head.”“It seems Dolly’s timing was bad since it coincided with the ***financial crisis** that no one anticipated or could stop,” said Joseph Aquino, an executive in Elliman’s retail real estate division, and a Manhattan House condo buyer. “The crisis was and still is global, and it was our 21st-century tsunami. It affected all of us.”“I admire her,” he said later. “They use the following parable when the stock market tanks: ‘When the prostitution house gets raided, they even take the piano player.’”BUT MS. LENZ has a Gatsby-like knack for transcendence. In a 2003 television interview, she and her husband said they spent, “swear to God, all the cash we had in the bank” on an $8,800 fur coat and nice dress so she could look the part of the power broker, back when she was just starting out. Four years later, asked by The Observer if she ever suffers envy, she said, “I’m just so busy doing ‘it.’ To covet you have to be outside ‘it,’ coveting.”When she goes on, say, CNBC to tell the post–Bear Stearns world, “I think we’re actually going to be perfectly O.K., if not possibly better off,” she doesn’t just look like a mega-agent, golden hair swooping down just so, perfect nose tilted up toward the camera; she looks like a mega-agent in a Robert Altman film. Even in print interviews there’s an air of ascendancy: In December, when brokers were starting to scamper around with their arms in the air, she told the Post, “I don’t see panic at all.”And when the Daily News ran a story last year that not only vaguely alluded to an oft-rumored affair between the broker and Mr. Lorber, but asked if she would leave the firm, she shrugged and said, “I don’t know why this starts every year.”“I guess that’s cute for the bloggers,” Ms. Herman said this week. “But at the end of the day, you know what counts? You know what buyers and sellers care about? They don’t really care what they did or didn’t do. They care about results.”So what exactly have Ms. Lenz’s results looked like since the November 2007 list put her sales at $748,319,000? She wasn’t included in the most recent list in November 2008—because, it turned out, Elliman declined to submit its agents’ stats.On Monday, Feb. 9, Ms. Herman was in an office with Elliman’s Manhattan president, Steven James, working on the upcoming award ceremony. When asked, Mr. James said that Ms. Lenz’s total commissions last year were her best ever: “Over $7 million.” He said some of that money had come from deals that were signed before 2008, but took a while to close. When this reporter called back to point out that Ms. Lenz has said her annual commissions have been as high as $9 million or $10 million, Mr. James hung up. “Then don’t use the information,” he said. “I’m going into my meeting. Goodbye.”“Tell her to show her 1099. All top brokers are curious to see,” one of the best agents in New York emailed this week, referring to the income tax form. Rivals don’t believe, for example, that one year’s sales could have been three-quarters of a billion dollars.“I don’t know how people think I make it up. They’re out of their minds,” Ms. Herman said later, going over the awards stats in her office. “You know what? It’s just ignorance, I’ll tell you that.”“Two thousand seven was lower, and 2008 was a bit higher,” she said about the firm’s top broker. In separate interviews, she and Mr. Lorber both offered to find specific dollar figures for Ms. Lenz, though Ms. Herman later apologized and said they were private.“THIS IS A problem when you’re No. 1: You can go only one way, right? You can’t go up,” said Leonard Steinberg, a colleague who recently got a batch of townhouse listings with Ms. Lenz and Mr. De Niro. “It’s not possible. Sometimes when I don’t sell anything after 12 months of trying, I feel like I’m the biggest loser on the planet. But guess what? I’m not. It’s not me, it’s the market.”Brokers obsess about other brokers, especially the aggressive ones, and they tend to get practically giddy at the thought of Ms. Lenz falling. “Think Madonna. When Madonna was at the height of career, everyone wanted to tear her down. And they did. And then she came up again. Let’s face it, American culture is cyclical,” Mr. Steinberg offered. “Dolly, for many people, has provided that sick entertainment where they want to see her fail.”Even Ms. Teplitzky at Elliman argued in interviews that she’d been robbed of last year’s top broker award, thinking she’d done better than Ms. Lenz. “I’ll give it to you straight: Jackie did not know there were a few things Dolly had done that she hadn’t turned in,” Ms. Herman said. “There were a few personal sales that Dolly made.” But which broker beat which didn’t make a difference: Ms. Teplitzky, who has her own team at Elliman, was put in the running for the brokerage’s top group award. She got it, just like Mr. Shvo got it back in 2004.But Dolly Lenz was still named top individual broker, just like she’ll be named top broker again on Feb. 12.“The true test is to watch what happens. Dolly’s not perfect, nor am I, nor is anybody. People are good, but we’re all human,” Ms. Herman said. “But I think the test is yet to come.”Ms. Lenz did not return several calls and emails, and representatives for Mr. Shvo, Ms. Teplitzky, Manhattan House, Miraval and even BlackBerry had no comment about working with her.On Feb. 6, she was walking near Central Park when another major Manhattan real estate figure, one of the several she’s publicly feuded with, walked by.“I’ve been told,” the associate said a few hours later, voice genuinely quivery, “that when you’re walking down a hallway, do not make eye contact, because it will remind her to get you. I swear to God, I’ve had a number of people tell me that.”But this figure’s eyes went up to meet Ms. Lenz’s. She went by without noticing! Or did she? “Something will happen in the next month, guaranteed. I don’t talk this way about other people. There’s something wrong with her. And she scares me.”mabelson@observer.com",0,,,
273,7VDW-JCB0-Y9NH-K1D0-00000-00.txt,"State Division of Highways officials were scrambling Thursday over the imminent demise of a bill that would freeze the adjustable portion of the state gas tax for 2010 - a move that would cost the already cash-strapped state Road Fund $70 million a year.The bill (SB680), which would continue the current freeze on the state fuel tax at 32.2 cents per gallon through the 2010 calendar year, was stuck in the House Finance Committee Thursday.Deputy Highways Commissioner Paul Turman said that, without the freeze, state Road Fund collections will fall by $70 million next year - effectively leaving the division without sufficient money to maintain state secondary roads.""Basically, about the only thing we'll be able to afford to do for two-thirds of the roads in the state is patching potholes and cutting grass,"" he said.As of Thursday, the bill was stuck in committee, and presumably dead, unless House leadership makes an exception and agrees to suspend the rule that a bill be read on the House floor on three separate days before passage.The final day to pass 2009 regular session bills is Saturday.House Speaker Rick Thompson, D-Wayne, said Thursday he supports Finance Chairman Harry Keith White's stand to let the bill die.""Make no mistake about it: this bill, if passed, would amount to a tax increase on the fuel that people need to get to work and to earn a living,"" Thompson said.""By opposing this gas tax increase, we have the opportunity to offer consumers a modest tax break in the midst of an ***economic downturn** the likes of which this nation has not seen in several generations,"" he said.Legislators imposed the freeze last year to keep the gas tax from going up as retail prices approached $4 a gallon.The adjustable portion of the tax is recalculated each January 1, based on average prices from the previous July through October. Without the rate freeze, Turman said the 2010 tax should drop next January by about a nickel a gallon.Complicating matters, he said, is that the state master plan for road construction projects assumes the gas tax will remain at 32.2 cents through the end of 2014 - potentially bringing the total amount of lost Road Fund revenue to $350 million.By comparison, the state's share of federal stimulus funding for highways totals $210 million.Mike Clowser of the state Contractors Association said the loss of gas-tax revenue would force highways to postpone road building projects that would have begun this summer and fall.He said many of the road projects funded this spring from stimulus funds will be nearing completion by then, leaving construction workers jobless.""We're going to need the equivalent of another stimulus bill just to keep our people employed,"" he said.Senate Finance Chairman Walt Helmick, D-Pocahontas, said he could not believe the House would allow the tax rate freeze to die.""People don't understand that this is a huge issue for the highways of West Virginia,"" he said. ""Anybody who drives knows the deteriorating condition of our highways.Helmick had argued against the current freeze, as well as a previous freeze in 2007, which cost the Road Fund $142 million in lost revenue.Matt Turner, spokesman for Gov. Joe Manchin, said the governor is concerned about the potential loss of Road Fund dollars - and the loss of road building projects.As to whether Manchin would put the issue on a special session call when the session reconvenes in May, Turner said, ""It's too early to say, but I will say he's very concerned about having adequate revenue to maintain our roadways.""Turman said the freeze would mean minimal savings for state drivers - an average of $40 a year.""That's might mean they would have to take the family to McDonald's after church one less day a year,"" he said.Reach Phil Kabler at philk@wvgazette.comor 304-348-1220.",0,,,
274,7WX1-HW00-Y9J0-Y0TP-00000-00.txt,"c(""Oct. 18--More students and higher tuition rates are filling major gaps in a University of Oregon budget hit by a big state funding cut and other losses.But even the revenue from more than 800 additional students and a 15 percent tuition increase isn't enough to cover this year's revenue drop, forcing the university to impose a 2.5 percent across-the-board cut from its 2008-2009 budget level. That means more students paying more tuition for classes that are more crowded.That caught up with student body president Emma Kallaway on the first day of fall term, when she walked into a class and found there were more students than desks.\""There was only a chair in the very back of the class,\"" she said, noting that other students reported similar problems. \""It's just kind of a visual sign of the hard times we're in.\""The UO is expected to bring in $37 million more in tuition revenue this year than last year, due to the combination of more students and the tuition hike. Tuition increased almost $1,000 this year, to $7,428 for a full-time resident undergraduate from $6,435 last year, not including a $150 surcharge imposed last year during spring term only.But state support shrank 20 percent -- or $16 million -- this year, to $64 million from $80 million last year, said Frances Dyke, the UO's vice president for finance and administration. That happened because the state faced a steep drop in personal income tax revenue as the ***recession** slammed Oregon with one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation.Dyke said the UO increased financial aid spending by $4 million to help students having the hardest time paying higher tuition. Students not only are paying more, the amount they get in need-based aid from the state also declined due to the budget cuts spurred by the ***recession**.The university also had to put $2 million back into its reserve funds to replace part of what it spent to make up for last-minute budget cuts imposed by the state last spring.Finally, Dyke said the UO will get $7 million less in unrestricted revenue, money that comes in part from university assessments and interest on some donations. The largest portion of that revenue is used to fund the university's development office, its primary fundraising arm.It was the development office that helped spearhead the successful CampaignOregon, which wound up last year and raised more than $850 million. Dyke said private fundraising is so critical to the university, particularly as state support falls, that UO officials will use some of the tuition revenue to replace the drop in unrestricted revenue.\""In an era where fundraising is everything, where our future under declining (state) resources has to do with how much in private funds we can raise, we're not going to abandon the development program,\"" she said.All together, replacing reserves, making up for losses in state and other funding and increasing student aid will cost $29 million, Dyke said. That leaves $8 million left from the higher tuition income to go back into general revenues to help cover rising costs and educating more students.But the UO needs $14 million to do that and maintain programs, Dyke said. That's why a 2.5 percent budget cut was imposed, saving the remaining $6 million.And that comes even though salary and benefit costs are expected to be mostly flat.Dyke said health insurance costs and Public Employee Retirement System contributions are not projected to rise significantly this year.Wages also are flat. Workers represented by the Service Employees International Union recently ratified a contract that essentially has no net raises, and no across-the-board faculty salary increases are planned, Dyke said.To see more of The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore., or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.registerguard.com.

276,7Y85-VPG1-2S4G-M087-00000-00.txt,"(RTTNews) - Asian stock markets are exhibiting a mixed trend on Monday with participants treading a cautious path due to renewed worries about the pace of economic recovery following disappointing jobs data from U.S. Though some of the markets in the region rebounded after a weak start, they are seen struggling to hold at higher levels due to lack of support.In the Australian market, select materials, energy and technology stocks are trading higher, while financials and industrials are exhibiting weakness.The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index, which fell to 4,592.6 in early trades, is currently up in positive territory at 4,605, with a gain of 3.3 points, or 0.1%. The broader All Ordinaries index is trading at 4,609, up 2.9 points, or 0.1%, over its previous close.On Friday, the S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index had plunged 99.4 points, or 2.11%, to 4,601.7 and the All Ordinaries index fell 95.9 points, or 2.04%, to 4,606.1 on renewed doubts about a global recovery following some weak economic reports from U.S.Top miners BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto are up 1.2% and 0.6% respectively. Among other stocks in the materials space, Newcrest Mining is up 2.3%, Orica is trading nearly 1% up and Lihir Gold is gaining 1.75%. Fortescue Metals and Bluescope Steel are trading modestly lower.Energy stocks Woodside Petroleum, Santos and Origin Energy are trading with modest gains, while Oil Search is down in the red with a 1.2% loss.Among bank stocks, Westpac Banking Corporation is down 1.2%, National Australia Bank is trading 1.4% down, ANZ Bank is declining by about 1.3% and Commonwealth Bank of Australia is trading modestly lower. Diversified financials Macquarie Group is down sharply by 3.6%.AWB Ltd has announced that an appeal against a court ruling in its favour in the United States in relation to the Iraqi wheat kickbacks scandal has been dismissed. The appeal was brought by persons representing residents of the three northern governorates of Iraq. The plaintiffs had filed their appeal soon after the original case was dismissed in October 2008.The class action had alleged that by reason of AWB&amp;apos;s conduct during the United Nations oil-for-food program, AWB had depleted the UN oil-for-food escrow account, thereby unlawfully depriving the plaintiffs of the humanitarian benefits which those funds would have purchased for them. It had also alleged that AWB, BNP Paribas and CSC engaged in an illegal conspiracy. The AWB stock is currently trading nearly 2% down from its previous closing price.Shares of HealthLinx Ltd are up nearly 8% following the company securing A$7.23 million to help it commercialise its ovarian cancer diagnostic, OvPlex, and to fund further trials of OvPlex. HealthLinx said on Monday that it had secured a A$7.23 million convertible note at zero interest, to be advanced over three years, from a New York-based institutional investor, SpringTree Special Opportunities Fund.On the economic front, the number of job advertisements in Australia has increased for a second straight month in a further sign the economy has passed through the worst of the global downturn and is on the road to recovery. According to a report published by ANZ Banking Group, the number of jobs advertised in newspapers and on the internet rose 4.4% in September. It was the strongest pace of increase since December 2007 and followed a 4.1% improvement in August. Job ads had declined for 15 straight months between May 2008 and July this year.In the currency market, the Australian dollar opened lower on Monday with demand for risk-sensitive assets falling on weak economic data from U.S. In early trades, the Australian dollar was quoting at US$0.8661-US$0.8665, down 0.32% from Friday&amp;apos;s close of US$0.8689-US$0.8693. The Australian dollar is currently trading at 0.8731 to the U.S. dollar.Besides renewed concerns about the pace of economic recovery, the yen&amp;apos;s strength against the dollar also contributed to the weakness in the Japanese stock market. Despite staging a recovery of sorts after a weak start, the market drifted lower as investors chose to exit at higher levels.The benchmark Nikkei 225 Average, which recovered after a sharp fall, was up 4.76 points, or 0.05%, at 9,736.63 at the end of the morning session.Automobile stocks ToyotaMotor and Nissan Motor posted modest gains, while SuzukiMotor and HondaMotor were trading lower. Among bank stocks, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial, Resona Holdings and Mizuho Financial edged higher.Steel and non-ferrous metals stocks were mostly trading lower at the break. Machinery and electric machinery stocks also exhibited weakness.

277,53Y6-YK61-F12G-D258-00000-00.txt,"Early signs of ""euphoria"" over the beginning of a recovery in the real economy are premature and dangerous, Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz said Wednesday.""In the media, I am reading about signs of positive indicators in the economy. This kind of euphoria is dangerous, and it is too early, since we are in the midst of a deep crisis and there is still a long way until we see the end of the crisis,"" he said Wednesday in Eilat at the Caesarea Economic Forum, sponsored by the Israel Democracy Institute. ""Economic indicators of the past months do not point to an end of the ***economic crisis**, while signs of a recovery of the stock market are not an indicator for recovery in the real economy.""Steinitz cited negative-growth data in the economy, which contracted by an annualized 3.9 percent in the first quarter of the year, and the sharp drop in exports, which fell close to 25%.""The Israeli public and the economic media understand the uniqueness of this crisis compared to previous crises experienced in the past,"" he said, ""while among government representatives and Knesset members there is a certain feeling of indifference and ignorance to the set of priorities needed during a crisis. Everything is important - health, education, the periphery; but today, the priority has to be the economy. There is a real threat to the world economy, and if we are not careful, it could hit us, too.""Nevertheless, Steinitz said there was room for ""cautious optimism"" regarding the economy. He said recent votes of confidence in the local economy, such as the upgrading of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to developed status at MSCI Inc. at a time of great uncertainty around the world, was a sign of the country's resilient and persevering economy and its international recognition.Steinitz emphasized that the central question facing the Israeli economy was two-fold: not only how to best cope with the repercussions of the crisis, but more importantly, how to maintain and strengthen its relative advantage.""The crucial challenge of the Israeli economy is to maintain and prevent great losses in exports, which make of 45% of our growth, in particular in the area of hi-tech,"" he said. ""We export knowledge, and any losses cannot be offset by trying to boost the domestic market, as is the case in other countries, since we don't produce consumer goods. Therefore, the economic efficiency plan focuses on measures to help exporters, such as easing insurance conditions for export risk and maintaining a reasonable shekel-dollar exchange rate.""Meanwhile, David Artzi, chairman of the Israel Export Institute, on Wednesday urged Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer and Steinitz to take immediate steps to halt the continued depreciation of the shekel-dollar exchange rate, which dropped below NIS 3.9 on Wednesday, to NIS 3.85, from NIS 3.93 on Tuesday.""Israeli exports are in danger,"" he said. ""I call upon the governor to increase the amount of daily dollar purchases so that we don't fall back into last year's scenario, when the shekel-dollar exchange rate dropped to a low of NIS 3.2. I urge the finance minister to activate measures that have not yet been used to halt the sharp drop of the dollar against the shekel.""",1,,,
278,7VB8-J5D0-Y8TC-S4GJ-00000-00.txt,"President Obama is facing challenges to American power on multiple fronts as he prepares for his first trip overseas since taking office, with the nation's economic woes emboldening allies and adversaries alike.  Despite his immense popularity around the world, Mr. Obama will confront resentment over American-style capitalism and resistance to his economic prescriptions when he lands in London on Tuesday for the Group of 20 summit meeting of industrial and emerging market nations plus the European Union.  The president will not even try to overcome NATO's unwillingness to provide more troops in Afghanistan when he goes on later in the week to meet with the military alliance.   He seems unlikely to return home with any more to show for his attempts to open a dialogue with Iran's leaders, who have, so far, responded with tough words, albeit not tough enough to persuade Russia to support the United States in tougher sanctions against Tehran. And he will be tested in face-to-face meetings by the leaders of China and Russia, who have been pondering the degree to which the power of the United States to dominate global affairs may be ebbing.   Mr. Obama is unlikely to push for specific commitments from other countries on stimulus spending to bolster their own economies, White House officials acknowledged Saturday in a teleconference call, despite the fact that administration officials would like to see European countries, in particular, increase their spending to try to prompt a glo-bal economic recovery.   ''Nobody is asking any country to come to London to commit to do more right now,'' said Michael Froman, deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs. Instead, world leaders at the meeting will try to ''do whatever is necessary to restore global growth,'' Mr. Froman said.  The challenges stem in part from lingering unhappiness around the world at the way the Bush administration used American power. But they have been made more intense by the sense in many capitals that the United States is no longer in any position to dictate to other nations what types of economic policies to pursue -- or to impose its will more generally as it intensifies the war in Afghanistan and extracts itself from Iraq.  ''There is a direct challenge under way to the paradigms that America has been trying to sell to the rest of the world,'' said Eswar S. Prasad, a former China division chief at the International Monetary Fund. The American banking collapse, which precipitated the global meltdown, has led to a fundamental rethinking of the American way as a model for the rest of the world. Yet even as his presence stirs opposition to particular American policies, Mr. Obama is being welcomed by many Europeans as an embodiment of American ideals.   In Prague, where Mr. Obama will stop later in the week, local officials are installing a hot line for residents to find out about street closings. In Strasbourg, France, site of a NATO meeting, protesters are planning an ''international resistance camp'' with antiwar actions designed to press Mr. Obama to get American troops out of Afghanistan. In Istanbul, his last stop, workers are polishing up the Hagia Sophia basilica-cum-mosque-cum-museum for the expected visit.   ''The rest of the world is yearning for him,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economist. ''On the one hand, they'll all be criticizing him, and criticizing the American model. But they all want to hear that he does have a miracle to deliver.''  The quandary has left senior advisers to Mr. Obama scrambling to come up with a way for him to project both American power  and the new cooperative international model that his aides have been promising.   Mr. Obama will try to show confidence that his stimulus and economic program will work, administration officials said, while conceding that it may take time. He will say that he has put all the pieces in place to fix the American economy, while acknowledging that in a global system nations cannot put up walls to protect their individual economies.   Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, said the president ''must demonstrate to the world that he understands that it's not just about saving ourselves.''   And Mr. Obama must try to do all of that in the middle of a global ***recession** for which most of the world blames the United States. ''The U.S. brand name has clearly suffered from this crisis, and the rest of the world is no longer willing to sit quietly and be lectured by the United States on how they should conduct economic policy,'' Mr. Rogoff said.  A senior Obama administration official acknowledged that it would be harder for Mr. Obama to exhort other countries to adopt the American model. But Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, said Saturday in the conference call that Mr. Obama ''is going to listen in London, as well as to lead.''  ''Many of the things we've done in the past week demonstrate that America is leading by example,'' he said.   In the past, American officials traveled to India, Brazil, China and South Africa and lectured government officials on the need for open markets, free trade and deregulation. But now some of those very policies -- particularly deregulation -- are viewed as the culprits for the recent economic collapse.   ''Emerging markets now think they can do what they want without hectoring from the United States,'' said Mr. Prasad, the former monetary fund official.  Compounding the problem for Mr. Obama is that the route that he has chosen to lead the United States out of the mess -- heavy government spending -- is not available to many other countries. European governments, for instance, are far more lukewarm about enormous  stimulus programs because they already have strong social safety nets, and more fears of inflation, than does the United States.  So when Mr. Obama meets with other world leaders  in London, he will be confronting a philosophical divide, with the United States on the defensive not just on economic issues like trade and financial regulation but also on a variety of national security and diplomatic matters.  After he leaves London, Mr. Obama will go to the French-German border for a NATO meeting at a time when European governments, under pressure from their populations, are looking for the exit doors in Afghanistan even as the United States sends more troops and money.   Administration officials had initially said they hoped to get more troop contributions at the NATO meeting; now they do not even talk about securing more troops from the Europeans, in a tacit acknowledgment that the forces will not be coming.  ''I hope that Afghanistan will not be Obama's war, because it should be owned by all of us,'' said NATO's secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer.   But there are already twice as many American troops as NATO troops in Afghanistan, and ''Europe will never be able to match the numbers of the Americans in Afghanistan,'' Mr. de Hoop Scheffer said. The NATO summit meeting, he said, ''will not be about troop contributions.''  In Prague, Mr. Obama will confront an Eastern Europe nervous about Russian attempts to reassert itself in an area that Moscow views as its backyard. Mr. Obama has taken pains to reassure Russia that his administration will tread carefully  regarding Bush administration plans to locate a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic.   Yet in placating Russia, Mr. Obama has raised hackles in Poland, where officials seek closer ties to the United States. ",1,,,
279,4RNS-09N0-TWCX-R1K3-00000-00.txt,"For those blindly following the Street's party line, there's a good chance they could be joining the line into the poorhouse.Recent examples of this phenomenon are the widely touted dot-com craze of the early 2000s and the rush to real estate in recent years. In both cases, investor losses were tremendous.The latest party line: The worst is over for the nation's roughly 80 million stock players following the avalanche of panic selling that pounded markets around the globe last week. A sunny second half lies ahead, and this is a good time to buy stocks because they're so cheap.Key reasons: The Federal Reserve's recent string of rate cuts, another of which is expected Wednesday, and the president's proposed $145 billion economic stimulus package, both of which are designed to bail out America's ailing economy and prevent a ***recession**.Not buying the party line are five pros who argue the wild rollercoaster ride is far from over and more pain lies ahead.One is Oppenheimer &amp; Co.'s chief investment strategist, Michael Metz. ""We may be close to a short-term bottom, but we're looking at a painful ***recession**, the worst ever in the postwar period, that should last into 2009,"" he tells me. Over the near term, Mr. Metz sees a market rally, given the Fed's rate cut, but he predicts the temporary upswing will evolve into a significant decline that will drag the Dow down about 1,000 points by May.A market analyst at Weiss Research of Jupiter, Fla., Tony Sagami, offers a more ominous outlook. He views last Tuesday's volatile, ulcer-producing showing - a 464-point early morning plunge in the Dow before an eventual loss on the day of 128.11 points - as a sign of what's ahead. ""You can sum up in one word - pain,"" he says. Citing such additional woes as a further weakening of the housing market and implosion of the credit markets, he predicts another vicious drop in the Dow of 2,000 to 3,000 points before year-end.""The Fed easing is not going to help that much,"" Mr. Sagami says. ""The real estate and credit bubbles have to be wiped out and that's going to take years."" His provocative strategy: ""I'd be a buyer of non-dollar denominated stocks and a seller of everything else.""A veteran stockbroker at Kern, Suslow Securities, Malcolm Lowenthal, also refuses to buy the Street's party line. ""Common sense tells you there's a lot more to hit the fan,"" he says, pointing to the likelihood of additional huge writedowns at financial institutions, further housing decay, the possibility of a major debacle in credit cards, and the fallout from a rapidly slowing economy. ""At some point the chaos will be over, but that could take another year and in the interim we're going lower,"" he says.Overseas, a money manager at Hong Kong-based HK Investments Ltd., Selwyn Ortz, notes a major international worry is that ""the president's economic rescue package will turn out to be impotent, falling far short of staving off a ***recession**,"" in turn triggering a host of further ***economic slowdown**s around the globe.San Francisco money manager Gary Wollin, who runs nearly $100 million of assets under the banner Gary Wollin &amp; Co., sees ""another big leg down, perhaps a further drop in the Dow of 300 to 400 points."" There's just no need to put money to work in the next 30 days because there's still a lot of nervousness out there that could easily drive stock prices lower, he says. The manager, who expects America's economic problems to worsen, has about a third of his clients' assets in cash.In response to the Fed easing, Mr. Wollin insists nothing much has changed. He considers the Fed action more of a backstop, designed to prevent the gigantic market declines that have occurred in Europe and Asia.Still, he says, if you look a year out, certain stocks are attractive. In particular, he points to Kohl's, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. For investors willing to take more of a risk, he says IBM, Microsoft, and Intel ""look awfully cheap.""On the other hand, Mr. Metz says he would sell anything to do with discretionary spending by the consumer. He adds that he would shun retailers, financials, and real estate, especially commercial.On the buy side, he favors select North American oil production and exploration companies, theorizing that a number of them will be snapped up by energy biggies bent on expanding their reserves. Four names are favored, Anadarko Petroleum, Pioneer Natural Resources, Chesapeake Energy, and XTO Energy""Dan, how do you personally see the market?"" Marcus Lewin asks via e-mail. I say, everyone agrees we're in for economic hardship ahead; that's what falling stock prices are all about.dandordan@aol.com",1,,,

The Spokane City Council approved the position - at a cost of about $120,000 a year in pay and benefits - that will promote government efficiency based on Lean Six Sigma, a business-efficiency program popularized by General Electric, Toyota and other companies. Supporters say the program helps organizations improve service and reduce costs. The vote follows a City Council decision earlier this year to offer a no-bid contract to the Indiana-based Lasater Institute for up to $90,000 to train 16 city workers in Six Sigma. Officials say the ***economic crisis** highlights the need for a full-scale Six Sigma program, but it follows other cost-cutting attempts that have been abandoned. Most recently, Mayor Mary Verner shelved a controversial efficiency report from a California consulting group that the city paid $260,000 to complete. Spokane leaders say Six Sigma is likely to result in real savings because it empowers city employees to make changes. \""All the successful implementations of Six Sigma, be it federal, municipal or even in the private sector, they all have a central office where the program is administered,\"" City Administrator Ted Danek said. Former City Council candidate Donna McKereghan has criticized the city's use of a firm outside the Inland Northwest to train city employees in Six Sigma methods. More recently, she questioned if leaders had done their homework. \""This approach has huge potential - for improvement but for destruction, as well,\"" McKereghan said in an e-mail to city officials last week. \""If the city of Spokane wanders into it without keen awareness and careful caution of that fact, it could spell disaster at one of the worst times in our economic history.\"" The council voted 6-0 in support of the new job. Councilwoman Nancy McLaughlin was absent. Mayor Mary Verner appointed Dave Steele, the city's real estate manager, to the new role, pending the council approval that came Tuesday. Steele's old job will be filled. City officials said the new job won't add to the budget because they eliminated a position in the engineering office. Even so, the total compensation will be about $45,000 more than the eliminated job. The difference will come from money raised through utility bills. \""We're hoping that the utility money will wind up bringing savings in the long run,\"" City Councilman Bob Apple said. City Councilman Steve Corker said it often costs money to formulate concepts that will save money. \""Sometimes you lose the battle to win the war,\"" Corker said. Danek said Six Sigma has already made the city more efficient, leading the city to streamline its approval process for contracts that don't require City Council support from an average of 29 days to 10 days. \""These employees are now left to do more important things rather than walk a piece of paper through the bureaucracy at City Hall,\"" Danek said.&amp;t;b&amp;t;""

281,7VDD-3DT0-Y92T-G094-00000-00.txt," I think all of us were caught off guard, at least to some extent, by the ***economic downturn**. Even people who saw it coming were shocked by how quickly the housing market went south and the financial system crumbled. But Laura and her husband face a situation more dire than most. Laura sent me an e-mail to say her husband spent the last eight years as a real estate investor after selling a successful business. ""He had cash at the time to invest,"" Laura wrote. ""Well, you know what has happened."" They own eight properties that have not sold. Her husband has not had an income for about a year, and her salary barely covers their own home payment and living expenses. ""We have been making all of the property, insurance and utility payments ? so far,"" she wrote. ""Two are being rented for an amount that is about $1,000 short of our payments for them, and the other properties (including our primary residence) are all for sale, but none of the offers have gone through. We are coming to the end of our savings and in fact have charged a couple of our credit cards almost to the max. ""Where do we go from here? There is a lot of equity in each of the properties ? more than enough to pay the mortgages and our debts ? but no sale in sight. Do we use everything up hoping that something will sell and keep us in business for a while longer, or do we let it all go now, so that there will be a few thousand dollars left for my husband to invest in starting over in a new career? ? What are the options besides bankruptcy or foreclosure?  We have never been in a situation like this before ? always paid our debts, had money and had great credit scores."" Wow, what a difficult situation. For some ideas on how to respond, I talked to Mike Peterson, spokesman for American Credit Foundation in Midvale.  Mike says he would first advise Laura's husband to find a job as quickly as possible making as much as he can, ""even if he needs to start over again and start at the bottom and start working his way up ? If he has not been doing anything but waiting and hoping for these homes to sell, let's go to work and bring some income that can help."" Next, Mike says, he would examine the equity situation of the homes. ""Are we talking about equity in the market of a year ago, and they're trying to get the prices at that level? I guess I would ask, is there equity if they blew these out at fire-sale prices? ? If so, that would probably be my next recommendation, is not trying to get what they think the market may be bearing today, but put it out there under a fire-sale situation and try to get out from under them,"" Mike says. He recommends that Laura and her husband sit down with the company or companies that hold the mortgages on the homes and see if those companies would let them forgo some payments while they try to do a fire sale, or refinance at a better interest rate. Mike says he also thinks they would be wise to seek the advice of an estate-planning attorney or real estate attorney who might be able to help them come up with some different options ""to help them preserve assets in the event that it gets really ugly."" ""I think the housing market will probably start coming back, but not until next year,"" Mike says. ""But even then, it probably will take years to get to the values we saw two years ago. If they don't have a long-term ability to make the payments and maintain those assets, then they probably should focus on his career and not run completely into the ground."" Another idea is to look around and see if there's anything they can sell, he says. And both Laura and her husband might want to pick up additional, part-time jobs in evenings or on weekends to try to increase their income. This is tough advice, Mike says, but that's what comes of such a tough situation. I hope you are able to get out from under those homes, Laura. Please drop me a line and let me know what you decide to do. If you have financial questions or comments, send them to gkratz@desnews.com or to the Deseret News, P.O.

282,7WHJ-K970-Y9NV-20MD-00000-00.txt,"At Hannaford Bros. stores, antiseptic cart-wipe dispensers are being refilled more regularly, a basic step the supermarket chain is taking to help protect customers and workers from the potential spread of H1N1 influenza.Behind the scenes, Hannaford has contingency plans that could outfit workers with gloves and masks, so they could keep stores open during a pandemic.''We're not near that threshold, and no one's contemplating that will happen,'' said Michael Norton, a Hannaford spokesman. ''But we're an important public institution, and we'd be prepared to do what we need to do.''Hannaford's actions show how, in small and big ways, Maine employers are gearing up to do business this fall and winter under the threat of H1N1 flu. They are contemplating how to deal with high absentee rates, reviewing sick leave and return-to-work policies and taking measures to keep employees and customers from spreading the virus.No one knows how the swine flu threat will unfold, but a report released this past week for the White House said that half the U.S. population could be infected. That means that, beyond schools and child care centers, workplaces need to be prepared, especially those that provide essential services.The need is being magnified by the lingering ***economic downturn**, which has led companies to cut staffs and delegate more functions to remaining workers.The cleaning crews at Kennebunk Savings Bank are doing a more vigorous job disinfecting door handles and ATM keypads. And the bank recently tested its pandemic planning, which would let it consolidate operations in a few branches, expand Internet banking and serve customers at drive-up windows.''Customers want their money, and they need to have comfort that we'll be there for them,'' said Dennis Byrd, the bank's chief operating officer.Much of the planning, not surprisingly, is being done by large employers with more resources. What's unclear is the preparedness of small businesses, those that depend on a handful of workers to keep operating.''For a lot of small businesses, I suspect it's going to be a slow process,'' said David Clough, state director of the National Federation of Independent Business. ''It may seem pretty theoretical and abstract to them.''COMMON-SENSE STANCE FAVOREDWorkplaces of all sizes got some guidance this month when the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new recommendations for businesses. Many adults spend at least part of their day in the workplace, so public health officials want to focus on reducing the spread of the virus among staff members and protecting higher-risk workers, such as pregnant women, while maintaining business operations.Specific measures include:n Encouraging workers to get vaccinated.n Improving hygiene and surface cleaning.n Keeping sick workers at home and asking employees who get sick at work to go home.n Being prepared for workers to be absent while tending to family members or responding to school or day-care closures.The guidelines are based on a flu outbreak similar to the one last spring. If conditions worsen this winter, the CDC recommends additional measures, including screening workers each day for signs of illness, letting employees work from home and increasing ''social distancing'' in the workplace - keeping people at least 6 feet apart at most times.The guidelines are meant to provide a framework that employers can adjust to suit their needs, says Dr. Dora Anne Mills, who directs Maine's Center for Disease Control and Prevention.''We can tell everyone in society, 'Stay 6 feet away, wear a mask and stay home,' but it's almost laughable,'' she said. ''It would just be too disruptive. So it's a matter of figuring out what makes sense.''L.L. Bean, which has 5,000 employees, 4,000 of them in Maine, is seeking that balance.The Freeport-based company already offers seasonal flu shots and expects to offer the H1N1 vaccine when it's available. The occupational health department has active programs in customer service and distribution areas to remind workers to wash their hands and cough into their sleeves. Hand sanitizers are scattered around the workplace.L.L. Bean has paid sick leave, which applies to workers who have to take care of family members. If the flu season is a bad one, the company plans to tailor the policy to cover situations in which ill workers might otherwise be penalized for staying home.At the same time, Bean doesn't want sensational media reports and misinformation to guide decisions. So it plans to ramp up communication and educational efforts to keep workers updated.''We're trying to look at it realistically and avoid any hysteria,'' said Carolyn Beem, a company spokeswoman.Hannaford is leaning on its team of wellness professionals, supermarket managers and in-store pharmacies to provide information and find the right balance between protecting workers and maintaining operations.It has 9,200 workers and 54 stores in Maine, and it plans to follow the latest CDC guidelines for sick workers: Anyone who appears to have flu symptoms should be separated from workers and advised to go home until at least 24 hours after their body temperature is below 100 degrees.''We don't want anyone back unless they're fever- and symptom-free for 24 hours,'' Norton said.Kennebunk Savings plans to let some people work from home through secure Internet connections, if necessary. All U.S. banks are now required to plan for operations during natural disasters and pandemics.Kennebunk Savings got some real-world practice last spring, when the flu outbreak prompted schools and day-care centers in Kennebunk to close.''The communication piece is key,'' said Byrd, the chief operating officer. ''It's like a snow day.''BIG CHALLENGE FOR SMALLER FIRMSThe CDC guidelines will be harder to follow for small businesses. Many don't have paid sick leave, which puts extra pressure on some workers to show up, even if they're not well or a child is sick at home, said Clough, the small-business representative.''The issue for smaller companies is, there's a job that's got to get done,'' he said. ''They don't want to let down other employees or customers, so they'll come to work, unless they're too sick.''That's a concern for Mary Allen Lindemann, co-owner of Coffee By Design in Portland. The company has 40 workers in four locations and can't afford paid sick leave.She doesn't want sick employees to come to work, however, and is reviewing plans for well workers to swap shifts and cover for sick ones. In a worst-case scenario, she could limit hours at a coffee house, or even close one for a time.Last spring, Lindemann posted public health signs circulated by Portland's Downtown District that told workers about the need to wash hands and other hygiene tips.She posted them in restrooms and may put new ones on coffee house bulletin boards - a message for both employees and customers.''It's definitely on our radar screen,'' she said.

284,4THJ-CN50-TW8F-G0F1-00000-00.txt,"Congress took on the $700 billion bailout on Tuesday with what Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana,  called ''the most palpable sense of national crisis since we gathered here in this building immediately following the 9/11 attacks.''  That's not exactly how it looked  to those trying to follow the testimony of Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.   Crisis connotes rolled-up sleeves, pots of coffee and the casting aside of protocol, ceremony and partisan grandstanding. Instead, what viewers saw was Washington as usual: senators pontificating while behind them aides whispered and sent text messages on their BlackBerrys. Congress still doesn't seem to understand that the camera not only adds 10 pounds, it also takes away dignity and self-serving excuses.   The question-and-answer part was long, complicated and hard to follow, with lots of technical references to ''reverse auctions,'' financial shorthand (''moral hazard'' and ''naked short'' ) and senatorial oratory (''Charybdis'' is the word Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, used to warn of rash action.)   And that only accentuated the long and redundant windup. Almost every member of the Senate Banking Committee wagged a finger at what they described as Wall Street's greed and lax regulatory oversight. Just about all of them voiced passionate concern for the ordinary taxpayer. And every one of them felt the need to say so on television. That loquacity drove cable news programs to cover other events like the stock market and the General Assembly. C-Span 3 stayed the course.   Despite all the talk of urgency, all 21 committee members clung to their prerogative of making an opening statement, including one who arrived after the witnesses had already begun giving their testimony  --  and it took almost two hours before Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues had a chance to explain their proposal. A few senators did heed an admonition by the chairman, Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, and cut their time short; but not all, perhaps because Mr. Dodd made full indignant use of his allotted eight minutes.  ''This was no act of God,'' Mr. Dodd said. ''This was not like Hurricane Hike  --  Ike, rather. It was created by a combustible combination of private greed and public regulatory neglect, and now we must confront the present crisis.''  The senators evidently wanted to convince an anxious, angry public that they are just as enraged. ''Does Wall Street owe the American people an apology?'' Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, asked Mr. Bernanke. Mr. Bernanke took him literally and said Wall Street is an ''abstraction.'' But he conceded that ''a lot of people made big mistakes.''  What none of the senators were ready to do was apologize for their own mistakes. Mr. Dodd, who has received more contributions from Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac's political action committees and employees ($133,900 since 1989) than any other senator, didn't mention lapses in Congressional oversight. Instead, he said he began warning Mr. Bernanke many months ago about the housing crisis, blaming  absentee regulators and ''reckless, careless and sometimes unscrupulous actors in the mortgage lending industry.''  Senator Elizabeth Dole, Republican of North Carolina, used her time to take aim at ''Congressional apologists'' for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac who blocked legislation she and other Republicans had proposed to rein them in. She said an ''army of lobbyists'' had spent as much as $100 million to thwart reform efforts. ''As we know, one of my committee colleagues proclaimed in April 2005 that Fannie and Freddie have done, and I quote, 'a very, very good job.' '' She was referring to Mr. Schumer.  The blame game, however, is already being played and replayed on the campaign trail. Viewers concerned about the ***economic crisis** are more likely to reward unity and swift, decisive action. Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, said the bailout plan made him feel ''frightful to the point of almost panic.''   The hearing wasn't exactly reassuring.",1,,,

286,4VGD-VMB0-TW87-N0K9-00000-00.txt,"A measure allowing bankruptcy judges to modify the mortgages of troubled homeowners, including cutting the principal they owe, cleared a key congressional committee yesterday.Under  legislation passed by the House Judiciary Committee, a bankruptcy judge could change the terms of a loan by reducing its interest rate, extending its length, or lowering the principal or loan balance. These are known as ""cramdown"" provisions.""While bankruptcy reform may not provide all of the answers to this crisis, surely it provides a common sense and practical approach to helping stop the spiral of home foreclosures, which are not helping anyone,""  committee Chairman Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) said.Debate on the measure fell mostly along partisan lines with several Republican amendments proposed to curb the impact of the bill, including limiting it to subprime mortgages or other types of risky loans. That amendment failed.The committee agreed that if a judge lowered the principal owed, the homeowner would have to share the profit from any sale of the property with their lender.  The panel also approved a Republican amendment excluding people who have committed mortgage fraud from receiving such modifications.But there were fewer amendments than expected, and the bill passed  21 to 15.Similar measures have stalled for years, but the change to bankruptcy law is gaining traction. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and President Obama have pushed for it. Its proponents received another boost when Citigroup announced its support  this month.Democrats have backed off efforts to include the provision in the economic stimulus package that's making its way through Congress. Now supporters are weighing other vehicles that would move the cramdown legislation quickly, while it also makes its way through the House as a standalone bill.Banking executives privately acknowledge that some type of legislation is likely to pass and are arguing that its scope should be limited. ""The fraud amendment is a positive step, but more needs to be done to limit the ability to abuse the bill,"" said Scott E. Talbott, a senior vice president of government affairs for the Financial Services Roundtable, an industry group.",1,,,
287,7WRG-GVY0-Y9F1-W048-00000-00.txt,"Little more than a year ago, after the collapse of Bear Stearns but just before the implosion of Lehman Bros. and the ensuing shock to the credit markets, Michael Pollack sat in a conference room high atop Reed Smith L.L.P.'s Center City offices and ventured a few educated guesses about near-term prospects for Big Law.Reed Smith, a 1,600-lawyer firm, was finishing an extraordinary growth spurt. Since 2000, the firm had catapulted from the ranks of a modest regional player with 600 lawyers to a global firm with nearly half its lawyers outside the United States.The gathering storm clouds in the United States were cause for worry, said Pollack, the firm's head of global strategy. But he said it was the firm's belief that its business in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East would be a cushion against the economic turmoil.Within a few short months, the legal services market in the United States had crashed, and law firms, particularly those that relied heavily on the financial markets, took an enormous hit. Layoffs came in waves.But it turns out that the international business has been a pretty good hedge.Business has rebounded powerfully in China - people are actually doing IPOs there - and Reed Smith is looking to add an office in Shanghai to ones in Hong Kong and Beijing. The firm has 130 lawyers in China.Reed Smith's hedging strategy involved lots of international business, a powerful surge of bankruptcy work, and a new hyper-attentiveness to client concerns.""We are not going to pull back,"" Pollack said in a recent interview. ""We are committed to being an international law firm.""About overall conditions facing law firms, he added: ""A lot of the talk now is about trying to align the interests of the firm with the client. It is like any other economic situation. The buyer has become more powerful today than he was 18 months ago.""For all the doomsday scenarios circulating in the legal world, there are myriad firms in Philadelphia and around the nation that have employed their own strategies to compensate for a sluggish economy.If these firms share one core trait, it is that they have broad ranges of practice areas. They don't have a huge reliance on a single area of expertise.If financial services or real estate plummets, then bankruptcy and, in some cases, litigation often compensate. Firms that have the resources to wait out the bad times can gobble up business when things turn around.Small- to mid-size firms, such as Schnader Harrison Segal &amp; Lewis L.L.P., have gotten business from hard-to-crack companies by marketing high-end legal services at lower hourly rates, at least compared with larger firms.Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius L.L.P.has huge, and relatively ***recession**-proof, energy and employment practices.Others, like Cozen O'Connor P.C., have exploited core practice areas such as higher-end insurance work and litigation as a ***recession** backstop. Cozen and several other firms also benefited from the unraveling of Wolf, Block, Schorr &amp; Solis-Cohen L.L.P., scooping up dozens of its best lawyers along with their clients.The firm started the year with about 500 lawyers and is now at 550. Lately, it has been prospecting for additional office space in New York City, checking out the digs of failed law firms there to accommodate its plans to grow and benefit when the capital markets recover.One barometer of the relative optimism at Cozen: The firm said yesterday that it had made job offers to three-quarters of its small summer associate class.A similar dynamic has been playing out in London, also a financial-services center pummeled by the downturn.Reed Smith's London office, which has 300 lawyers, is the firm's largest, bigger even than its headquarters in Pittsburgh or its Philadelphia branch with about 150 attorneys. The economy is more problematic in the United Kingdom than in the United States because of the outsize impact of London's financial-services industry on the nation.Many U.S. law firms there are retrenching, but Pollack expects that Reed Smith will continue to have a large U.K. presence in anticipation of an eventual recovery. ""A lot of U.S. firms are downsizing. People are leaving,"" Pollack said. ""We're getting a lot of resumes.""Contact Chris Mondics at 215-854-5957 or cmondics@phillynews.com.",1,,,
288,4P9K-GKD0-TXDM-14B8-00000-00.txt,"LONDON - When Prime Minister Gordon Brown stepped into Tony Blair's shoes a month ago, his government signaled that the relationship with the Bush administration would be different - notably by appointing an outspoken critic of the Iraq war to his Cabinet.Today, Brown heads to Washington for a first face-to-face test of his relationship with President Bush, keen to smooth tensions over a perceived turn against the White House.The trip is Brown's first major overseas visit since he ended his 10-year wait to succeed Blair last month.He will hold talks with Bush at his Maryland retreat, Camp David, and deliver a speech to the United Nations in New York following talks with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.Brown must contend with inevitable comparisons to Blair. The former prime minister's close bonds with Bush and predecessor Bill Clinton won him admiration in the United States but cost him popularity at home, especially with regard to his decision to back the Iraq invasion.""We know that we cannot solve any of the world's major problems without the active engagement of the U.S.,"" Brown said in a statement Saturday night.""The relationship between an American president and a British prime minister will always be strong,"" he said. ""I am looking forward to my meeting with President Bush to discuss how we can work together to meet many of the great challenges we face.""White House press secretary Tony Snow said Thursday that Bush and Brown have a ""very special important relationship.""But some of Brown's first moves as premier raised eyebrows in Washington.He named Mark Malloch-Brown as junior foreign affairs minister. As deputy to ex-U.N. General Secretary Kofi Annan, Malloch-Brown had fierce spats with former U.S. ambassador John Bolton. Malloch-Brown has said Bush and Brown would not be ""joined at the hip,"" anther signal that Britain could be seeking some distance from Washington.British commentators also interpreted a speech in Washington by new International Development Secretary Douglas Alexander as a subtle critique of Bush's policies. Alexander called for end to a world in which ""a country's might was too often measured in what they could destroy.""""In the 21st century, strength should be measured by what we can build together,"" he said.Brown also offered a post to John Denham - an ex-minister who quit the government in 2003 in protest over Iraq.Brown's office denied a report in the Independent newspaper that Brown's visit had been rushed forward from a planned date in September to reassure Washington.In many ways, Brown knows the United States better than Blair. While Blair took family holidays in Italy and France, Brown prefers Cape Cod. Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, is a respected economic adviser to Brown.But Reginald Dale, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said it was unlikely Brown could recreate Blair's close relationship with Bush.""Most people here acknowledge things won't be the same,"" said Dale. ""It will be amicable, but not as intense as Bush's relationship with Blair, which was something quite unique.""While Bush and Blair were ""in tune, they were soulmates on the most important strategic and political issues of the day,"" Brown is likely to prove more cautious and pragmatic, Dale said.Brown arrives with some thorny issues in his policy folder, not least the fate of Britain's remaining soldiers in Iraq.Britain has 5,500 troops in the country, based almost entirely on the fringes of the southern city of Basra. Military chiefs in London have said Britain is likely to hand over control of Basra to local forces by the end of the year, a move certain to spark a domestic clamor for more British troop withdrawals.Brown will discuss with Bush Britain's likely role in aiding the U.S. plan to deploy a missile defense system in Europe, his Downing Street office said.Britain has said Menwith Hill, a U.S. military listening station in northern England, would be equipped with communications equipment enabling it to route satellite warnings about missile launches to British and American officials.Downing Street said the leaders would also examine a potential role for Britain in a Middle East peace conference in the U.S., which Bush has called and said would likely be held in September. They also will discuss the Iran nuclear controversy, the eventual status of Kosovo and the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, officials said.",0,,,
289,4V6P-S0D0-TX2G-N1MG-00000-00.txt,"In the past month, more than 300 people on the verge of eviction called Hope House. They needed help paying their rent, they said, just for a month or two, enough to catch up with their bills and avoid the street.Unfortunately, there was nothing left to give.In November 2007, the Louisiana Department of Social Services gave Unity of Greater New Orleans a $3.8 million grant. The money was dispersed to 11 agencies, including Hope House, to provide short- and long-term rental and utility assistance.The money helped more than 1,600 families avoid eviction, but the one-time grant expired at the end of October and the state has no plans to renew it.""It's a terrible feeling,"" said Hope House director Don Everard, who fields up to 10 calls a day from people desperately searching for a way to save their homes. ""We don't even take their names down anymore. We just check off the number of calls we get because there's no reason to think we can do anything for them. ""In a case of bad timing, the need for rental assistance picked up dramatically just as state-funded assistance expired, Everard said. In addition to the ***recession**, people are suffering from Hurricane Gustav's ripple effect. The cost of evacuating combined with the loss of at least a week's worth of work strained the budgets of many low-income families. Landlords may have allowed them to miss September or October's rent but now the bill is due and a large number of people are unable to pay.""For a lot of people in New Orleans, a ***recession** is nothing new,"" Everard said. ""They're in a perpetual ***recession**, living day to day and from one paycheck to the next. If they miss a couple weeks of work due to some crisis like a hurricane, it's unlikely they'll have something in the bank to hold them over where they can pay their rent and bills for the next couple of months. ""The majority of people calling for help are like Chastity Burns, a 30-year-old single mother of five who works in patient care at University Hospital. When Burns returned to New Orleans more than a year ago after evacuating to Dallas for Hurricane Katrina, she had no savings and couldn't afford an apartment.Burns went to Hope House and received several months' of assistance first for an apartment in the Lower Garden District for $700 a month and then for a $900 apartment in Gretna where she now lives.""Hope House was really a blessing for me and my kids. They let me get back on my feet,"" Burns said. ""Now I have enough money to pay my rent. The kids won't be able to get anything for Christmas, but I let them know we have to pay these bills otherwise we'll be homeless. I'm still living paycheck to paycheck. ""The threat of being evicted and ending up on the streets is a reality for thousands of New Orleanians such as Burns who live on the edge of financial ruin. Without the state rental assistance grant, there are few programs available to help them. And the newly homeless, people who have never before lived on the streets, avoid shelters like the plague, said Biaggio DiGiovanni, administrator of Ozanam Inn.""A lot of these people psychologically won't allow themselves to go into a shelter. They'll find an abandoned house or a car. They'd rather call that home then a shelter,"" DiGiovanni said.One reason is there are few shelters that allow men to stay with women, so families are typically split up. But the main reason the newly homeless avoid shelters is based on their misperceptions on what a shelter is.""A lot of people think a shelter is a horrible place filled with alcoholics and drug addicts, that it's one step above sleeping under the overpass,"" DiGiovanni said. ""For people who have lived in a house or apartment their entire lives, their heads are filled with these horror stories so they stay away. But they couldn't be further from the truth. ""The New Orleans Mission opened a $1.5 million family shelter in 2006 with six private rooms with bathrooms that can accommodate a mother and up to three children.But despite the growing need for family shelters, there was only one room occupied as of last week, said Linda Gonzales, New Orleans Mission assistant executive director.""One reason the other rooms are empty is because people don't know about us. But the main reason is that to most people whenever you mention a shelter, they think of the worst,"" Gonzales said. ""They have no idea that we offer private rooms, free food, washers and dryers. ""Shelters wouldn't be needed if people didn't lose their homes in the first place. And the best way to ensure that happens is through the renewal of the state rental assistance program, Everard said.""Our hope is that they see this problem is not going away, that more and more people are falling and in need of help. This program was an effective way to deal with it. It's proven itself and we have to keep this going. """,1,,,
290,7X9H-1D51-2R2Y-73WW-00000-00.txt,"c(""Dec. 12--Conservative legislator Greg Hughes was blown away recently when he attended a science class at an elementary school and watched students play violin notes to describe different types of rocks during a science instruction.Hughes, R-Draper, is chairman of the Conservative Caucus in the Utah House of Representatives and is strongly aligned with the no-new-tax, cut-spending philosophy of government.But he has been won over to a program funded by the Legislature two years ago to bring arts instruction to the state's elementary schools as a way to enhance students' learning in the core disciplines such as math, science and languages.That's why Hughes, usually one of the first lawmakers to sign on to spending cuts, opposed the slashing of four-year arts-in-education experiment as part of the Legislature's 17 percent spending cut last year to balance the listing state budget. Hughes sponsored the legislation two years ago to provide $15.8 million for arts instruction in 53 elementary schools. Each school had the choice of using the money to hire instructors in dance, music, theater or visual arts.But because of the ***economic downturn**, the Legislature had to find a way to balance an $876 million budget deficit in the last fiscal year. While the problem was eased by the $460 million Utah received in federal stimulus money, most programs took drastic hits, including a 37 percent cut in the arts program.So what originally was to be aprogram funded for four years to see what difference the arts made in students' progress in core subjects is about to end in its second year. Principals in the participating schools have sent letters to parents to let them know that unless the money is restored in the upcoming legislative session, the arts program will cease at the end of this school year.National studies have shown a link between arts instruction and higher achievement in core curriculum. In some cases graduation rates have been four times higher among students who have had classes in music, dance, theater or visual arts.The Utah program was inspired by Beverly Taylor Sorenson, the widow of billionaire philanthropist James L. Sorenson. She founded Artworks for Kids several years ago and was instrumental in getting the Legislature to fund the program in schools.\""What Beverly Sorenson has done is marry the rigor of academics with art,\"" Hughes told me. \""I believe this program has found a link between the arts and academic performance. It's a way to close the achievement gap. We've seen that attendance has increased. Kids are enjoying school more.\""Hughes said that because the original funding was one-time funding, \""It never should have been part of the budget cuts.\""Yet the Legislature is now looking at an additional $150 million to $200 million in cuts to balance the current fiscal year budget, so restoring the funding and keeping the program going may be an uphill battle.Linda Cluff, director of Friends of Artworks for Kids, said her group has been visiting schools to generate support for continuing the program. She says 8,000 parents so far have contacted the group's Web site offering support.Whether that is enough to persuade a stingy Legislature, whose members have long called for a more core-curriculum-based regimen and fewer \""frills,\"" to come up with funding for the arts in the midst of an ongoing budget crisis remains to be seen.Even Hughes, a longtime leader in the \""no-frills\"" movement, may not have the clout to save a program he is convinced will save money in the long run be improving academics and graduation rates.And that would be a shame.To see more of The Salt Lake Tribune, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.sltrib.com.

If anything, it only deepened their commitment to bring back the Revue next summer.\""We're going to try like heck to have the Revue back next year,\"" general manager Kevin O'Connor said. \""We think it's really good for our organization and our fans.\""I thinkin the middle of July, without pro football and Major League Baseball, that it gives our fans an opportunity to really come out and see the players.\""The Jazz credited the Orlando league with being well-run, although it offered limited facilities compared with the Revue and Salt Lake Community College. As coach Jerry Sloan put it: \""The overall picture [with the Revue] seems to be better.\""As much as it was a source of pride to the Jazz, the Revue was doomed by competition from a rival league in Las Vegas, as well as by the economy, which left teams playing in fewer leagues -- or in some cases, not fielding teams at all.The Jazz remain \""unequivocally\"" opposed to going to Las Vegas, according to O'Connor, both outof frustration at their own league's demise and the belief that the environment along the Strip is the wrong introduction for players entering the NBA.\""The things that I've heard of and things that have happened, guys being in the casinos with their practice stuff on or their game stuff on,\"" Sloan said. \""I don't know, is that something you want to accomplish with young guys?\""Added Sloan: \""We have a tough enough time trying to keep the image going in the right direction.\""Even so, Orlando represented a dramatically different setting than the Revue.

How many guys have been stars before they've ever played an NBA game? ... It's good for them to be out on the road.\""There wasn't even an announcer to call out baskets, fouls and substitutions. The Orlando league has held one public game in its history -- LeBron James' debut -- but the overall belief is that keeping out fans makes for better working conditions.The viewing options, however, are limited for the public, with the Magic broadcasting the games on the Internet only, though one team official said Orlando's Web site was receiving as much traffic during the summer league as the NBA Finals.Unlike the Revue, which scheduled off days after back-to-back games, the Orlando league left the Jazz to play five games in five days. The Jazz held two-a-day practices before their first game, but had no practice time once play began.While they could use their own practice facility for the Revue, the Jazz had fewer options in Orlando and ended up using another court at the Sportsplex. The Jazz also dressed at their hotel and returned immediately after games, with limited locker-room facilities.\""That's more like the NBA used to be,\"" Sloan said. \""It didn't hurt anybody.

292,4SHK-63S0-TX31-W0RY-00000-00.txt,"WASHINGTON -- Unemployment is rising faster among Hispanics than the rest of the U.S. population as the economy slows, a development that has ripple effects across the nation and into Latin America.The steep, continuing U.S. housing downturn has had a disproportionate impact on the Hispanic workforce, which is highly concentrated in construction. Because homeownership is also the major source of wealth for Latino families, falling house prices have made it harder for small-business owners to use their residences as collateral for needed loans to run or expand their firms.Further, the weakening job market, and state and federal crackdowns on illegal immigrants, have reduced the number of Hispanics wiring money to Latin America. Millions of families who depend on so-called remittance payments could be pushed into poverty if current trends continue, according to the Inter-American Development Bank.The U.S. Hispanic unemployment rate jumped to 6.9% in April from 5.5% in April 2007. The African-American unemployment rate is higher, at 8.6%, but has risen less sharply in the past year. The white jobless rate was 4.4% in April.Housing market implosion takes a tollThe impact of rising unemployment is being felt at the Southern Nevada Hispanic Employment Program in Las Vegas, which offers about 150 scholarships annually for higher education, along with other job-related assistance.About 60% of those seeking scholarships through the program are older students who have been in the workforce, many in real estate jobs that have disappeared.""We're out there trying to hustle"" for additional funding, says Leslie Valdez, president of the program. ""Because of the economic situation, a lot of people got laid off from work. Everybody was a Realtor; everybody was a loan officer.""The housing bust and rising foreclosures have other economic impacts. Hard-hit lenders are setting tougher terms for products from home-equity to business loans. That's especially hard on the Hispanic population, where workers may have sporadic work histories and often don't have traditional credit scores.""Rising credit constraints have had an impact on small businesses,"" says David Ferreira, vice president for government relations at the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. ""Hispanics have a higher rate of using home equity or credit cards for financing a business or expanding a business.""The Hispanic homeownership rate had risen to nearly 50% before the housing bubble burst.Still, the picture isn't uniformly bleak. Latino workers with professional degrees, particularly in professions such as nursing, are in high demand. Companies want bilingual workers in order to reach out to the rapidly growing Hispanic market, as well as to meet internal needs.""We haven't seen a decline in companies recruiting; there hasn't been a decline in the number of job positions,"" says Rob Steward, sales director at LatPro, an online employment site for Hispanic professionals. LatPro is working with the National Society for Hispanic Professionals to put together nine job fairs around the country this year.""Major (companies), small and everyone in between (are) still recruiting for the skill set these workers provide,"" Steward says.At the same time, official employment statistics may not fully reflect conditions in the Hispanic community. Because millions of Latino workers are in the country illegally, they may not show up in government data. They also have a smaller safety net during ***economic downturn**s.Eligible Hispanics collect federal benefits such as food stamps at lower rates than other population groups, and are more likely than whites to lack health coverage. States that are forced to pare back budgets often cut health care to legal immigrants before trimming other health care programs, says Catherine Singley of the National Council of La Raza, a non-profit advocacy group.Many not eligible for benefitsPolitical efforts to aid the unemployed are not always well tailored to the Hispanic community. One such case: Congress will soon debate a measure to extend unemployment benefits for laid-off workers who have already exhausted their initial six months of coverage.""For the Latino community, (an extension) is not very effective because not many are eligible for unemployment"" assistances, Singley says.Many states require a certain level of wages or ""consistent work history, and that just isn't a reality for a lot of workers who are either working on a contractual basis or taking odd jobs, day laborers. That describes a lot of Hispanic workers.""An Inter-American Development Bank poll of 5,000 Latin Americans living in the USA earlier this year found just 50% were sending regular payments back home to their families, down from 73% in 2006. Those sending money are sending greater amounts, but it's reaching fewer families.""The ***economic downturn** after Sept. 11 was more pronounced and yet remittances were not adversely affected,"" says Don Terry, a senior official at the bank.""When you combine the ***economic slowdown** with an increasing sense of uncertainty and, in some cases, fear about your future ... you sort of hunker down, even though the higher priority that you have is to send money home after you pay the rent.""

293,4RY2-F5P0-TX12-N0P2-00000-00.txt,"c(""Feb. 28--Kansas University's bus system operating budget is in the red, to the tune of nearly $320,000.At Wednesday night's Student Senate meeting, senators approved legislation that would allow the KU on Wheels bus system to transfer $3 per student from the bus acquisition fee to the bus operation fee. Students pay $36 per semester to KU on Wheels -- $16 for operations and $20 for new bus purchases.While the fee change will not affect the amount students pay, it will reduce this year's operating deficit by about $141,000.\""It's so we can continue to have the same levels of service you've had all year,\"" transportation coordinator May Davis told senators.When combined with profits from last year's operations, reallocating the $3 allows the bus system to reduce the deficit to $62,000. Danny Kaiser, associate director of parking and transit at KU, said the bus system must pay off the deficit this year.\""If there's nothing else, we can go in to the transit reserve fund,\"" Kaiser said.The reserve fund currently has $400,000 in it, though it is already lower than Kaiser would like. Kaiser said the bus system, which generated a profit last year, was hit with budget problems this year because it is the first year of a new contract.The bus system originally expected to pay in the neighborhood of $1.5 million to operate this year; however, the bid from MV Transportation came in at $2 million. MV Transportation provides bus service to the city of Lawrence and began providing KU's bus service this year.\""Whenever we're in the first year of a new contract, we're shooting blind,\"" Kaiser said. \""Fuel prices also keep going up and we're feeling that.\""So while revenue has increased about $280,000 this year, higher prices quickly eliminated the extra revenue.While the budget deficit will be paid off this year, the red ink will remain next year unless more money is raised or operating expenses are reduced.\""The options are look for more economies, look for other sources of revenue or reduce service,\"" Kaiser said. \""Those options are what we'll be looking at the rest of the spring semester.\""Kaiser said there's already a nearly $3 increase in the student transportation fee planned for next year.He also said that the city and university have asked for joint transportation proposals beginning Jan. 1, 2009, which he hopes will reduce the costs both entities have to pay. While the systems will still operate separately, the provider would be able to share management, operations and other expenses. Kaiser also said the new contract would be for five years, allowing better revenue and expense planning.The proposal approved Wednesday night does come with drawbacks. KU on Wheels will have to slow down the rate at which it purchases new buses. While KU did get \""new\"" buses this year, all were previously used, some for more than 20 years.Kaiser said the fee transfer would slow down the rate of new bus purchases, but ultimately the bus system would catch up and complete purchasing of new buses as scheduled.To see more of the Journal-World, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.ljworld.com/.

Economists were looking for another 1.5% decrease in March.Annual decline in house prices was 15.7% in March compared to 17.6% drop in February. This brought the price of a typical house to GBP 150,946. House prices dropped by less than the annual 18.1% decline expected by economists.Fionnuala Earley, Nationwide&amp;apos;s Chief Economist said, ""Spring brought a surprise bounce to house prices in March."" The moderation in the annual rate of fall was somewhat distorted by conditions last year, and so it would be unwise to draw strong conclusions from the significant slowdown in the annual rate of fall. Though increase in house prices is welcome, it is too early to consider this as evidence of house price recovery.The Bank of England took bold measures of quantitative easing and substantial rate cuts. According to mortgage lender, it will take time for the measures taken by the central bank to work through into the housing market before they can expect sustained recovery in house prices.Policymakers of the Bank of England had voted unanimously to reduce the interest rate by 50 basis points to a historical low of 0.5% in March.Mortgage approvals also improved in February to a nine month high. The number of mortgages approved for house purchases totaled 37,937 in February compared to 31,791 in January, the BoE report showed earlier.In the first quarter, house prices were down 4.2% sequentially, slower than the 4.7% decline in the last three months of 2008, the Nationwide reported. House prices plummeted 16.5% annually to GBP149,709 in the first quarter.The mortgage lenders noted that Northern Ireland reported first moderation in price fall in two years. While, Scotland experienced sharp fall in prices during the first quarter, Wales witnessed biggest quarterly fall across the whole of the UK.

The city also will try to estimate more accurately the cost of projects before they are given budget approval.Additionally, the city plans to keep a central data bank of all information about construction bids and to build on recent changes in the state Legislature that allow the city to preapprove contractors and give more construction projects to single contractors.The president of the New York Building Congress, which represents several leading construction firms, Richard Anderson, said he welcomed the initiative. ""City government needs to find ways to make projects more contractor-friendly,"" he said.While housing values have dropped throughout much of the country, values in many parts of the city have held steady. Mr. Bloomberg said the ""perpetual motion"" of the recent building boom could not last forever but that rising costs are making construction projects more and more difficult to complete.The mayor also pointed to today's ""dire"" economic climate as a reason for the reforms. ""The current ***economic downturn** has been and will continue to be difficult for New York City,"" he said. ""It has forced us to do something that is a very good practice for any organization: to look at our costs and see where we can do things better and more efficiently.""Even if the city cannot stop inflation, it can help cut unnecessary costs, Mr. Anderson said. ""Getting a grip on rising construction costs doesn't have any one solution,"" he said. ""But we want government to be aware of what it can do.""The New York Building Congress is expected to issue a report on the inflation of construction costs tomorrow.",1,,,

He enjoys what he is doing, including running a family-owned shuttle service that supplements the income for his wife and him.The reality is that keeping the business profitable and making ends meet has become an increasing challenge, he said.\""It's tough,\"" Collins said. \""It's time consuming. We're comfortable, though, because it fits us.\""Collins started the business in 2002 after being laid off from his job as a tire builder at Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., where he worked for 22 years. He has since found a job at Caterpillar Inc. working third shift. His wife, Becky, who helped him start the shuttle service, currently works as a teaching assistant at Parsons School.\""It's a nice side business,\"" Becky Collins said. \""It's nothing where we have to punch in.\""The shuttle service has added another aspect to their life that they continue to enjoy. They bring customers door to door to destinations, including Chicago, St. Louis, Peoria, Indianapolis and Madison, Wis. Their home office overlooks Lake Decatur, and they can get trips organized while being at home with their two grandchildren, ages 3 and 1.The trips, mostly getting customers to airports, can be scheduled as needed. The fleet now includes a Chevrolet Blazer and Ford Mustang.\""People like to see your face when they come out of the airport,\"" Collins said. \""It puts them at ease.

Too many discounts cut into their profit, Becky Collins said.\""I'm afraid to do it right now because the price of gas could go back up,\"" Steve Collins said.Collins was 45 days away from being eligible for retirement when he lost his Firestone job.

Thomas Wells Jr. said Wednesday in Oklahoma City.Wells addressed an effort this legislative session to make payment of Oklahoma Bar Association dues voluntary, because the OBA may lobby on issues with which some members disagree.He said that increased regulation of attorneys is a threat to lawyer independence, because sometimes, ""regulation becomes overregulation. """"The issue of interference with the bar association, whether it's the legislative or executive branches of state government, are a bit like weeds in a garden,"" he said. ""They pop up here or there, whether you want them to or not. ""Wells said he always tries to point out the interrelationship between an independent bar and a fair and impartial judiciary.""In my view, things like that, like additional state regulation of lawyers, is a threat to lawyer independence, because one of the primary functions of lawyers is to stand up to government and hold government accountable to the rule of law,"" he said. ""At some point, regulation becomes overregulation, because if lawyers can no longer stand up to the government, then you end up with the situation, like in some places in Russia, where you hear about 'telephone justice. '""Wells said that refers to the situation that exists in some places in that country, where after a judge hears a case, he must call government officials to ask how they want him to decide a particular matter.Wells said the bar association in his home state of Alabama is lobbying on judicial selection issues.The ABA itself is a voluntary association, which, Wells said, may lobby on more than 100 issues in any given year, issues on which its House of Delegates has adopted policies.For example, Wells said the ABA is proud to have played a key part in securing a $40 million increase in funding over the past year for the Legal Services Corporation, which funds groups that provide legal help for low-income individuals.The ABA has scheduled a summit in May on the issue of fair and impartial state courts, which Wells said came about during his travels as president-elect, listening to concerns raised by bar leaders, judges and lawyers.""It occurred to me that the one theme that was coming back is, to one level or another, they were all threats to fair and impartial state courts,"" Wells said.He said those concerns ranged from what he termed a ""jail for judges"" initiative on the ballot in South Dakota to a Colorado initiative that would have severely term-limited judges and efforts in other states aimed at the way judges are selected.Wells said a key threat to the judiciary, which was almost universal in his meetings, was the negative effects of inadequate funding of the courts.""So, a good portion of our summit is going to talk about inter-branch relations, among the branches of state government,"" he said.Wells said it is more important than ever to be able to explain the importance of the courts and their existence as a third branch of government, with fewer state governors and legislators coming from the legal profession.""On both the civil and the criminal sides, if you don't give them adequate resources to do their job, we're going to have a hard time delivering the rule of law that the American people have come to expect,"" he said.Wells was in Oklahoma Wednesday visiting with legal groups, including Legal Aid Services of Oklahoma, to discuss issues facing attorneys across the country. He has been traveling the country speaking with state and local bar groups since his year as president-elect.""It's always informative,"" he said. ""I always learn something. ""Wells said he tries to include a visit with local legal aid providers wherever he goes and to stress the importance of the work they do.""Obviously, access to justice is one of the real core values, I think, of the legal profession,"" he said. ""In these economic times, it's even more important than ever. ""Wells said people have more legal problems during the ***recession**, although resources to address them are less.""It's more than just problem solving,"" he said of legal aid's work. ""A lot of times, it's problem avoiding. ""During hard economic times, Wells said, people may first need a financial intervention, which can help keep them from spiraling down into needing more and more government services.""It really is a financial savings, not just for the individual involved, but for society as a whole, if we can get a lawyer involved in a situation earlier rather than later,"" he said.",0,,,
298,4VHP-VM80-TX12-N0WN-00000-00.txt,"c(""Feb. 2--City commissioners will talk Tuesday afternoon and decide Tuesday night on whether to back a loan-and-tax-credit plan to build a downtown parking garage, seen as vital to continuing a huge redevelopment project in the face of a national ***recession**.Backers of the redevelopment had planned to sell bonds for the garage and surrounding commercial and residential space, designed to complement the city-financed minor league baseball stadium now under construction. But bond buyers won't touch the project in today's economic climate, so a new plan was arranged: a complicated series of loan exchanges between bank-connected investment funds, the nonprofit corporation formed to oversee redevelopment, and a new sister corporation created just for this purpose. Those loans would allow developers access to enough tax credits to pay for a reduced garage, cut from a planned 821 spaces to 430.The downtown corporation, Warren County and city government all have to approve the idea, as they're partners in the overall downtown plan. The corporation and county have done so already, but commissioners refused last week to approve it on learning that it would require redirecting another $251,000 a year from tax revenue in the redevelopment area to make loan interest payments.Commissioners said they wanted more time to study all relevant documents, ask more questions and get assurances from the intended recipients of that tax money that they would give up the revenue until their own construction projects began. The money in question was planned to help finance an enlarged Graves-Gilbert Clinic and a joint project between Western Kentucky University's nursing program and The Medical Center. At least some of those groups have said they'll surrender a few years of funding if that will keep the project going, in hopes that their own project bonds can be issued when financial markets improve.A discussion of the loan plan is scheduled for commissioners' 4 p.m. nonvoting work session, and a proposed ordinance to approve it is the last item on the agenda for the 7 p.m. regular meeting.Fire station bidA $2.6 million bid from Scott, Murphy &amp; Daniel to renovate the main city fire station and build a new administrative office is up for approval. The city budgeted $3.2 million for the project, but all bids exceeded that by several hundred thousand dollars, according to a memo from Fire Chief Greg Johnson. The city negotiated with the three lowest bidders, and plans to buy all materials directly. Those changes have cut the price by nearly $1 million, Johnson said.A description of the changes is scheduled for the 4 p.m. work session, with the bid vote at the 7 p.m. meeting.Navajo closingAfter four years of debate, commissioners are poised Tuesday night to permanently close Navajo Drive access to the Shawnee Estates neighborhood.The first reading of an ordinance to sever Navajo Drive between the corner of Geronimo Way and Navajo's intersection with Patton Way and Fields Drive is on the meeting agenda.The street has been blocked since 2005, after residents complained of heavy and fast cut-through traffic from large new apartment complexes nearby. Since then, traffic-calming devices have been installed on Shawnee and a new outlet for apartment residents -- Fields Drive -- has been built. Whether to permanently cut the street has divided the neighborhood; in November, commissioners declined to do new traffic studies on the street.According to City Attorney Gene Harmon, all four property owners immediately adjacent to the closure point have given consent.ITA boardSix city appointments to the board that runs the Kentucky TriModal Transpark are up for approval. City Manager Kevin DeFebbo, Warren Rural Electric Cooperative Corp. President Gary Dillard, former Mayor Johnny Webb and businessmen Jim Dinning and Harold McGuffey are slated for reappointment to new four-year terms, while former City Manager Chuck Coates is to be named to the unexpired term of Jimmie Gipson, who resigned.

299,4VGD-S0H0-TW8F-G1NV-00000-00.txt,"The stimulus bill working its way through Congress is not just a package of spending increases and tax cuts intended to jolt the nation out of ***recession**. For Democrats, it is also a tool for rewriting the social contract with the poor, the uninsured and the unemployed, in ways they have long yearned to do.   With little notice and no public hearings, House Democrats would create a temporary new entitlement allowing workers getting unemployment checks to qualify for Medicaid, the health program for low-income people. Spouses and children could also receive benefits, no matter how much money the family had.   In addition, the stimulus package would offer a hefty subsidy to help laid-off workers retain the same health plans they had from their former employers.   Altogether, the economic recovery bill would speed $127 billion over the next two and a half years to individuals and states for health care alone, a fact that has Republicans fuming that the stimulus package is a back door to universal health coverage.  ''It's raining money,'' said Representative Michael C. Burgess, Republican of Texas.  The House plans to vote Wednesday on the $825 billion bill, and the Senate is expected to vote on a similar measure next week.  As Congress rushes to inject cash into a listless economy, it is setting aside many of the restraints that have checked new domestic spending for more than a decade. The White House said the changes contemplated by Congress would provide coverage for nearly 8.5 million newly uninsured people who had lost their jobs and would protect Medicaid for many more whose eligibility would otherwise be at risk.  Of the $127 billion cost, the Congressional Budget Office said, $87 billion would be used to increase the federal share of Medicaid, $29 billion would subsidize private insurance and $11 billion would finance Medicaid for unemployed workers who could not otherwise qualify.   Most of the aid is billed as temporary. But Republicans fear that states would get hooked on it, just as they might grow accustomed to a big increase in federal aid to education, also included in the bill.  Democrats said the current ***economic crisis** did not allow time for public hearings on the legislation.  ''This is as urgent as it gets,'' said Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California.  After the House Ways and Means Committee approved its piece of the economic recovery legislation last Thursday, Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, said, ''We accomplished more today than in the last eight years.''  Congressional Democrats developed the package in close consultation with President Obama. Health care provisions of the bill taking shape in the Senate are broadly similar to those in the House bill, though they may prove less expensive. Obama aides and advisers said the president would insist on health insurance assistance for the unemployed as part of a final bill, which he wants to sign by mid-February.  The legislation would allow states to provide Medicaid to an entirely new group: those who are receiving unemployment insurance benefits, their spouses and children under 19.  Medicaid is normally for low-income people, and for decades it has been financed jointly by the federal government and the states, with the federal share averaging 57 percent of costs.   The economic stimulus bill prevents states from enforcing a means test, saying, ''No income or resources test shall be applied with respect to any category of individuals'' who become eligible for Medicaid because they are receiving unemployment benefits. The federal government would pay 100 percent of the costs for people enrolled under this option through December 2010.  Republicans said this proposal would take a big step toward federalizing Medicaid. For their part, Democrats said the changes took a major step toward their goal of coverage for all Americans.   At the same time, the legislation would provide a huge measure of fiscal relief to state Medicaid programs, at a time when state revenues are declining and the number of Medicaid recipients is rising because of the ***recession**.  The federal share of Medicaid spending now ranges from 50 percent in higher-income states like New York and Connecticut to more than 73 percent in poor states like Mississippi and West Virginia. Under the House bill, the federal share would be increased by at least 4.9 percentage points in every state, and by much more in states with large increases in unemployment.  The bill would also offer a lifeline to workers who have lost health insurance along with  their jobs. In theory, such workers and their families can keep their group health benefits for 18 months under a federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, known as Cobra. But laid-off workers are often required to pay 102 percent of the full premium, including the employer's share, so the cost now can be prohibitive.  Under the bill, the federal government would pay 65 percent of the premiums for a year. That subsidy would almost surely increase the number of laid-off workers choosing to continue coverage.  Republicans wanted to deny the premium subsidies to people who had annual incomes of more than $100,000 or assets of more than $1 million. They also wanted to prevent people with more than $1 million of family income from taking advantage of the Medicaid option for the unemployed.  Democrats voted down those proposals in the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.  Representative Nathan Deal, Republican of Georgia, said ''the poorest of the poor'' had long been subject to income and asset tests when applying for Medicaid. But, Mr. Deal argued, under the new option, a millionaire could get Medicaid benefits, financed entirely by the federal government, without being asked about such matters.  The committee chairman, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, said, ''It's highly unlikely that you are going to find millionaires who would like to go on Medicaid.''  Moreover, Mr. Waxman said, the purpose of the new options is to ''streamline the enrollment process'' and speed assistance to people who are unemployed.  ''It's going to set up an unnecessary barrier if we have any income test,'' Mr. Waxman said, adding that the enforcement of a means test could require ''a whole new bureaucracy.''  The bill would also create a new option for people 55 or older and for those who have worked for the same employer for 10 years or more. They could retain health benefits under Cobra, at their own expense, until they became eligible for Medicare at 65 or obtained coverage through another job. Under this option, employers said, younger workers could conceivably hold onto their coverage for decades.  In a joint letter to Congress, the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Retail Federation opposed this proposal, saying it would drive up costs for workers already covered by employer health plans.   ''The people who sign up for unsubsidized coverage under the new option are more likely to have serious medical conditions and therefore to increase the cost of employee health care disproportionately,'' said E. Neil Trautwein, a vice president of the National Retail Federation.  If states wanted the federal government to pay a larger share of Medicaid, they would have to maintain current eligibility levels and could not adopt more restrictive criteria. But states could reduce benefits or payments to health care providers.  Representative Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said he feared that such cuts would make it more difficult for Medicaid recipients to find doctors in some parts of the country.",1,,,

They say the number of booked conventions is still good, but they worry that business and tourist travel may not be as robust as in the past because of the downturn in the economy.And most say that until the industry gets a clearer picture of whether the country is headed toward a prolonged ***recession**, new hotels probably won't break ground for a while.""The level of economic uncertainty is causing a lot of people to rethink their strategy and where they are in the marketplace,"" said Mark Woodworth, executive vice president of PKF Consulting, an Atlanta firm that tracks the health of the hotel industry.""However, they are not abandoning the projects,"" he said. ""They are pausing.""Accommodations are important to Atlanta. Tourism is a more than $11 billion industry in the metro area, and Atlanta is one of the nation's biggest convention and business cities.While metro Atlanta has one of the nation's largest supplies of hotel rooms --- about 93,000 --- most are in the suburbs. To compete with cities such as Chicago, Las Vegas and Orlando, more rooms are needed inside the Perimeter to handle conventions and visitors to the World of Coca-Cola, the High Museum of Art and Buckhead restaurants.Hotels announced in Atlanta over the past few years include new brands and well-regarded standbys, such as a Grand Bohemian Hotel in the Perimeter area, the Stanbury in Alpharetta, a Staybridge Suites downtown, and lodging by Hilton, Baccarat Hotel and Residences and 1 Hotel and Residences in Buckhead. Others being speculated about but not yet official include a Mandarin Oriental, a third Ritz-Carlton, a Waldorf-Astoria and a Trump hotel at the billionaire's condo project in Midtown.If realized, they will join a number of first-of-their-kind nameplates in Atlanta, such as St. Regis, Rosewood, Loews and Palomar, all under construction or nearing completion. Starwood, owner of the W brand, is building a new hotel downtown and reflagging properties in Buckhead and Midtown. A second Hotel Indigo from InterContinental Hotels Group, which operates the Holiday Inn, InterContinental and Crowne Plaza brands, is being developed at the old Carnegie Building downtown.Paul Breslin, managing partner of Panther Hospitality, said Atlanta is still ripe for development, but capital has tightened. What would have been green-lighted a year ago is now being scrutinized more thoroughly.""There is a tremendous need for banks to make money,"" he said. ""What's different is they are being more selective of the projects.""Timing also is crucial.Beau King, developer of the 304-room Palomar in Midtown, said it would not have been as easy to get the boutique off the ground in today's climate.""I think it would have been a big problem,"" he said. ""Underwriting is getting a lot harder. Everyone is pulling back.""As it is, the Palomar had to strip the condo component from its original plan after the housing market tanked.""There is certainly a palpable chill in construction right now,"" King said.Still, Woodworth doesn't see the hotel industry falling into the same chasm as the housing market.""There is absolutely no depression in hotel values like we have seen in other parts of the real estate market,"" he said. The first half of this year is going to be tough. The second half is going to be much, much better.""Mike Sullivan, a spokesman for the Omni at CNN Center, also is optimistic. He said the rush to build new hotels in Atlanta says a lot more about the market than the time it's taking to get the deals done.""The good thing is a lot of people are looking at Atlanta as a good market,"" Sullivan said.HOSPITALITY'S IMPACT$11 billion: Value of Atlanta's hospitality industry93,000: Number of hotel rooms in metro Atlanta",1,,,

Despite hundreds of billions of dollars in bad mortgages that have demanded a government bailout, and a housing market that is depressed just about everywhere in the country, Mortech is not only surviving, it's thriving. Founder and owner Don Kracl said there are a couple of reasons. For one, Kracl said Mortech did very little business with subprime lenders who issue risky mortgages to people with questionable credit and who largely have been responsible for the country's mortgage troubles. \""The implosion of the subprime business has been a plus for us,\"" Kracl said. \""The prime market is really our space.\"" The prime market - more traditional, fixedrate mortgages - is the other big reason for Mortech's continued success.Because of all the mortgage defaults and foreclosures, lending standards have tightened significantly over the past year, leading to new sets of requirements for lenders.\""The business has just become much more fluid and complex even though there are fewer (mortgage) products,\"" Kracl saidThat has led to a demand for Mortech's products, which allow lenders to plug dozens or even hundreds of variables into a computer and receive an accurate rate quote in seconds.Kracl said Mortech's annual growth rate over the past few years has been about 40 percent, a number the company is on track to hit again this year.In the past year, he said his staff has grown from 15 to 25, and the company is putting the finishing touches on a renovation and expansion of its building in the Lincoln Trade Center that will give it room to grow to about 50 people.Much of Mortech's growth has been spurred by its deal with well-known online lender LendingTree.As part of the deal, signed last October, Mortech provided LendingTree clients access to one of its software programs, called Marksman.Initially, the deal only involved LendingTree customers that were already Mortech customers, but at the time Kracl said he was optimistic about growing the number of users.Renee Harvey, Mortech's marketing director, said the company has grown its LendingTree customer base by more than 450 percent.There's a reason for that, said Allen Cravello, president of American Capital Corp. in El Segundo, Calif., a longtime Mortech customer and more recent client of LendingTree.\""The increase in Mortech's client base is directly related to its commitment of upholding its promises to new and old customers alike,\"" Cravello said. \""Mortech isn't just talking about what they can do, they're actually doing it.\""Among the things the company has done recently is create a couple of new products for LendingTree and introduce a mobile version of its Marksman software.Kracl said one of the reasons Mortech has been so successful with LendingTree is the nature of Internet lending.Customers aren't going into an office during business hours to get a mortgage quote. Instead they are going online late at night or on weekends, he said.\""It would be too expensive for you to have personnel available to respond to offer requests at 3 in the morning,\"" Kracl said.Sylvia Yanes, LendingTree manager at AmericaHomeKey Inc. in Dallas, said the firm was searching for a solution to do some work and allow employees to concentrate on borrowers.After becoming a Marksman customer, \""we've had more time to focus on our customers and have seen increases in the number of deals we're closing,\"" she said.It's not just customers that have been happy with Mortech's products.\""Over the past years, Mortech has simplified the loan closing process for our network lenders who choose to use Mortech,\"" said Loudoun Emswiler, senior director of lender technology for LendingTree. \""They have delivered a complete solution, all while consistently providing quality service.\""LendingTree has been so happy, in fact, that earlier this month it presented Mortech with an award that is given out only sparingly.At the 10th annual LendingTree Partner Summit at the company's corporate headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., Chairman and CEO Doug Lebda presented Mortech with the Rick Stiegler Innovator of the Year award, named for the company's founding chief technology officer and one of its first employees. Lebda died in 2004.\""The Innovator of the Year award is an important way for us to recognize a partner whose hard work and determination follow the same suit as Rick's,\"" Lebda said. \""Mortech jumped at the opportunity to create a new technology that helps our lender partners improve their business efficiency and accuracy ...\""Kracl said the award, which LendingTree doesn't give out every year, was a complete surprise.\""I was speechless,\"" he said. \""And everybody here will tell you that's a rarity.\""Reach Matt Olberding at 473-2647 or molberding@journalstar.com"", 
""Mortech, a Lincoln company, won a LendingTree award named for LendingTree's founding chief technology officer Rick Stiegler, who died in 2004. In a story on Page 1E of Sunday's Journal Star, the deceased was misidentified as LendingTree CEO Doug Lebda, who is still alive."")",1,,,

Look for a postcard, not a letter, unless you own more than one piece of real estate, Assessor Ralph Baker advised. Baker said his office will save about $20,000 by substituting postcards for letters. ""We'll see how the public takes it, but it seems to be going fine,"" he said Friday. Assessed values are up about 14 percent throughout the county, compared with an increase of approximately 16 percent last year, Baker said. ""I don't know that you'd even call it a slowdown,"" he said. ""That's not much difference."" The county's economy remains ""vibrant,"" with no slowdown in home sales and only a slight reduction in building permits, Baker said. He speculated that the amount of value added to the county's tax base will be more like the $779 million added in 2005 than last year's $1 billion, but he noted this year's final calculation hadn't been made. Property values are rising throughout the county, he added. The increases don't necessarily mean individual property tax bills will be going up. Assessed values are just one factor in tax bills. Other factors are the amount of government spending and the number of people splitting the tab. Baker urged residents who want more information about how tax bills are computed to read his Web site at  www.spokanecounty.org/assessor. The site has a wealth of information, including advice on how to improve your chances of winning an appeal if you disagree with your assessment, he said. ""It's that transparency-in-government thing,"" Baker said. ""We want to make sure you see what we're doing."" As a new feature, the site contains almost all the sketches and other information from the now-archived field books that appraisers used in the past to record their observations. Other online information - searchable by address or parcel number - includes current appraisal and tax information for each property as well as a photograph. For those who don't receive or who lose their assessment notices, a digital copy is available online. The cards have contact information for the appraisers who handled the property in question, and the Web site adds a direct e-mail link to the appraiser. Baker said he encourages people who have questions or concerns about their appraisals to get in touch with their appraiser, or with him if the appraiser doesn't respond within five days. ""The best way is by e-mail because that way we have a written record,"" Baker said.",0,,,

But this year, instead of budgeting to replace a couple of units that already have around 90,000 miles, the city is asking that the departments put a few more miles on them, he said.Another way Haines has created savings in next year's budget is by \""push(ing) a few things back into this year's budget,\"" which he said the city has been \""in the habit of doing the past few years.\""Haines and Riffel explained that when the ***economic crisis** began to reach a head this past fall, they shut down capital purchases throughout city departments in order to save what money they could for the coming year.This is something that the city typically does every year about nine months into the Fiscal Year, Riffel said, noting that this year it was done only five to six months in.By doing it so early, they not only created resources for next year, but there is still some revenue available to the various departments to make important purchases this year.In addition to being frugal as far as expenses, Haines noted that the FY 2009-2010 budget also takes a frugal stance with regard to income.He explained that the budget has been based on an anticipated five percent decrease in tax revenue.This could be a positive or a negative, he said, because if the economy improves and sales tax receipts begin to increase again, that would mean more money for the city to work with. However, he said if the city actually experiences a 10 percent decrease in tax revenue, the budget would have to be readjusted to be even more frugal and perhaps dip farther into reserves.Nevertheless, both Haines and Riffel remained optimistic about the budget and noted that Woodward is in a better budgetary circumstance than other cities throughout the state and even the state itself.For example, Riffel noted that Tulsa is making layoffs and handing out furloughs, while \""the state is facing a $600 million deduction and that's with stimulus money.\""However, in the next year Woodward should continue to see progress through ongoing work at Crystal Beach and beginning work on the new conference center, the city manager said.In fact, city commissioners are expected to consider service agreements related to the conference center during their regular meeting Monday evening.However, the budget will be the major item for consideration during the meeting. But before the commissioners vote on whether to approve the budget, a public hearing will be held to allow for public comment about the budget.Also on the agenda for both the public hearing and the city commission meeting is discussion about the possible demolition of a building at 1001 8th St. which was damaged by the late spring snow and which the owners have yet to do anything about despite letters from code enforcement.The public hearing will begin at 7 p.m. Monday in the Commission Room of City Hall with the city commission meeting to immediately follow.To see more of The Woodward News or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://woodwardnews.net.

Pickups and SUVs go about 18 miles on a gallon of gasoline, on average, compared to about 23 miles per gallon for passenger cars, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Sales of passenger cars fell 9 percent in the same period, to 33,400, the dealers group reported.Car sales help to indicate the health of an area's economy because they represent the largest purchase that many people make in the course of the year, and are second only to home purchases for many others. They also account for more than a quarter of sales tax revenue in cities that have sizeable clusters of dealerships, such as Carlsbad, Escondido and Temecula.Dealers have blamed the downturn partly on increased caution by lenders and a deflating real estate bubble. Car sales across Southern California boomed from 2003 into 2006 as homeowners borrowed against swiftly rising home equity. A series of incentives by car manufacturers' incentives helped, too. But real estate markets reversed sharply in late 2006, and billion-dollar losses in the subprime mortgage market have made other lenders skittish.To see more of the North County Times, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.nctimes.com.

305,7Y8B-29W0-YBKJ-B1N8-00000-00.txt,"(RTTNews) - The Taiwan stock market has finished lower in three of five trading days since the end of the five-day winning streak in which it had gathered more than 250 points or 3.2 percent on its way to a 17-month closing high. The Taiwan Stock Exchange ended just below the 7,760-point plateau, and now investors are anticipating continued weakness at the opening of trade on Friday.The global forecast for the Asian markets is soft, thanks to continued selling pressure among the technology and financial stocks. Commodities are also under pressure, with oil stocks expected to ease and gold stocks may see profit taking after hitting another fresh record high. The European and U.S. markets finished sharply lower, and the Asian bourses are also expected to track to the downside.The TSE finished slightly lower on Thursday, thanks to weakness from the food, textile, cement and financial sectors - although the technology and construction shares provided strong support.For the day, the index eased 6.71 points or 0.9 percent to finish at 7,759.98 after trading between 7,797.41 and 7,751.06 on turnover of 138.01 billion Taiwan dollars. There were 1,361 decliners and 1,263 gainers, with 264 stocks finishing unchanged.The lead from Wall Street is firmly negative as stocks moved considerably lower on Thursday, with some disappointing economic data prompting traders to cash in on the recent strength in the markets. The major averages all closed in negative territory, backing further off of the one-year highs set on Tuesday.Before the start of trading, the Labor Department reported that first-time jobless claims in the week ended November 14th came in at 505,000, unchanged from the previous week&amp;apos;s revised figure. Economists had been expecting jobless claims to edge up to 504,000 from the 502,000 originally reported for the previous week. With jobless claims unchanged, they remained above the 500,000 level, pointing to continued weakness in the labor market. Jobless claims have not been below 500,000 since coming in at 488,000 in the week ended January 3rd.Separately, the Conference Board reported a continued increase in its leading economic indicators index in the month of October, although the increase by the index was slightly smaller than economists had been anticipating. The leading indicators index rose 0.3 percent in October following a 1.0 percent gain in September and a 0.4 percent increase in August. While the index rose for the seventh consecutive month, economists had been expecting a 0.4 percent increase.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia provided one of the few bright spots on the day, releasing a report showing that activity in the mid-Atlantic region&amp;apos;s manufacturing sector picked up in November by much more than economists had expected. The Philly Fed said its index of regional activity in the manufacturing sector rose to 16.7 in November from 11.5 in October, with a positive reading indicating growth in the sector. Economists had been expecting a much more modest increase by the index to 12.2.In other news, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said that the U.S. has a long way to go to ensure a full economic recovery and guarantee that last year&amp;apos;s financial collapse will not happen again in the future. Speaking before the congressional Joint Economic Committee on Capitol Hill earlier today, Geithner said that the regulatory regime that is currently in place is the same regime that failed to prevent the ***financial crisis**, filled with too many agencies and too many regulatory gaps.The major averages ended the session firmly in negative territory, although well off their worst levels of the day. The Dow fell by 93.87 points or 0.9 percent to 10,332.44, the NASDAQ dropped by 36.32 points or 1.7 percent to 2,156.82 and the S&amp;amp;P 500 closed down by 14.90 points or 1.3 percent at 1,094.90.In economic news, Taiwan will on Friday announce current account data for the third quarter of 2009. Analysts are expecting a surplus of $8.54 billion after the $9.92 billion surplus in the previous three months.For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.comCopyright(c) 2009 RTTNews.com, Inc.
