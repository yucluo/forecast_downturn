       "      <td>for people lacking health insurance in the washington region, where they live can make all the difference in getting affordable health care.the district makes it easy, with its taxpayer-funded health insurance for everyone  within generous income restrictions. but about 10 percent of eligible adults remain uninsured, and the city wants to find and enroll them.at the other end of the spectrum is prince george's county, where recent census bureau statistics show that one in five working-age adults is uninsured. many are the working poor, who have to choose between getting a checkup and buying groceries. five free clinics in the county  treated 6,000  people last year, a small fraction of the uninsured.the census statistics underscore wide regional differences in how many people are uninsured. health-care professionals say there also are gaps in health, measured by such data as how many people are tested for serious diseases and how many children are born prematurely. a report this spring by the metropolitan washington council of governments found that average life expectancy ranged from 72 in the district to 81 in montgomery county.a lack of health insurance is not the only factor determining whether people have access to care. but many clinics that provide free or low-cost health care to low-income residents say they are flooded with people who have let their health slide, often for years, because they have no insurance.\"free clinics are not adequate to address the need,\" said kelley woodward, medical director of the alexandria health department and the lead doctor for  cog's report on community health status indicators. \"there's a huge shortage of services for people without health insurance. the clinics are all overwhelmed.\"of particular concern are adults 18 to 64. children can be covered under federal and state programs, and seniors get medicare. most adults get no help. clinics report a sharp increase during the ***recession** in the working poor and unemployed patients.\"they're people who had really good jobs and who have lost really everything,\" said michelle schuler, executive director of the free clinic in prince william county, where 17 percent of working-age adults are uninsured. \"it's humbling for them to have to ask for help. they think the situation is going to change, and so they go without their medications for hypertension or diabetes. by the time they realize things aren't turning around and they come to us, they're very sick.\"some of the area's most affluent counties have relatively high numbers of uninsured residents. in montgomery, 16 percent of working-age adults lack insurance, according to the census estimates. in fairfax, it's 13 percent.prince george's has the most. donald shell, head of the health department, estimates that 150,000 of the county's 820,000 residents, including children and the elderly, are uninsured.\"prince george's is in a quagmire,\" shell said. \"many residents, though they are employed, have incomes too high to qualify for medicaid.\" so some go without insurance.residents earning more than $27,562 for a family of four do not qualify for care at one of the five clinics run in the county by greater baden medical services, a nonprofit group. \"so many people are, like, a dollar over the cutoff,\" said sarah leonard, executive director of greater baden. \"we have a lot of people struggling to get by in an area where living costs are high, and they're not able to get coverage. so they just don't get care at all.\"shell said the county is considering opening a primary-care clinic at the county hospital, where the uninsured could seek care for one-fifth the cost of going to the emergency room.costs have waylaid many a plan.only an infusion of $1.2 million in federal stimulus money kept the prince william community health center from closing its doors. the center served 6,000 people last year, director liz sykes said. many are jobless or uninsured working poor who have part-time or entry-level jobs. at the free clinic, which is open two nights a week, schuler said she has seen more homeless patients in the past seven months than in the previous 15 years.montgomery set an ambitious goal of caring for 40,000 uninsured residents -- half the estimated total -- at a network of \"safety net\" clinics. five years later, the county is halfway there and the clinics have waiting lists.county council member george leventhal (d-at large), who heads the panel's health and human services committee, said most of the uninsured are working-class people and recent immigrants. council member duchy trachtenberg (d-at large) said a growing number are divorced women 55 to 64. many forgo health insurance in the face of more pressing needs.\"the cost of living is so high,\" leventhal said. \"if you're making discretionary decisions, you pay the rent or groceries or health insurance.\"the district boasts the most comprehensive health coverage in the region -- and some of the biggest health challenges. it has the region's highest rates of low birth  weights, premature births, breast cancer, heart disease and aids, for example.julie hudman, head of the city's health care finance department, said the district has fewer uninsured adults because of its high eligibility levels. its healthcare alliance program covers almost 55,000 adults who make up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or $36,620 for a family of three. fully a third of the adults in the city are covered under alliance or medicaid.under alliance, patients have no premiums and no cost sharing. prescription drugs cost the patient $1. everyone is eligible, including newly arrived and undocumented immigrants.\"our goal is to have everyone covered,\" hudman said. a survey is being done to determine why some people haven't enrolled.woodward, who headed the cog study, said hospitals are providing a lot of primary care that the clinics cannot handle, particularly in emergency rooms.\"having a fifth of adults without health insurance is a huge problem,\" he said. \"having people in our community who don't have the health care they need while others readily have access to it is not a comfortable thing for me as a physician.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>what would it take to stop the madness of rising oil prices? shocking increases in crude-oil costs - which spiked above $135 a barrel at one point last week - are now pushing airlines and truckers to the brink, forcing many consumers to say they are staying home this holiday weekend, and recharging fears of ***recession** in the face of $4-a-gallon gasoline. it's a supply-demand problem on steroids. here are five possible solutions, along with the outlook for each. solution no. 1:  reduce world demand for oil. outlook: very unlikely. but oil supplies haven't changed much over the last five years, so why not simply throttle back demand? well, who isn't trying? hybrid cars and fluorescent bulbs help. but as the saying goes, the genie is out of the bottle. oil demand, particularly from china, continues to skyrocket. at the same time, efforts to switch to alternative fuels continue to stumble - and are short-term losers. converting corn to ethanol is making food more expensive, and scarce, some experts say. building more nuclear power stations would take years. solar and wind power? planners are just waking up to the huge amounts of real estate the current technologies would consume to reach meaningful outputs. solution no. 2: pump more  oil out of the ground. outlook: not likely for decades. the international energy agency, which is based in paris, said last week that oil companies might be incapable of keeping up with demand for the next 20 years. the opec oil cartel is disinclined to try harder, and some of its officials even question whether there is a supply shortage. on thursday, opec secretary-general abdullah al-badri pointed a finger at market speculation and the weak dollar to explain high crude prices. \"even if we increase output tomorrow, the prices will not come down, because of speculation and because of a weak dollar,\" he said. \"when we see there is a shortage of supply, we will act.\" solution no. 3: pop the speculation bubble. outlook: try changing human nature. if wild speculation is the problem, let's round up those naughty traders and bus them to chester and bensalem to bet the slots and ponies instead of the price of a barrel of crude. but then what? speculators, who never intend to take possession of a barrel of oil, are simply paying what they think that barrel will be worth at some future date. they're taking into account all the same fundamental factors that have propelled the price of oil up for the last six years. solution no. 4: strengthen the weak dollar. outlook: this could happen in coming months. the federal reserve has signaled that it doesn't see further interest-rate cuts for now, and opec president chakib khelil told reuters last week that a 10 percent gain in the dollar probably would result in a 40 percent drop in oil prices. this is largely because oil futures are traded in dollars, and a weak dollar makes oil less expensive to buyers dealing in other currencies. meanwhile, the price of oil has tended to slip on any day that the dollar strengthens against the euro. economists still disagree, though, on how best to shore up the dollar and about what effect that would have on the overall economy. instead, the fed has been trying to stave off ***recession** and solve a credit crisis by lowering key interest rates. solution no. 5:  a big, bad ***recession**. outlook: sadly, this could happen, regardless of the efforts of the fed, stimulus checks and anything else. and it is oil that could finally tip the economy into ***recession**. experts say gasoline prices have yet to catch up with the spike in crude, and $200-a-barrel oil, which some officials say is possible in the next two years, could cost $6 per gallon at the gas pump. chances are, that'll do the trick. contact staff writer reid kanaley at 215-854-5114 or rkanaley@phillynews.com.</td>\n",

       "      <td>c(\"Mortgage crisis? What ***mortgage crisis**? That may as well be the slogan for Mortech, a Lincoln-based provider of mortgage rate quote software. Despite hundreds of billions of dollars in bad mortgages that have demanded a government bailout, and a housing market that is depressed just about everywhere in the country, Mortech is not only surviving, it's thriving. Founder and owner Don Kracl said there are a couple of reasons. For one, Kracl said Mortech did very little business with subprime lenders who issue risky mortgages to people with questionable credit and who largely have been responsible for the country's mortgage troubles. \\\"The implosion of the subprime business has been a plus for us,\\\" Kracl said. \\\"The prime market is really our space.\\\" The prime market - more traditional, fixedrate mortgages - is the other big reason for Mortech's continued success.Because of all the mortgage defaults and foreclosures, lending standards have tightened significantly over the past year, leading to new sets of requirements for lenders.\\\"The business has just become much more fluid and complex even though there are fewer (mortgage) products,\\\" Kracl saidThat has led to a demand for Mortech's products, which allow lenders to plug dozens or even hundreds of variables into a computer and receive an accurate rate quote in seconds.Kracl said Mortech's annual growth rate over the past few years has been about 40 percent, a number the company is on track to hit again this year.In the past year, he said his staff has grown from 15 to 25, and the company is putting the finishing touches on a renovation and expansion of its building in the Lincoln Trade Center that will give it room to grow to about 50 people.Much of Mortech's growth has been spurred by its deal with well-known online lender LendingTree.As part of the deal, signed last October, Mortech provided LendingTree clients access to one of its software programs, called Marksman.Initially, the deal only involved LendingTree customers that were already Mortech customers, but at the time Kracl said he was optimistic about growing the number of users.Renee Harvey, Mortech's marketing director, said the company has grown its LendingTree customer base by more than 450 percent.There's a reason for that, said Allen Cravello, president of American Capital Corp. in El Segundo, Calif., a longtime Mortech customer and more recent client of LendingTree.\\\"The increase in Mortech's client base is directly related to its commitment of upholding its promises to new and old customers alike,\\\" Cravello said. \\\"Mortech isn't just talking about what they can do, they're actually doing it.\\\"Among the things the company has done recently is create a couple of new products for LendingTree and introduce a mobile version of its Marksman software.Kracl said one of the reasons Mortech has been so successful with LendingTree is the nature of Internet lending.Customers aren't going into an office during business hours to get a mortgage quote. Instead they are going online late at night or on weekends, he said.\\\"It would be too expensive for you to have personnel available to respond to offer requests at 3 in the morning,\\\" Kracl said.Sylvia Yanes, LendingTree manager at AmericaHomeKey Inc. in Dallas, said the firm was searching for a solution to do some work and allow employees to concentrate on borrowers.After becoming a Marksman customer, \\\"we've had more time to focus on our customers and have seen increases in the number of deals we're closing,\\\" she said.It's not just customers that have been happy with Mortech's products.\\\"Over the past years, Mortech has simplified the loan closing process for our network lenders who choose to use Mortech,\\\" said Loudoun Emswiler, senior director of lender technology for LendingTree. \\\"They have delivered a complete solution, all while consistently providing quality service.\\\"LendingTree has been so happy, in fact, that earlier this month it presented Mortech with an award that is given out only sparingly.At the 10th annual LendingTree Partner Summit at the company's corporate headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., Chairman and CEO Doug Lebda presented Mortech with the Rick Stiegler Innovator of the Year award, named for the company's founding chief technology officer and one of its first employees. Lebda died in 2004.\\\"The Innovator of the Year award is an important way for us to recognize a partner whose hard work and determination follow the same suit as Rick's,\\\" Lebda said. \\\"Mortech jumped at the opportunity to create a new technology that helps our lender partners improve their business efficiency and accuracy ...\\\"Kracl said the award, which LendingTree doesn't give out every year, was a complete surprise.\\\"I was speechless,\\\" he said. \\\"And everybody here will tell you that's a rarity.\\\"Reach Matt Olberding at 473-2647 or molberding@journalstar.com\", \\n\"Mortech, a Lincoln company, won a LendingTree award named for LendingTree's founding chief technology officer Rick Stiegler, who died in 2004.

       "      <td>Most Spokane County residents will receive tax assessment notifications in today's mail. Look for a postcard, not a letter, unless you own more than one piece of real estate, Assessor Ralph Baker advised. Baker said his office will save about $20,000 by substituting postcards for letters. \"We'll see how the public takes it, but it seems to be going fine,\" he said Friday. Assessed values are up about 14 percent throughout the county, compared with an increase of approximately 16 percent last year, Baker said. \"I don't know that you'd even call it a slowdown,\" he said. \"That's not much difference.\" The county's economy remains \"vibrant,\" with no slowdown in home sales and only a slight reduction in building permits, Baker said. He speculated that the amount of value added to the county's tax base will be more like the $779 million added in 2005 than last year's $1 billion, but he noted this year's final calculation hadn't been made. Property values are rising throughout the county, he added. The increases don't necessarily mean individual property tax bills will be going up. Assessed values are just one factor in tax bills. Other factors are the amount of government spending and the number of people splitting the tab. Baker urged residents who want more information about how tax bills are computed to read his Web site at  www.spokanecounty.org/assessor. The site has a wealth of information, including advice on how to improve your chances of winning an appeal if you disagree with your assessment, he said. \"It's that transparency-in-government thing,\" Baker said. \"We want to make sure you see what we're doing.\" As a new feature, the site contains almost all the sketches and other information from the now-archived field books that appraisers used in the past to record their observations. Other online information - searchable by address or parcel number - includes current appraisal and tax information for each property as well as a photograph. For those who don't receive or who lose their assessment notices, a digital copy is available online. The cards have contact information for the appraisers who handled the property in question, and the Web site adds a direct e-mail link to the appraiser. Baker said he encourages people who have questions or concerns about their appraisals to get in touch with their appraiser, or with him if the appraiser doesn't respond within five days. \"The best way is by e-mail because that way we have a written record,\" Baker said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>c(\"May 31--For the first time in the past several years, the Woodward city budget will shrink.Woodward City Commissioners participated in a budget workshop with City Financial Officer Doug Haines and City Manager Alan Riffel Tuesday night to review a proposed of $38.6 million for Fiscal Year 2009-2010.If approved during Monday's city commission meeting, this 2009-2010 budget will represent an almost 13 percent decrease from the current city budget which was approved at $44.2 million a year ago.\\\"A very frugal budget has been proposed with a limited impact on reserves,\\\" Riffel said.Beyond not impacting reserves, he said another positive is that the budget was designed in a way \\\"not to impact employees negatively.\\\"The city manager said the budget does not include any layoffs or even benefit decreases.Haines added that the budget even includes \\\"cost of living increases for police and fire\\\" as the result of a two-year agreement with the local police and fire unions.However, he said \\\"they will be getting increases where the rest of the city employees will not.\\\"Not giving any raises other than those required by the union agreements, is just one of the ways that Haines said he was able to develop the \\\"frugal\\\" budget and not dip too far into reserves.Other ways Haines achieved the budget was to scale back on various capital purchases, such as not funding various vehicle purchases other than what is absolutely necessary.Riffel explained that the city's usual policy with vehicles, such as the police units, is to replace them whenever they accumulate approximately 100,000 miles. But this year, instead of budgeting to replace a couple of units that already have around 90,000 miles, the city is asking that the departments put a few more miles on them, he said.Another way Haines has created savings in next year's budget is by \\\"push(ing) a few things back into this year's budget,\\\" which he said the city has been \\\"in the habit of doing the past few years.\\\"Haines and Riffel explained that when the ***economic crisis** began to reach a head this past fall, they shut down capital purchases throughout city departments in order to save what money they could for the coming year.This is something that the city typically does every year about nine months into the Fiscal Year, Riffel said, noting that this year it was done only five to six months in.By doing it so early, they not only created resources for next year, but there is still some revenue available to the various departments to make important purchases this year.In addition to being frugal as far as expenses, Haines noted that the FY 2009-2010 budget also takes a frugal stance with regard to income.He explained that the budget has been based on an anticipated five percent decrease in tax revenue.This could be a positive or a negative, he said, because if the economy improves and sales tax receipts begin to increase again, that would mean more money for the city to work with. However, he said if the city actually experiences a 10 percent decrease in tax revenue, the budget would have to be readjusted to be even more frugal and perhaps dip farther into reserves.Nevertheless, both Haines and Riffel remained optimistic about the budget and noted that Woodward is in a better budgetary circumstance than other cities throughout the state and even the state itself.For example, Riffel noted that Tulsa is making layoffs and handing out furloughs, while \\\"the state is facing a $600 million deduction and that's with stimulus money.\\\"However, in the next year Woodward should continue to see progress through ongoing work at Crystal Beach and beginning work on the new conference center, the city manager said.In fact, city commissioners are expected to consider service agreements related to the conference center during their regular meeting Monday evening.However, the budget will be the major item for consideration during the meeting. But before the commissioners vote on whether to approve the budget, a public hearing will be held to allow for public comment about the budget.Also on the agenda for both the public hearing and the city commission meeting is discussion about the possible demolition of a building at 1001 8th St. which was damaged by the late spring snow and which the owners have yet to do anything about despite letters from code enforcement.The public hearing will begin at 7 p.m. Monday in the Commission Room of City Hall with the city commission meeting to immediately follow.To see more of The Woodward News or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://woodwardnews.net.

       "      <td>c(\"Jul. 25--Sales of new vehicles in San Diego County and across California took a turn for the worse in the first half of 2008 with pickup trucks and SUVs taking a particularly severe beating, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.In San Diego, just 24,200 were sold in the first six months of the year, down 26 percent from the first half of 2007. Pickups and SUVs go about 18 miles on a gallon of gasoline, on average, compared to about 23 miles per gallon for passenger cars, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Sales of passenger cars fell 9 percent in the same period, to 33,400, the dealers group reported.Car sales help to indicate the health of an area's economy because they represent the largest purchase that many people make in the course of the year, and are second only to home purchases for many others. They also account for more than a quarter of sales tax revenue in cities that have sizeable clusters of dealerships, such as Carlsbad, Escondido and Temecula.Dealers have blamed the downturn partly on increased caution by lenders and a deflating real estate bubble. Car sales across Southern California boomed from 2003 into 2006 as homeowners borrowed against swiftly rising home equity. A series of incentives by car manufacturers' incentives helped, too. But real estate markets reversed sharply in late 2006, and billion-dollar losses in the subprime mortgage market have made other lenders skittish.To see more of the North County Times, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.nctimes.com.

       "      <td>(RTTNews) - The Taiwan stock market has finished lower in three of five trading days since the end of the five-day winning streak in which it had gathered more than 250 points or 3.2 percent on its way to a 17-month closing high. The Taiwan Stock Exchange ended just below the 7,760-point plateau, and now investors are anticipating continued weakness at the opening of trade on Friday.The global forecast for the Asian markets is soft, thanks to continued selling pressure among the technology and financial stocks. Commodities are also under pressure, with oil stocks expected to ease and gold stocks may see profit taking after hitting another fresh record high. The European and U.S. markets finished sharply lower, and the Asian bourses are also expected to track to the downside.The TSE finished slightly lower on Thursday, thanks to weakness from the food, textile, cement and financial sectors - although the technology and construction shares provided strong support.For the day, the index eased 6.71 points or 0.9 percent to finish at 7,759.98 after trading between 7,797.41 and 7,751.06 on turnover of 138.01 billion Taiwan dollars. There were 1,361 decliners and 1,263 gainers, with 264 stocks finishing unchanged.The lead from Wall Street is firmly negative as stocks moved considerably lower on Thursday, with some disappointing economic data prompting traders to cash in on the recent strength in the markets. The major averages all closed in negative territory, backing further off of the one-year highs set on Tuesday.Before the start of trading, the Labor Department reported that first-time jobless claims in the week ended November 14th came in at 505,000, unchanged from the previous week&amp;amp;apos;s revised figure. Economists had been expecting jobless claims to edge up to 504,000 from the 502,000 originally reported for the previous week. With jobless claims unchanged, they remained above the 500,000 level, pointing to continued weakness in the labor market. Jobless claims have not been below 500,000 since coming in at 488,000 in the week ended January 3rd.Separately, the Conference Board reported a continued increase in its leading economic indicators index in the month of October, although the increase by the index was slightly smaller than economists had been anticipating. The leading indicators index rose 0.3 percent in October following a 1.0 percent gain in September and a 0.4 percent increase in August. While the index rose for the seventh consecutive month, economists had been expecting a 0.4 percent increase.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia provided one of the few bright spots on the day, releasing a report showing that activity in the mid-Atlantic region&amp;amp;apos;s manufacturing sector picked up in November by much more than economists had expected. The Philly Fed said its index of regional activity in the manufacturing sector rose to 16.7 in November from 11.5 in October, with a positive reading indicating growth in the sector. Economists had been expecting a much more modest increase by the index to 12.2.In other news, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said that the U.S. has a long way to go to ensure a full economic recovery and guarantee that last year&amp;amp;apos;s financial collapse will not happen again in the future. Speaking before the congressional Joint Economic Committee on Capitol Hill earlier today, Geithner said that the regulatory regime that is currently in place is the same regime that failed to prevent the ***financial crisis**, filled with too many agencies and too many regulatory gaps.The major averages ended the session firmly in negative territory, although well off their worst levels of the day. The Dow fell by 93.87 points or 0.9 percent to 10,332.44, the NASDAQ dropped by 36.32 points or 1.7 percent to 2,156.82 and the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 closed down by 14.90 points or 1.3 percent at 1,094.90.In economic news, Taiwan will on Friday announce current account data for the third quarter of 2009. Analysts are expecting a surplus of $8.54 billion after the $9.92 billion surplus in the previous three months.For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.comCopyright(c) 2009 RTTNews.com, Inc.

a lot of industries are struggling with the ***recession**, monterey county farmers are holding their own.\\\"agriculture tends to be noncyclical,\\\" said steve seldomridge, a senior vice president of wells fargo bank in monterey.the gross value of monterey county agriculture products was up in 2008 by one tenth of a percent, a year after a 9.5 percent increase.\\\"we suffer more when we overproduce\\\" and prices go down, said john hillen, a vice president of rabobank in salinas. \\\"we have a lot of good, stable production here.\\\"the rising fuel prices that hit their peak last year made things tough on farmers. fuel is one-quarter to one-third of a farmer's cost, seldomridge said.even with fuel prices down substantially from a year ago, farmers are looking for ways to conserve fuel, hillen said.consumers shifted their food-buying habits during the ***recession**. that has meant more sales of fresh, unprocessed foods and fewer high-priced items.both bankers say monterey county winemakers and grape growers have seen a decline in sales for higher-priced wines.\\\"people aren't drinking less wine,\\\" seldomridge said.while farmers are holding their own, they're generally not putting money into expansion.\\\"there's a lot of caution out there,\\\" seldomridge said.hillen of rabobank said there's more land for sale now.a few years ago, seldomridge of wells fargo said, growers sometimes had trouble finding enough workers. but when the economyis down, he said, there's not a shortage of workers.to see more of the monterey county herald, or to

trust to assume all of valley capital's deposits.valley capital, a business bank, opened in 2007 near stapley drive and baseline road in mesa. as of sept. 30, it had about $40.3 million in total assets and about $41.3 million in deposits.valley capital was struggling because of significant losses in its acquisition, development and construction portfolio, said greg hernandez, fdic spokesman.\\\"you couple that with a weak real estate market and the bank failed,\\\" he said. \\\"the bank was put on the fdic's problem institution list in january and became insolvent as of sept. 30.\\\"enterprise bank &amp;

       "2    for people lacking health insurance in the washington region, where they live can make all the difference in getting affordable health care.the district makes it easy, with its taxpayer-funded health insurance for everyone  within generous income restrictions. but about 10 percent of eligible adults remain uninsured, and the city wants to find and enroll them.at the other end of the spectrum is prince george's county, where recent census bureau statistics show that one in five working-age adults is uninsured. many are the working poor, who have to choose between getting a checkup and buying groceries. five free clinics in the county  treated 6,000  people last year, a small fraction of the uninsured.the census statistics underscore wide regional differences in how many people are uninsured. health-care professionals say there also are gaps in health, measured by such data as how many people are tested for serious diseases and how many children are born prematurely. a report this spring by the metropolitan washington council of governments found that average life expectancy ranged from 72 in the district to 81 in montgomery county.a lack of health insurance is not the only factor determining whether people have access to care. but many clinics that provide free or low-cost health care to low-income residents say they are flooded with people who have let their health slide, often for years, because they have no insurance.\"free clinics are not adequate to address the need,\" said kelley woodward, medical director of the alexandria health department and the lead doctor for  cog's report on community health status indicators. \"there's a huge shortage of services for people without health insurance. the clinics are all overwhelmed.\"of particular concern are adults 18 to 64. children can be covered under federal and state programs, and seniors get medicare. most adults get no help. clinics report a sharp increase during the ***recession** in the working poor and unemployed patients.\"they're people who had really good jobs and who have lost really everything,\" said michelle schuler, executive director of the free clinic in prince william county, where 17 percent of working-age adults are uninsured. \"it's humbling for them to have to ask for help. they think the situation is going to change, and so they go without their medications for hypertension or diabetes. by the time they realize things aren't turning around and they come to us, they're very sick.\"some of the area's most affluent counties have relatively high numbers of uninsured residents. in montgomery, 16 percent of working-age adults lack insurance, according to the census estimates. in fairfax, it's 13 percent.prince george's has the most. donald shell, head of the health department, estimates that 150,000 of the county's 820,000 residents, including children and the elderly, are uninsured.\"prince george's is in a quagmire,\" shell said. \"many residents, though they are employed, have incomes too high to qualify for medicaid.\" so some go without insurance.residents earning more than $27,562 for a family of four do not qualify for care at one of the five clinics run in the county by greater baden medical services, a nonprofit group. \"so many people are, like, a dollar over the cutoff,\" said sarah leonard, executive director of greater baden. \"we have a lot of people struggling to get by in an area where living costs are high, and they're not able to get coverage. so they just don't get care at all.\"shell said the county is considering opening a primary-care clinic at the county hospital, where the uninsured could seek care for one-fifth the cost of going to the emergency room.costs have waylaid many a plan.only an infusion of $1.2 million in federal stimulus money kept the prince william community health center from closing its doors. the center served 6,000 people last year, director liz sykes said. many are jobless or uninsured working poor who have part-time or entry-level jobs. at the free clinic, which is open two nights a week, schuler said she has seen more homeless patients in the past seven months than in the previous 15 years.montgomery set an ambitious goal of caring for 40,000 uninsured residents -- half the estimated total -- at a network of \"safety net\" clinics. five years later, the county is halfway there and the clinics have waiting lists.county council member george leventhal (d-at large), who heads the panel's health and human services committee, said most of the uninsured are working-class people and recent immigrants. council member duchy trachtenberg (d-at large) said a growing number are divorced women 55 to 64. many forgo health insurance in the face of more pressing needs.\"the cost of living is so high,\" leventhal said. \"if you're making discretionary decisions, you pay the rent or groceries or health insurance.\"the district boasts the most comprehensive health coverage in the region -- and some of the biggest health challenges. it has the region's highest rates of low birth  weights, premature births, breast cancer, heart disease and aids, for example.julie hudman, head of the city's health care finance department, said the district has fewer uninsured adults because of its high eligibility levels. its healthcare alliance program covers almost 55,000 adults who make up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or $36,620 for a family of three. fully a third of the adults in the city are covered under alliance or medicaid.under alliance, patients have no premiums and no cost sharing. prescription drugs cost the patient $1. everyone is eligible, including newly arrived and undocumented immigrants.\"our goal is to have everyone covered,\" hudman said. a survey is being done to determine why some people haven't enrolled.woodward, who headed the cog study, said hospitals are providing a lot of primary care that the clinics cannot handle, particularly in emergency rooms.\"having a fifth of adults without health insurance is a huge problem,\" he said. \"having people in our community who don't have the health care they need while others readily have access to it is not a comfortable thing for me as a physician.\"   \n",

shocking increases in crude-oil costs - which spiked above $135 a barrel at one point last week - are now pushing airlines and truckers to the brink, forcing many consumers to say they are staying home this holiday weekend, and recharging fears of ***recession** in the face of $4-a-gallon gasoline. it's a supply-demand problem on steroids. here are five possible solutions, along with the outlook for each. solution no. 1:  reduce world demand for oil. outlook: very unlikely. but oil supplies haven't changed much over the last five years, so why not simply throttle back demand? well, who isn't trying? hybrid cars and fluorescent bulbs help. but as the saying goes, the genie is out of the bottle. oil demand, particularly from china, continues to skyrocket. at the same time, efforts to switch to alternative fuels continue to stumble - and are short-term losers. converting corn to ethanol is making food more expensive, and scarce, some experts say. building more nuclear power stations would take years. solar and wind power? planners are just waking up to the huge amounts of real estate the current technologies would consume to reach meaningful outputs. solution no. 2: pump more  oil out of the ground. outlook: not likely for decades. the international energy agency, which is based in paris, said last week that oil companies might be incapable of keeping up with demand for the next 20 years. the opec oil cartel is disinclined to try harder, and some of its officials even question whether there is a supply shortage. on thursday, opec secretary-general abdullah al-badri pointed a finger at market speculation and the weak dollar to explain high crude prices. \"even if we increase output tomorrow, the prices will not come down, because of speculation and because of a weak dollar,\" he said. \"when we see there is a shortage of supply, we will act.\" solution no. 3: pop the speculation bubble. outlook: try changing human nature. if wild speculation is the problem, let's round up those naughty traders and bus them to chester and bensalem to bet the slots and ponies instead of the price of a barrel of crude. but then what? speculators, who never intend to take possession of a barrel of oil, are simply paying what they think that barrel will be worth at some future date. they're taking into account all the same fundamental factors that have propelled the price of oil up for the last six years. solution no. 4: strengthen the weak dollar. outlook: this could happen in coming months. the federal reserve has signaled that it doesn't see further interest-rate cuts for now, and opec president chakib khelil told reuters last week that a 10 percent gain in the dollar probably would result in a 40 percent drop in oil prices. this is largely because oil futures are traded in dollars, and a weak dollar makes oil less expensive to buyers dealing in other currencies. meanwhile, the price of oil has tended to slip on any day that the dollar strengthens against the euro. economists still disagree, though, on how best to shore up the dollar and about what effect that would have on the overall economy. instead, the fed has been trying to stave off ***recession** and solve a credit crisis by lowering key interest rates. solution no. 5:  a big, bad ***recession**. outlook: sadly, this could happen, regardless of the efforts of the fed, stimulus checks and anything else. and it is oil that could finally tip the economy into ***recession**. experts say gasoline prices have yet to catch up with the spike in crude, and $200-a-barrel oil, which some officials say is possible in the next two years, could cost $6 per gallon at the gas pump. chances are, that'll do the trick. contact staff writer reid kanaley at 215-854-5114 or rkanaley@phillynews.com.    \n",

What ***mortgage crisis**? That may as well be the slogan for Mortech, a Lincoln-based provider of mortgage rate quote software. Despite hundreds of billions of dollars in bad mortgages that have demanded a government bailout, and a housing market that is depressed just about everywhere in the country, Mortech is not only surviving, it's thriving. Founder and owner Don Kracl said there are a couple of reasons. For one, Kracl said Mortech did very little business with subprime lenders who issue risky mortgages to people with questionable credit and who largely have been responsible for the country's mortgage troubles. \\\"The implosion of the subprime business has been a plus for us,\\\" Kracl said. \\\"The prime market is really our space.\\\" The prime market - more traditional, fixedrate mortgages - is the other big reason for Mortech's continued success.Because of all the mortgage defaults and foreclosures, lending standards have tightened significantly over the past year, leading to new sets of requirements for lenders.\\\"The business has just become much more fluid and complex even though there are fewer (mortgage) products,\\\" Kracl saidThat has led to a demand for Mortech's products, which allow lenders to plug dozens or even hundreds of variables into a computer and receive an accurate rate quote in seconds.Kracl said Mortech's annual growth rate over the past few years has been about 40 percent, a number the company is on track to hit again this year.In the past year, he said his staff has grown from 15 to 25, and the company is putting the finishing touches on a renovation and expansion of its building in the Lincoln Trade Center that will give it room to grow to about 50 people.Much of Mortech's growth has been spurred by its deal with well-known online lender LendingTree.As part of the deal, signed last October, Mortech provided LendingTree clients access to one of its software programs, called Marksman.Initially, the deal only involved LendingTree customers that were already Mortech customers, but at the time Kracl said he was optimistic about growing the number of users.Renee Harvey, Mortech's marketing director, said the company has grown its LendingTree customer base by more than 450 percent.There's a reason for that, said Allen Cravello, president of American Capital Corp. in El Segundo, Calif., a longtime Mortech customer and more recent client of LendingTree.\\\"The increase in Mortech's client base is directly related to its commitment of upholding its promises to new and old customers alike,\\\" Cravello said. \\\"Mortech isn't just talking about what they can do, they're actually doing it.\\\"Among the things the company has done recently is create a couple of new products for LendingTree and introduce a mobile version of its Marksman software.Kracl said one of the reasons Mortech has been so successful with LendingTree is the nature of Internet lending.Customers aren't going into an office during business hours to get a mortgage quote. Instead they are going online late at night or on weekends, he said.\\\"It would be too expensive for you to have personnel available to respond to offer requests at 3 in the morning,\\\" Kracl said.Sylvia Yanes, LendingTree manager at AmericaHomeKey Inc. in Dallas, said the firm was searching for a solution to do some work and allow employees to concentrate on borrowers.After becoming a Marksman customer, \\\"we've had more time to focus on our customers and have seen increases in the number of deals we're closing,\\\" she said.It's not just customers that have been happy with Mortech's products.\\\"Over the past years, Mortech has simplified the loan closing process for our network lenders who choose to use Mortech,\\\" said Loudoun Emswiler, senior director of lender technology for LendingTree. \\\"They have delivered a complete solution, all while consistently providing quality service.\\\"LendingTree has been so happy, in fact, that earlier this month it presented Mortech with an award that is given out only sparingly.At the 10th annual LendingTree Partner Summit at the company's corporate headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., Chairman and CEO Doug Lebda presented Mortech with the Rick Stiegler Innovator of the Year award, named for the company's founding chief technology officer and one of its first employees.

Look for a postcard, not a letter, unless you own more than one piece of real estate, Assessor Ralph Baker advised. Baker said his office will save about $20,000 by substituting postcards for letters. \"We'll see how the public takes it, but it seems to be going fine,\" he said Friday. Assessed values are up about 14 percent throughout the county, compared with an increase of approximately 16 percent last year, Baker said. \"I don't know that you'd even call it a slowdown,\" he said. \"That's not much difference.\" The county's economy remains \"vibrant,\" with no slowdown in home sales and only a slight reduction in building permits, Baker said. He speculated that the amount of value added to the county's tax base will be more like the $779 million added in 2005 than last year's $1 billion, but he noted this year's final calculation hadn't been made. Property values are rising throughout the county, he added. The increases don't necessarily mean individual property tax bills will be going up. Assessed values are just one factor in tax bills. Other factors are the amount of government spending and the number of people splitting the tab. Baker urged residents who want more information about how tax bills are computed to read his Web site at  www.spokanecounty.org/assessor. The site has a wealth of information, including advice on how to improve your chances of winning an appeal if you disagree with your assessment, he said. \"It's that transparency-in-government thing,\" Baker said. \"We want to make sure you see what we're doing.\" As a new feature, the site contains almost all the sketches and other information from the now-archived field books that appraisers used in the past to record their observations. Other online information - searchable by address or parcel number - includes current appraisal and tax information for each property as well as a photograph. For those who don't receive or who lose their assessment notices, a digital copy is available online. The cards have contact information for the appraisers who handled the property in question, and the Web site adds a direct e-mail link to the appraiser. Baker said he encourages people who have questions or concerns about their appraisals to get in touch with their appraiser, or with him if the appraiser doesn't respond within five days. \"The best way is by e-mail because that way we have a written record,\" Baker said.   \n",

But this year, instead of budgeting to replace a couple of units that already have around 90,000 miles, the city is asking that the departments put a few more miles on them, he said.Another way Haines has created savings in next year's budget is by \\\"push(ing) a few things back into this year's budget,\\\" which he said the city has been \\\"in the habit of doing the past few years.\\\"Haines and Riffel explained that when the ***economic crisis** began to reach a head this past fall, they shut down capital purchases throughout city departments in order to save what money they could for the coming year.This is something that the city typically does every year about nine months into the Fiscal Year, Riffel said, noting that this year it was done only five to six months in.By doing it so early, they not only created resources for next year, but there is still some revenue available to the various departments to make important purchases this year.In addition to being frugal as far as expenses, Haines noted that the FY 2009-2010 budget also takes a frugal stance with regard to income.He explained that the budget has been based on an anticipated five percent decrease in tax revenue.This could be a positive or a negative, he said, because if the economy improves and sales tax receipts begin to increase again, that would mean more money for the city to work with. However, he said if the city actually experiences a 10 percent decrease in tax revenue, the budget would have to be readjusted to be even more frugal and perhaps dip farther into reserves.Nevertheless, both Haines and Riffel remained optimistic about the budget and noted that Woodward is in a better budgetary circumstance than other cities throughout the state and even the state itself.For example, Riffel noted that Tulsa is making layoffs and handing out furloughs, while \\\"the state is facing a $600 million deduction and that's with stimulus money.\\\"However, in the next year Woodward should continue to see progress through ongoing work at Crystal Beach and beginning work on the new conference center, the city manager said.In fact, city commissioners are expected to consider service agreements related to the conference center during their regular meeting Monday evening.However, the budget will be the major item for consideration during the meeting. But before the commissioners vote on whether to approve the budget, a public hearing will be held to allow for public comment about the budget.Also on the agenda for both the public hearing and the city commission meeting is discussion about the possible demolition of a building at 1001 8th St. which was damaged by the late spring snow and which the owners have yet to do anything about despite letters from code enforcement.The public hearing will begin at 7 p.m. Monday in the Commission Room of City Hall with the city commission meeting to immediately follow.To see more of The Woodward News or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://woodwardnews.net.

Pickups and SUVs go about 18 miles on a gallon of gasoline, on average, compared to about 23 miles per gallon for passenger cars, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Sales of passenger cars fell 9 percent in the same period, to 33,400, the dealers group reported.Car sales help to indicate the health of an area's economy because they represent the largest purchase that many people make in the course of the year, and are second only to home purchases for many others. They also account for more than a quarter of sales tax revenue in cities that have sizeable clusters of dealerships, such as Carlsbad, Escondido and Temecula.Dealers have blamed the downturn partly on increased caution by lenders and a deflating real estate bubble. Car sales across Southern California boomed from 2003 into 2006 as homeowners borrowed against swiftly rising home equity. A series of incentives by car manufacturers' incentives helped, too. But real estate markets reversed sharply in late 2006, and billion-dollar losses in the subprime mortgage market have made other lenders skittish.To see more of the North County Times, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.nctimes.com.

The Taiwan Stock Exchange ended just below the 7,760-point plateau, and now investors are anticipating continued weakness at the opening of trade on Friday.The global forecast for the Asian markets is soft, thanks to continued selling pressure among the technology and financial stocks. Commodities are also under pressure, with oil stocks expected to ease and gold stocks may see profit taking after hitting another fresh record high. The European and U.S. markets finished sharply lower, and the Asian bourses are also expected to track to the downside.The TSE finished slightly lower on Thursday, thanks to weakness from the food, textile, cement and financial sectors - although the technology and construction shares provided strong support.For the day, the index eased 6.71 points or 0.9 percent to finish at 7,759.98 after trading between 7,797.41 and 7,751.06 on turnover of 138.01 billion Taiwan dollars. There were 1,361 decliners and 1,263 gainers, with 264 stocks finishing unchanged.The lead from Wall Street is firmly negative as stocks moved considerably lower on Thursday, with some disappointing economic data prompting traders to cash in on the recent strength in the markets. The major averages all closed in negative territory, backing further off of the one-year highs set on Tuesday.Before the start of trading, the Labor Department reported that first-time jobless claims in the week ended November 14th came in at 505,000, unchanged from the previous week&amp;apos;s revised figure. Economists had been expecting jobless claims to edge up to 504,000 from the 502,000 originally reported for the previous week. With jobless claims unchanged, they remained above the 500,000 level, pointing to continued weakness in the labor market. Jobless claims have not been below 500,000 since coming in at 488,000 in the week ended January 3rd.Separately, the Conference Board reported a continued increase in its leading economic indicators index in the month of October, although the increase by the index was slightly smaller than economists had been anticipating. The leading indicators index rose 0.3 percent in October following a 1.0 percent gain in September and a 0.4 percent increase in August. While the index rose for the seventh consecutive month, economists had been expecting a 0.4 percent increase.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia provided one of the few bright spots on the day, releasing a report showing that activity in the mid-Atlantic region&amp;apos;s manufacturing sector picked up in November by much more than economists had expected. The Philly Fed said its index of regional activity in the manufacturing sector rose to 16.7 in November from 11.5 in October, with a positive reading indicating growth in the sector. Economists had been expecting a much more modest increase by the index to 12.2.In other news, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said that the U.S. has a long way to go to ensure a full economic recovery and guarantee that last year&amp;apos;s financial collapse will not happen again in the future. Speaking before the congressional Joint Economic Committee on Capitol Hill earlier today, Geithner said that the regulatory regime that is currently in place is the same regime that failed to prevent the ***financial crisis**, filled with too many agencies and too many regulatory gaps.The major averages ended the session firmly in negative territory, although well off their worst levels of the day. The Dow fell by 93.87 points or 0.9 percent to 10,332.44, the NASDAQ dropped by 36.32 points or 1.7 percent to 2,156.82 and the S&amp;amp;P 500 closed down by 14.90 points or 1.3 percent at 1,094.90.In economic news, Taiwan will on Friday announce current account data for the third quarter of 2009. Analysts are expecting a surplus of $8.54 billion after the $9.92 billion surplus in the previous three months.For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.comCopyright(c) 2009 RTTNews.com, Inc.

      "202    special section  week of the nurse  even though the economy is causing a temporary slowdown in hiring nurses susan motley sees nursing as far more recessionproof than many professions  the recession has caused a temporary blip on the radar acknowledged motley ceo of the virginia nurses association  we have heard anecdotally that some recent graduates are having a little harder time finding jobs and that some hospitals have instituted hiring freezes or even in a few instances layoffs need still growing  the need for quality health care however continues to grow as the baby boomer generation ages and needs more healthrelated services nurses play a crucial role in patient health care  the united states is currently fortunate to have the most experienced nursing work force in place in its history observed motley nurses are the gatekeepers to the healthcare system and will play a key role in any federal healthcare reform efforts  since last year the number of nurses retiring from the field dropped slightly temporarily lessening the nursing shortage that has plagued the healthcare industry for the last few years  many are staying in the work force longer said shirley gibson president of the virginia nurses association and interim vice president of nursing at vcu health system also people that were not working are coming back into the work force because their spouses have lost jobs we do feel that this is a shortterm phenomenon  when the economy begins to turn upward there will be a demand for qualified nurses the vna predicts that by  the work force will be short  nurses in virginia that means that one in three citizens of the commonwealth will not have a nurse when they need one training  to  years  we have to keep people in the pipeline by graduating nurses gibson said it takes two to four years for a nurse to get out of school  one of the issues that contribute to the nursing shortage relates to education nursing class sizes are limited because of a lack of faculty motley and gibson are hoping that situation will change  virginia has made progress in increasing education capacity at our nursing schools motley said during the last five years the number of graduates has increased by  total or  percent according to the virginia board of nursing that increase can be attributed to the work of nursing schools and educators as well as the efforts of many groups including the virginia hospital amp health care association and the virginia partnership for nursing  there is no shortage of people who want to become nurses motley said even in light of the substantial increase in nursing school capacity which is something to celebrate virginias nursing schools are still turning away hundreds of qualified applicants a year now tracking nurse data  until now it has been difficult to track the instate workforce impact related to the increase in nursing graduates  we dont know if those nurses have remained in the state gibson said that is why we are fortunate to now have the health care workforce data center the last general assembly passed legislation to allow the commonwealths department of health professions to collect data from the licensed health professions the data will be collected by the health care workforce data center which was created from a workforce investment grant and formed within the last year  this is huge gibson said they will help analyze data from schools the board of nursing and other entities to help us make information out of data it will help us in understanding the nursing shortage and what we need to work on as well as how to make policy decisions joint initiative  also this year virginia was selected to be one of  state teams to participate in the robert wood johnsonaarp center to champion nursing in america because of the states strength in advocating for good healthcare policy the center is a joint initiative working to ensure that americans have the highly skilled nurses needed to provide affordable quality health care now and in the future  the center works to increase the nations capacity to educate and retain nurses explained motley it provides technical assistance and best practices models in a variety of areas to assist states in this arena the vna also works in a support capacity with the magnet consortium whose mission it is to help create an environment of nursing excellence magnet is a designation by the american nurse credentialing center facilities have to meet certain criteria to become magnet virginia has  magnet facilities  we are one of the top  states in the united states for the number of magnet facilities gibson said efforts to retain nurses  another initiative to retain nurses in the work force in virginia is the nurse leadership institute of central virginia the institute provides leadership education for nurse managers with the goal of retaining bedside nurses and improving the quality of care of nursing  its an opportunity to share solutions and values and visions from across the state explained joanne henry the institutes director  the institute had  graduates last year and  this year one graduate reported to henry that two units at her facility that had  percent turnover rates two years ago now have a less than  percent turnover rate  one has a  percent turnover rate which is phenomenal henry said we will have better data as we go forward we will get to see if the improvements are sustained  both gibson and motley are enthusiastic about the progress made in nursing in the last year  i feel that we made substantial gains in terms of establishing a workforce state center motley said i feel good about the fact that we were able to increase nursing education capacity significantly the challenge moving forward will be sustaining that \\n\n",

      "1523       chairman ben s bernanke and federal reserve policy makers who declared that inflation was their paramount challenge just two weeks ago have been forced to make financialmarket stability the trigger for changes in interest ratesby lowering the discount rate and issuing a statement conceding threats to the economy federal open market committee members effectively ripped up the economicoutlook statement from their aug  meeting some economists describe the aboutface coming after months of assurances that the subprimemortgage rout was contained as bernankes first serious error since taking office last yearit was a rookie mistake said kenneth thomas a lecturer in finance at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school in philadelphia the fed underestimated liquidity needs of investors and the fallout from the housing recession he said adding this demonstrates the difference between booksmart and streetsmartwere getting a nice further look at the new bernanke fed said ethan harris chief us economist at lehman brothers holdings incin new york he definitely wants to use the committee and these more formal directives as opposed to former fed chief greenspans preference for speeches laden with code wordsa former chairman of the economics department at princeton university bernanke has elevated the role of forecasts in fed policy rather than amassing clues from dozens of market indicators as predecessor alan greenspan didthe fed forecasts showed that moderate growth would continue and that inflation remained the biggest danger the credit collapse has undermined that stance and bernanke may cut the benchmark interest rate by at least a quarterpoint at or before the sept  fomc meeting analysts saysometimes the dynamics change very very quickly said former fed governor laurence meyer who voted for the three reductions in  after currencies in asia russia and latin america tumbled bernankes shift tells us how difficult it is to translate financial turbulence into the macroeconomic forecastthe fed on aug  lowered its discount rate  what it charges banks for direct loans  by  percentage point to  percent in an effort to increase liquidity in longerterm loans and bondsthe initial request for the move came from fed district banks in new york and san francisco they are led respectively by timothy geithner and janet yellen both former clinton administration officials who dealt with the  currency crises the feds board of governors in washington is dominated by academicsmeyer vice chairman of macroeconomic advisors llc in washington recommended prior to the aug  fomc meeting that policy makers cease describing inflation as the biggest risk by saying the risks to growth and inflation were roughly equal the central bank would have given itself room to maneuver if markets  already weakening  continued to slidethe committee said in its statement three days ago that the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably because of the tumult in markets officials abandoned the prediction of a moderate expansion and inflation wasnt mentionedwhile leaving the main rate at  percent the panel said it is prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economythe fed has an easing bias but it is not an easing bias dictated strictly by economic conditions said stephen stanley chief economist at rbs greenwich capital markets in greenwich connecticut this is a financialmarket issue which is then bleeding into the economylast weeks policy shift notwithstanding bernankes moves to resolve the credit crunch so far have been restrained even then and unlike the greenspan era it was the fed doing the talking not any one individualthe fed pumped  billion into the banking system on aug  to free up financing in shortterm credit markets and issued a sixline statement the injection was the feds biggest since the meltdown began by contrast the european central bank added  billion in temporary reserves a day earlier ecb president jeanclaude trichet followed up with media interviews designed to reassure investorslast weeks reduction in the discount rate which is used less than the federal funds rate as a policymaking tool wasnt directed at the broad economy so much as at trying to ease gridlock in credit markets the fed said it would accept everything from homeequity loans to municipal bonds as collateral for discountwindow loans up to  daysthe decision to keep the benchmark overnight lending rate unchanged  for now  may be a sign that the central bank is still wary of bailing out bad bets by financial institutions and investors st louis fed president william poole said in an interview on aug  that only a calamity would justify a rate cut between scheduled fomc meetingsthey knew what they were doing by maintaining the antiinflation bias at their aug  meeting said former dallas fed president robert mcteer i do not agree with it but i think they were trying very hard not to have a bernanke put they were hardpressed to keep that out of it it became unrealisticformer fed officials say its difficult for central bankers to judge when they should abandon their economic outlook often arrived at through months of internal debate and calculationbernanke  is an expert in inflationtargeting and has spent much of his career in academia he is familiar with the history of the fed the policy errors and contributed to great depression research with a  paper he coauthoredbernanke earned the moniker helicopter ben after a  speech in which he indicated that if interest rates fell to zero in a weak economy he would drop money from helicopters into the banking system to keep it going this was in reference to the price phenomenon plaguing japan at the time which sparked concerns that slowing inflation in the us could lead to the same situationit is a team that is new to the challenge but it is a pretty smart group said harristhus bernanke and his colleagues have tiptoed in and are trying to strike the right balance between doing nothing and riding to the rescue said gary schlossberg senior economist at wells fargo capital management in san francisco which oversees  billion in assets theyve left the door open to a fullblown easing of monetary policy the results are mixed so far and early returns suggest were not out of the woods yet\n",
