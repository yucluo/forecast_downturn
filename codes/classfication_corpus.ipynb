       "      <td>for people lacking health insurance in the washington region, where they live can make all the difference in getting affordable health care.the district makes it easy, with its taxpayer-funded health insurance for everyone  within generous income restrictions. but about 10 percent of eligible adults remain uninsured, and the city wants to find and enroll them.at the other end of the spectrum is prince george's county, where recent census bureau statistics show that one in five working-age adults is uninsured. many are the working poor, who have to choose between getting a checkup and buying groceries. five free clinics in the county  treated 6,000  people last year, a small fraction of the uninsured.the census statistics underscore wide regional differences in how many people are uninsured. health-care professionals say there also are gaps in health, measured by such data as how many people are tested for serious diseases and how many children are born prematurely. a report this spring by the metropolitan washington council of governments found that average life expectancy ranged from 72 in the district to 81 in montgomery county.a lack of health insurance is not the only factor determining whether people have access to care. but many clinics that provide free or low-cost health care to low-income residents say they are flooded with people who have let their health slide, often for years, because they have no insurance.\"free clinics are not adequate to address the need,\" said kelley woodward, medical director of the alexandria health department and the lead doctor for  cog's report on community health status indicators. \"there's a huge shortage of services for people without health insurance. the clinics are all overwhelmed.\"of particular concern are adults 18 to 64. children can be covered under federal and state programs, and seniors get medicare. most adults get no help. clinics report a sharp increase during the ***recession** in the working poor and unemployed patients.\"they're people who had really good jobs and who have lost really everything,\" said michelle schuler, executive director of the free clinic in prince william county, where 17 percent of working-age adults are uninsured. \"it's humbling for them to have to ask for help. they think the situation is going to change, and so they go without their medications for hypertension or diabetes. by the time they realize things aren't turning around and they come to us, they're very sick.\"some of the area's most affluent counties have relatively high numbers of uninsured residents. in montgomery, 16 percent of working-age adults lack insurance, according to the census estimates. in fairfax, it's 13 percent.prince george's has the most. donald shell, head of the health department, estimates that 150,000 of the county's 820,000 residents, including children and the elderly, are uninsured.\"prince george's is in a quagmire,\" shell said. \"many residents, though they are employed, have incomes too high to qualify for medicaid.\" so some go without insurance.residents earning more than $27,562 for a family of four do not qualify for care at one of the five clinics run in the county by greater baden medical services, a nonprofit group. \"so many people are, like, a dollar over the cutoff,\" said sarah leonard, executive director of greater baden. \"we have a lot of people struggling to get by in an area where living costs are high, and they're not able to get coverage. so they just don't get care at all.\"shell said the county is considering opening a primary-care clinic at the county hospital, where the uninsured could seek care for one-fifth the cost of going to the emergency room.costs have waylaid many a plan.only an infusion of $1.2 million in federal stimulus money kept the prince william community health center from closing its doors. the center served 6,000 people last year, director liz sykes said. many are jobless or uninsured working poor who have part-time or entry-level jobs. at the free clinic, which is open two nights a week, schuler said she has seen more homeless patients in the past seven months than in the previous 15 years.montgomery set an ambitious goal of caring for 40,000 uninsured residents -- half the estimated total -- at a network of \"safety net\" clinics. five years later, the county is halfway there and the clinics have waiting lists.county council member george leventhal (d-at large), who heads the panel's health and human services committee, said most of the uninsured are working-class people and recent immigrants. council member duchy trachtenberg (d-at large) said a growing number are divorced women 55 to 64. many forgo health insurance in the face of more pressing needs.\"the cost of living is so high,\" leventhal said. \"if you're making discretionary decisions, you pay the rent or groceries or health insurance.\"the district boasts the most comprehensive health coverage in the region -- and some of the biggest health challenges. it has the region's highest rates of low birth  weights, premature births, breast cancer, heart disease and aids, for example.julie hudman, head of the city's health care finance department, said the district has fewer uninsured adults because of its high eligibility levels. its healthcare alliance program covers almost 55,000 adults who make up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or $36,620 for a family of three. fully a third of the adults in the city are covered under alliance or medicaid.under alliance, patients have no premiums and no cost sharing. prescription drugs cost the patient $1. everyone is eligible, including newly arrived and undocumented immigrants.\"our goal is to have everyone covered,\" hudman said. a survey is being done to determine why some people haven't enrolled.woodward, who headed the cog study, said hospitals are providing a lot of primary care that the clinics cannot handle, particularly in emergency rooms.\"having a fifth of adults without health insurance is a huge problem,\" he said. \"having people in our community who don't have the health care they need while others readily have access to it is not a comfortable thing for me as a physician.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>what would it take to stop the madness of rising oil prices? shocking increases in crude-oil costs - which spiked above $135 a barrel at one point last week - are now pushing airlines and truckers to the brink, forcing many consumers to say they are staying home this holiday weekend, and recharging fears of ***recession** in the face of $4-a-gallon gasoline. it's a supply-demand problem on steroids. here are five possible solutions, along with the outlook for each. solution no. 1:  reduce world demand for oil. outlook: very unlikely. but oil supplies haven't changed much over the last five years, so why not simply throttle back demand? well, who isn't trying? hybrid cars and fluorescent bulbs help. but as the saying goes, the genie is out of the bottle. oil demand, particularly from china, continues to skyrocket. at the same time, efforts to switch to alternative fuels continue to stumble - and are short-term losers. converting corn to ethanol is making food more expensive, and scarce, some experts say. building more nuclear power stations would take years. solar and wind power? planners are just waking up to the huge amounts of real estate the current technologies would consume to reach meaningful outputs. solution no. 2: pump more  oil out of the ground. outlook: not likely for decades. the international energy agency, which is based in paris, said last week that oil companies might be incapable of keeping up with demand for the next 20 years. the opec oil cartel is disinclined to try harder, and some of its officials even question whether there is a supply shortage. on thursday, opec secretary-general abdullah al-badri pointed a finger at market speculation and the weak dollar to explain high crude prices. \"even if we increase output tomorrow, the prices will not come down, because of speculation and because of a weak dollar,\" he said. \"when we see there is a shortage of supply, we will act.\" solution no. 3: pop the speculation bubble. outlook: try changing human nature. if wild speculation is the problem, let's round up those naughty traders and bus them to chester and bensalem to bet the slots and ponies instead of the price of a barrel of crude. but then what? speculators, who never intend to take possession of a barrel of oil, are simply paying what they think that barrel will be worth at some future date. they're taking into account all the same fundamental factors that have propelled the price of oil up for the last six years. solution no. 4: strengthen the weak dollar. outlook: this could happen in coming months. the federal reserve has signaled that it doesn't see further interest-rate cuts for now, and opec president chakib khelil told reuters last week that a 10 percent gain in the dollar probably would result in a 40 percent drop in oil prices. this is largely because oil futures are traded in dollars, and a weak dollar makes oil less expensive to buyers dealing in other currencies. meanwhile, the price of oil has tended to slip on any day that the dollar strengthens against the euro. economists still disagree, though, on how best to shore up the dollar and about what effect that would have on the overall economy. instead, the fed has been trying to stave off ***recession** and solve a credit crisis by lowering key interest rates. solution no. 5:  a big, bad ***recession**. outlook: sadly, this could happen, regardless of the efforts of the fed, stimulus checks and anything else. and it is oil that could finally tip the economy into ***recession**. experts say gasoline prices have yet to catch up with the spike in crude, and $200-a-barrel oil, which some officials say is possible in the next two years, could cost $6 per gallon at the gas pump. chances are, that'll do the trick. contact staff writer reid kanaley at 215-854-5114 or rkanaley@phillynews.com.</td>\n",

       "      <td>c(\"Aug. 10--At Sorbenots Coffee of Baker City, the distinct taste of every cup of espresso coffee, latte, cappuccino and other drinks was perfected by members of the Stone family before they started branching out to other communities.\\\"We started out in 1995 with a trailer in the parking lot at Lube Depot,\\\" said Phil Stone, a co-owner of Sorbenots Coffee.The company, based in Baker City, is owned by Phil and his wife, Andrea, and Phil's brother, Jason Stone.Their initial drive-through espresso business was called Cappuccino Cowboy, but they changed it to Sorbenots -- Stone Bros. written backward -- after discovering during a trademark search that the Cappuccino Cowboy had been taken.During the company's 14 years of operation, Sorbenots has grown into a chain of five coffee shops in five towns across Eastern Oregon.\\\"Duplication -- making sure every single drink is made the same in all five locations -- is critical to the success of a chain business,\\\" Phil Stone said.\\\"It's important for every customer to be confident when they order a latte or a cappuccino that it's going to taste the same from one Sorbenots to the next, whether they're in Ontario, Baker City, La Grande, Pendleton or Hermiston,\\\" he said.Before getting into the coffee business, the Stone brothers earned their living as wildland firefighters. To make ends meet during the winter months and slow fire seasons they started a sandwich shop in 1995 called Little Joe's Cafe and later opened Cappuccino Cowboy, which evolved into Sorbenots.Jason Stone, who conducts employee training sessions, also emphasizes the importance of consistency, both in training employees and in the way he and Phil roast the coffee beans at the company's Baker City roastery.Sorbenots starts with top quality Arabica coffee beans purchased from a California broker. The green coffee beans arrive in 150-pound burlap sacks marked with labels denoting the country of origin, including Colombia, Guatemala, Tanzania and Kenya.The green beans are roasted in 25-pound batches in a Diedfrich coffee roaster until they reach a temperature ranging from 452 degrees to 472 degrees, depending on the type of beans and coffee. For French roast coffee the beans are roasted at 472 degrees for richer flavor and darker color, or at 452 degrees for the full city roast, which comes out lighter in color and has more caffeine.\\\"We get lots of compliments on our coffee. I think it's mainly due to the roasting process developed by our parents (Robin and Donna Stone),\\\" who, Jason said, did most of the roasting during the company's first 12 years.\\\"With small-batch roasting you catch the little things, like over-roasted beans,\\\" Jason said.During a typical week, the Stones roast about 600 pounds of beans at their roasting plant in Baker City. That includes 400 pounds of beans used to make coffee drinks at their five shops, and 200 pounds sold to commercial customers, including the Geiser Grand Hotel, Baker City Cafe, Quail Ridge Golf Course and others including the Earth and Vine art gallery and wine bar, which is the first place in town serving what Jason Stone calls French press coffee.\\\"It's unique and it's an experience. You order it and you can press it yourself at your table,\\\" Jason said.At Sorbenots, customers' coffee isn't brewed in a drip coffee pot or coffee maker. Instead, each cup is brewed individually to order using the Americana method.Even during the recession this past year, Phil Stone said sales growth has averaged 5 percent to 10 percent at each location except Ontario, where sales have held steady.\\\"We are concerned about the economy, but right now we are having our busiest year,\\\" Phil said.He said 2001 -- the year of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- was the only year the Sorbenots chain experienced an overall decline in sales of coffee drinks.\\\"I think we are a little bit insulated in Eastern Oregon, and specifically in Baker City, from the national economy,\\\" Phil said. \\\"We've gone through the timber industry decline and I think the communities of Eastern Oregon are more stable than other areas that got caught up in the big boom/bust cycle.\\\"The company reaches out to tourists, but Phil said Sorbenots' employee training and customer service strategy focuses on keeping local customers happy.\\\"It's truly our local clientele that is the key to our vitality,\\\" Stone said.Phil said he strives to hire efficient, personable employees and provide them with training, while Andrea handles most of the marketing, including the design on coffee cups, to-go boxes, the company logo and writing press releases.The Stones moved from their original trailer into the current Baker City location on East Campbell Street in 1996, and opened their second store in La Grande that same year followed by Ontario in 1998, Pendleton in 2003 and Hermiston in 2004.\\\"Our fourth location in Pendleton opened in August of 2003 and showed profitability the first day we opened,\\\" said Andrea Stone. \\\"Projections show that Pendleton will likely exceed the sales volume of any of our other locations.\\\"Hermiston mirrored and exceeded the profitability curve of Pendleton,\\\" she said.With coffee shops in five towns, the Stones promoted longtime employee Corey Smith to regional sales manager to oversee all five drive-throughs.\\\"Corey does the deliveries to all five stores and oversees all the managers,\\\" Andrea said, adding, \\\"a lot of our managers have been with us a long time.\\\"Although Sorbenots sells cinnamon rolls, bagels and other edibles, Andrea said 89 percent of the company's sales are generated through drive-through coffee orders.\\\"We have ventured into and back out of additional food and product sales, but we found that including additional product lines often confuses the type of business which we're striving to achieve,\\\" she said.All Sorbenots stores are open from 5:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily.Between 2003 and 2005 the Stones attempted to open Sorbenots Coffee drive-throughs in Flagstaff, Ariz., and Greeley, Colo.After several trips to Arizona the Stones dropped the idea of opening an espresso shop there. However, in 2006 they did open a shop in Greeley. Phil Stone said after losing $6,000 a month they closed it and decided to stick closer to home, for the time being.\\\"In the end the Greeley shop never took off,\\\" Phil said. \\\"The demographics looked good. The incomes looked good, but what we didn't realize was their incomes were all taken up with payments on houses, cars, boats and things.\\\"They didn't have enough disposable income, even with two people working,\\\" Phil said.Now they're looking to expand whole bean roasting and wholesale sales. Phil said future growth plans now target wholesale coffee marketing and Internet sales.\\\"We hired Chelsea McLagan as a commercial sales and online sales rep,\\\" he said.With McLagan on board, Phil said Sorbenots is picking up quite a few restaurants, hotels and other businesses that now buy Sorbenots coffee.The Stones' mother, Donna Stone, formerly of La Dolce Vita, an Italian phrase meaning \\\"The Sweet Life,\\\" was the head coffee roaster for Sorbenots from 1996 through 2004.

       "      <td>A prominent plant biologist says that biofuels are only one part of a green energy solution.Much hope for an affordable clean-energy solution has been placed on the potential of biofuels like ethanol. Stanford University's Chris Somerville, director of the Carnegie Institution's department of plant biology, shares that optimism - but also says that technologies are improving the prospects of a whole range of alternative energies. He spoke with Newsweek's Fareed Zakaria last week in Washington, D.C. Excerpts:Zakaria: Are biofuels going to get us out of the energy trap?Somerville: It's not a silver bullet. We need a broad basket of solutions. But it certainly can be important - if we could obtain 1 percent solar efficiency on 1 percent of the land in the world, that would be enough to provide all transportation fuels, or about 20 percent of our total energy use.Q: What would that mean exactly?A: It turns out that many plants, such as sugar cane, actually capture more than 1 percent of the solar energy that strikes them. In fact, the theoretical efficiency for plants is above 6 percent, and some plants will do around 3 percent. To give you a sense of how much 1 percent of the world is - it's about 13 billion hectares. So 130 million hectares would be enough at 1 percent efficiency. The Brazilians say they can devote 40 million hectares to sugar cane.Q: One of the big problems with almost every alternative energy source is that to get to a large-enough scale, it will require huge investments to meet our needs.A: The secretary of energy's goal, as I understand it, is to obtain about 30 percent of our transportation fuels from bio by 2030. That's on the order of 60 billion gallons, and would require a very large number of facilities distributed around the U.S. [But] it certainly can be done.Q: The rap against corn-based ethanol is that it takes more energy to produce than it generates. Is that true?A: That's probably not true. The best analyses that I've seen say that it's energy-positive. But there's an upper limit to what it's going to contribute, and probably that's in the 12 to 15 billion-gallon range.Q: How do you come out on this issue of the subsidies for corn-based ethanol?A: [Subsidies are] absolutely unnecessary. It looks to me from the price of ethanol and the cost of production that it's still profitable, even without a subsidy. Four years ago, ethanol was selling at $1 a gallon. And at that price, it was necessary. Then ethanol hit $3.50 a gallon about two years ago - at which time farmers were paying off their ethanol plants in a single year.Q: And what about cellulosic fuel, which is drawn from the whole plant, not just the grains?A: We can actually make compounds that look a lot more like biodiesel and biopetrol from fermentation of cellulosics, and I think that within 10 years, we'll actually have not only cellulosic fuels but cellulosic fuels that look just like our current diesel and gasoline fuels.Q: How so?A: They'll displace them chemically, with very similar properties. But they will actually be net carbon-neutral - and that's very important because one of the challenges in the current biofuels economy is that we have 240 million vehicles in this country. Only about 5 million of them will burn more than 10 percent ethanol, and we don't have a distribution system for vast amounts of ethanol. So ultimately, the biofuel we want is something that looks a lot more like the fuels we are currently using.Q: What other alternative energies and solutions do you think are important?A: Wind is very underexploited. We could get about a third of our global needs with wind. You just have to put up lots of turbines, and they are big. But they are quite cost-effective. There's quite a bit of capacity in geothermal - extracting heat from deep in the earth to generate electricity. That's rather underdeveloped at present. I also think there's some really important opportunities in geological sequestration - that is, taking fossil fuels and separating the hydrogen from the carbon and then pumping the carbon dioxide back into deep saline aquifers, and then using the hydrogen for various types of fuels.Q: Do you think you can do that with coal to create clean coal?A: Yes. We have to. We have to solve the problem of emissions from coal.Q: Do you see the hydrogen economy as the future?A: I'm not sure. I actually think the future is a basket of technologies. Wind certainly has to be in our future. Geothermal can last indefinitely. Biofuels are certainly a part of it. So there's lots of opportunities.Q: Where does America stand in this? The European Union has instituted many more regulations and standards requiring clean energy.A: Europe is ahead of us in several technologies. Wind really began in Europe, although since General Electric has gotten into it, it's [been] moving to the United States in a good way. Germany made a large government investment in solar. In biofuels, technically we're the leader, and I think this year we'll pull ahead of Brazil in terms of actual production. Right now the U.S. looks to me as though there's a very robust sort of groundswell of entrepreneurial and technical activity. Clean tech is sweeping Silicon Valley.Q: You sound pretty optimistic.A: I've been deeply involved in the technical aspects of this for some years, and everywhere I look, I see opportunity. It doesn't require any miracles. There's still time for us to achieve improvements or implementation of alternative energies before the problem becomes really a crisis. [But] there is a crisis coming if we don't do something, and the crisis is not widely understood. It's really a political crisis that will be caused by changes in rainfall patterns around the world that cause people to migrate on a massive scale. It's not the drowning polar bears that are the real problem, it's the people who won't be able to feed themselves because of changing rainfall patterns.Zakaria is editor of Newsweek International.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, as it has since June, but it was more optimistic than in the past that inflationary pressures were ebbing.  The central bank left the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks at 5.25 percent, as investors had expected. It also repeated its caution that ''some inflation risks remain,'' a sign that it is likely to keep the benchmark rate at current levels for the foreseeable future.But in its statement announcing the decision, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee expressed growing confidence that inflation was running lower -- even as growth was slightly stronger than officials had expected just a few months ago.  ''Readings on core inflation have improved modestly, and inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time,'' the Fed's statement said. At the same time, it acknowledged signs of ''somewhat firmer economic growth'' and ''tentative signs of stabilization'' in the housing market.  That cheered stock and bond markets, elevating hopes that healthy economic growth would not prompt a resumption of rate increases. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.38 points yesterday, or 0.79 percent, to close at 12,621.69. Yields on Treasury debt declined, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settling at 4.81 percent, down from 4.87 percent Tuesday, indicating that the market expected long-term interest rates to move slightly lower.  The Federal Reserve's announcement came hours after the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at a surprisingly brisk annual pace of 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006.   Many investors have all but written off expectations that the Fed might actually cut interest rates soon, which it would do to offset an economic slump or rising unemployment, neither of which is occurring.  The Fed statement suggested that policy makers were increasingly confident about achieving an elusive ''soft landing'' -- a mild slowdown in growth that would reduce inflation pressures but not set off a recession.  ''What I don't think people were counting on was the Fed, in effect, upgrading their views on the outlook for inflation,'' said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh. ''The way they phrased it, they're really inching toward a balanced risk assessment of inflation versus slower growth.''  While Mr. Hoffman still says that a Fed rate cut this summer is possible, most analysts no longer see any need for the central bank to ease rates.   ''If there were need for stimulus, the consumer is clearly not asking for it,'' said Richard Yamarone at Argus Research in New York. ''You have more than a handful of reasons to raise rates, but what are the reasons for a cut? There are none.''  The Fed repeated verbatim the previous stance of remaining slightly more worried about rising inflation than about slowing growth.  Several governors, as well as the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have said that their ''comfort zone'' for inflation is an annual rate of 1 to 2 percent, excluding food and energy.  By that measure of core inflation, consumer prices have risen 2.4 percent in the last year. But prices have climbed more slowly in recent months, partly because of pass-through effects from the drop in gasoline prices late last year.   And while the Commerce Department's new estimate of economic growth last quarter provided additional evidence that the economy was expanding faster than many analysts had expected, it also showed that inflationary pressures remained surprisingly low.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Warren Buffett'sMidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. struck a deal to buy Constellation Energy Group Inc.for $4.7 billion Thursday, acquiring the cash-strapped energy firm for a fraction of its previous value.Constellation, the country's largest wholesale power marketer, said in a statement that it has a tentative deal to sell all of its outstanding shares to MidAmerican, a Des Moines, Iowa-based unit of Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Corp., for $26.50 apiece, far less than the Baltimore-based company's 52-week high share price of $107.97.\"Money is king in the current environment,\" said Angie Storozynski, an analyst with Macquerie Capital in New York.\"MidAmerican is getting amazing assets at a fraction of their value; probably at 25 percent of the fair valuation of their assets,\" she said. \"Granted, in the current environment, fair valuation means much less than liquidity. It's a steal. \"The news of the sale came after Constellation took a three-day walloping on the stock market, losing 58 percent of its share value since Monday. Investors worried that Constellation's commodities-trading business would not be able to secure financing as lending contracted on Wall Street. Constellation said Wednesday that it had hired Morgan Stanley and UBS to evaluate strategic alternatives, which could have included selling off parts or all of the company, to try to calm investor fears.The company's credit rating came into question Wednesday when Standard &amp;amp; Poor's put Constellation on a watch list, saying it could downgrade the company several notches if it did not find a buyer or raise equity. A downgrade would have forced Constellation to produce anywhere from $600 million to $3 billion in collateral, which it did not have.Constellation and MidAmerican plan to enter into a definitive merger by the end of the day Friday. Following the completion of the merger, Constellation will get a $1 billion cash infusion from the sale of preferred stock to MidAmerican, a provider of electric and natural gas service to 6.9 million customers worldwide, including the Midwest and the United Kingdom. The deal should be completed within nine months.\"We strongly believe this transaction is in the best long-term interest of our investors, employees and the customers and communities we serve,\" said Mayo A. Shattuck III, chairman and chief executive of Constellation, in a statement.The merger is subject to local, state, federal and shareholder regulatory approvals. The Maryland Public Service Commission said in a statement that it will review the merger request when it is filed \"to determine whether the proposed transaction is consistent with public interest. \"Staying in BaltimoreConstellation will remain independently run and will stay in Baltimore, said Gregory E. Abel, president and CEO of MidAmerican.\"We intend, as with all of our investments, to allow Constellation Energy to operate autonomously as it pursues its long-term goals,\" he said in a statement.Abel said during a Thursday afternoon news conference that management's status - including Shattuck's - is uncertain. If MidAmerican fired Shattuck, he would walk away with $47 million.However, Paul Justice, an analyst with Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, said that management is generally spared in Berkshire mergers.\"Berkshire's particular practice is to keep the management intact and to let them operate independently,\" he said. \"[Warren Buffett] has no desire to run day-to-day activity there. He holds Mayo Shattuck and the team, as he should, in high regard. \"In 2006, Florida's FPL Group nearly bought Constellation, the parent of Baltimore Gas &amp;amp; Electric Co., but the companies scrapped the $12.4 billion deal because of uncertainties with regulatory approvals. The proposed deal came at in inauspicious time when the rate caps imposed during deregulation were being lifted, and BGE was asking for a 72 percent rate hike.Analysts said the commission would likely be more receptive this time around because of concern for Constellation's viability.\"Many times if you have a utility that's not distressed, regulators may step in and make sure that ratepayers are realizing some of the benefits,\" Justice said.\"In the case of a distressed parent, survival is paramount to saving a few pennies on an electric bill,\" he said. \"I would imagine that the financial strength of Berkshire Hathaway would make regulators view this deal positively. \"Concern over BGEBut Anirban Basu, chairman and CEO of Sage Policy Group in Baltimore, said regulators and legislators should be concerned with the fate of BGE.\"The big thing is what happens to BGE because it could be spun off?\" Basu said. \"What happens to rates? ...One could ask all kinds of different question here. One would hope that Maryland's highest policymakers, that's what they're focused on today. \"Sen. E.J. Pipkin, R-Upper Shore, said with the sale of Constellation, Gov. Martin O'Malley should try to bring its power plants back under regulation.\"The General Assembly basically doesn't have a lot to say, so the governor needs to step in and make this happen,\" Pipkin said.Constellation has often battled with the state, but in the spring O'Malley engineered a $2 billion settlement with the company, putting to rest disputes over the 1999 legislation that deregulated energy market. BGE's 1.1 million residential customers were given one-time $170 rebates.O'Malley praised the Constellation deal during a visit to a school in Severna Park Thursday.\"It was probably a much better result than what would have happened without this sort of action for Constellation shareholders,\" he said. \"You couldn't find a more reputable and stronger white knight than Warren Buffett. \"Constellation took a beating this week when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy, and investors worried that the company would suffer because it has a line of credit from the investment banking house, although it said the line was worth $150 million out of its $6.13 billion in credit, and the bankruptcy would not harm its well-being.\"The financial services sector and energy commodity markets have witnessed unprecedented volatility,\" Shattuck said in the statement. \"Backed by the significant industry expertise and financial stability of MidAmerican and Berkshire Hathaway, Constellation Energy will build on its reputation as a first-choice energy solution provider for our many customers. \"Constellation's ratings problems began in August, when the company said it had miscalculated the amount of collateral it would need if it was downgraded. That accounting error pushed Fitch Ratings and S&amp;amp;P to cut Constellation's rating from \"BBB+\" to \"BBB. \" The share price of the company's stock slipped 16 percent and it had to raise $106 million in collateral.\"Constellation has a basket of extremely valuable assets,\" Morningstar's Justice said. \"They ran into an unfortunate situation with their overstretched balance sheet. This is an enhancement for Berkshire Hathaway.\"Without the current collateral crisis that has quickly unfolded at Constellation, the company has extremely valuable assets, a strong trading book, a well-positioned merchant generation business in the capacity-constrained Northeast. \"'Pleasantly surprised'The deal \"pleasantly surprised\" Del. Dereck Davis, a Democrat from Prince Georges.\"In light of the global economy you're looking at over the last year and specifically this last week, you're looking at corporate giants just fall by the wayside,\" Davis said. \"This is a very tenuous time for the economy, and when you look at a company like Constellation, it's one of our largest employers. Their overall financial health and vitality is very important to Maryland. \"Davis, who chairs the House Economic Matters Committee, said the legislature would do its job and study the deal, but not try to fight it.\"We're just going to let everybody do their jobs,\" he said. \"We have a dual purpose here, we want to make sure the citizens are protected and Constellation is protected. We certainly don't want to stand in anyone's way, but we will do our due diligence. \"Constellation employed 10,200 people at the end of last year, with 6,768 of those in Maryland. It was one of six Fortune 500 companies in the state, and joins a growing number of firms once based in Maryland to leave or get bought out.EDF an also-ranAside from MidAmerican, Paris-based Electricite de France SA was considered to be in the running to purchase Constellation. The government-run nuclear power company said in a statement Thursday that it had not moved forward because \"all the conditions are not met to do so. \"EDF nearly doubled its stake in Constellation this month to 9.51 percent, becoming the energy company's largest shareholder. The purchase was part of a July 2007 joint-venture agreement by the companies to develop nuclear power plants in the United States, called UniStar Nuclear.Constellation previously said it would make a decision about adding a third nuclear reactor to its set at Calvert Cliffs next year.MidAmerican has been interested in getting into nuclear power, according to Morningstar's Justice, and when the purchase of Constellation is completed, the company will have several nuclear reactors in its arsenal at a relatively low price.Cost estimates for the new Calvert Cliffs reactor were roughly $6 billion, a price tag that would have been a burden for a company like Constellation, but would not be a problem for a company owned by Berkshire Hathaway, he said.\"One of Berkshire's biggest problems is that it has too much cash on hand, which is a good problem to have today,\" Justice said. \"The issue in making nuclear investments is that these projects are too expensive. This could be a good way for Berkshire to spend massive amounts of capital at potentially attractive returns. \"Shares of Constellation's stock ended the day down 57 cents, or 2.3 percent, at $24.20.The Associated Press contributed to this article.</td>\n",

He said about all of the employees who were laid off because of the idling in production have been brought back this week. The furnace was idled last fall.Hargrove said it's difficult to say whether the restart is just a \\\"blip on the screen\\\" of economic recovery or whether it will be sustained.\\\"We're hoping so,\\\" Hargrove said. \\\"We're optimistic, but we really haven't seen the signals yet. It's just a lack of orders. Even though starting the furnace is a good thing, they're (ArcelorMittal) only running three out of nine (blast furnaces) in the country.\\\"However, bar company employees at the facility are facing layoffs this month after ArcelorMittal announced it was going to temporarily idle production at the electric furnace and the 12-inch bar mill.Production was idled because of a lack of orders, and ArcelorMittal said in a statement the layoffs were a result of the economic downturn that caused a drop in demand. A large part of the products manufactured from this operation go to the automotive industry.Hargrove said a number of the 300 to 400 employees affected by the layoffs may be able to work in agreements at the neighboring Indiana Harbor West facility or be cross-trained for different plant positions. USW Local 1010 represents about 3,500 employees at Indiana Harbor East.Hargrove said the reduced production at steel mills has helped lower inventories at steel service centers, but the recent increase in orders may mean businesses are making purchases before prices are increased.Blast furnace No. 6 remains idled at Indiana Harbor East. ArcelorMittal's blast furnace No. 7, which is still in operation, has the largest steel production capacity in the Western hemisphere, Hargrove said. Blast furnace No. 5 can produce 3,000 tons of crude steel per day while the No. 7 furnace can produce up to 11,500 tons of crude steel daily.To see more of The Times, Munster, Ind., or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.nwitimes.com.

with the ***recession**, monterey county farmers are holding their own.\\\"agriculture tends to be noncyclical,\\\" said steve seldomridge, a senior vice president of wells fargo bank in monterey.the gross value of monterey county agriculture products was up in 2008 by one tenth of a percent, a year after a 9.5 percent increase.\\\"we suffer more when we overproduce\\\" and prices go down, said john hillen, a vice president of rabobank in salinas. \\\"we have a lot of good, stable production here.\\\"the rising fuel prices that hit their peak last year made things tough on farmers. fuel is one-quarter to one-third of a farmer's cost, seldomridge said.even with fuel prices down substantially from a year ago, farmers are looking for ways to conserve fuel, hillen said.consumers shifted their food-buying habits during the ***recession**. that has meant more sales of fresh, unprocessed foods and fewer high-priced items.both bankers say monterey county winemakers and grape growers have seen a decline in sales for higher-priced wines.\\\"people aren't drinking less wine,\\\" seldomridge said.while farmers are holding their own, they're generally not putting money into expansion.\\\"there's a lot of caution out there,\\\" seldomridge said.hillen of rabobank said there's more land for sale now.a few years ago, seldomridge of wells fargo said, growers sometimes had trouble finding enough workers. but when the economyis down, he said, there's not a shortage of workers.to see more of the monterey county herald, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to

                                                       c(\"dec. 23--a st. louis-based business bank quietly entered the east valley earlier this month by acquiring valley capital bank in mesa.on dec. 11, valley capital bank, national association, mesa, was closed by the office of the comptroller of the currency, which appointed the federal deposit insurance corp.as receiver. the fdic then entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with enterprise bank &amp; trust to assume all of valley capital's deposits.valley capital, a business bank, opened in 2007 near stapley drive and baseline road in mesa. as of sept. 30, it had about $40.3 million in total assets and about $41.3 million in deposits.valley capital was struggling because of significant losses in its acquisition, development and construction portfolio, said greg hernandez, fdic spokesman.\\\"you couple that with a weak real estate market and the bank failed,\\\" he said. \\\"the bank was put on the fdic's problem institution list in january and became insolvent as of sept. 30.\\\"enterprise bank &amp; trust paid the fdic a 2 percent premium for the right to assume all of valley capital's deposits. in addition, it agreed to purchase all of the failed bank's assets.enterprise bank &amp; trust focuses on middle-market, family-owned businesses. its holding company has $2.2 billion in assets and its wealth management segment has more than $1 billion under management.\\\"all of the deposits that we acquired at valley capital bank ... are safe and secured,\\\" said jack barry, arizona market president for enterprise bank &amp; trust. \\\"despite the downturn, we're very bullish on arizona and the southwest, and in particular the metro phoenix area, and we think it offers a lot of opportunity for growth. hopefully, we'll be in a position to maximize that opportunity.\\\"enterprise bank &amp; trust opened a loan production office two years ago in phoenix, and originally was pursuing a de novo charter from the fdic to open a full-service bank in arizona, he said. a de novo charter is a license to open a bank.\\\"but with the ***economic downturn**, basically the fdic had really stopped issuing de novo charters, and subsequent to that we then set about trying to find an entry point to get a bank charter because you have to obtain a local bank charter in order to do full banking business,\\\" barry said. \\\"our criteria was to find a relatively low-risk acquisition ... and just recently we were presented with this opportunity by the fdic. we did it a little different than originally planned, but we got to the same objective.\\\"valley capital's business was \\\"heavily commercial real estate oriented,\\\" while enterprise bank &amp; trust strikes \\\"more of a balance between real estate and commercial/industrial operating companies,\\\" he said.\\\"they were relatively young ... and i think unfortunately they just kind of walked right into a significant real estate turn,\\\" barry said.the mesa bank is now enterprise bank &amp; trust, and it's business as usual for its customers, he said.\\\"we are examining our opportunities to open other branches,\\\" barry said. \\\"in the near term, we will look to expand with other branches in the central phoenix area on the camelback corridor and also in the far west valley area.\\\"to see more of the tribune,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    for people lacking health insurance in the washington region, where they live can make all the difference in getting affordable health care.the district makes it easy, with its taxpayer-funded health insurance for everyone  within generous income restrictions. but about 10 percent of eligible adults remain uninsured, and the city wants to find and enroll them.at the other end of the spectrum is prince george's county, where recent census bureau statistics show that one in five working-age adults is uninsured. many are the working poor, who have to choose between getting a checkup and buying groceries. five free clinics in the county  treated 6,000  people last year, a small fraction of the uninsured.the census statistics underscore wide regional differences in how many people are uninsured. health-care professionals say there also are gaps in health, measured by such data as how many people are tested for serious diseases and how many children are born prematurely. a report this spring by the metropolitan washington council of governments found that average life expectancy ranged from 72 in the district to 81 in montgomery county.a lack of health insurance is not the only factor determining whether people have access to care. but many clinics that provide free or low-cost health care to low-income residents say they are flooded with people who have let their health slide, often for years, because they have no insurance.\"free clinics are not adequate to address the need,\" said kelley woodward, medical director of the alexandria health department and the lead doctor for  cog's report on community health status indicators. \"there's a huge shortage of services for people without health insurance. the clinics are all overwhelmed.\"of particular concern are adults 18 to 64. children can be covered under federal and state programs, and seniors get medicare. most adults get no help. clinics report a sharp increase during the ***recession** in the working poor and unemployed patients.\"they're people who had really good jobs and who have lost really everything,\" said michelle schuler, executive director of the free clinic in prince william county, where 17 percent of working-age adults are uninsured. \"it's humbling for them to have to ask for help. they think the situation is going to change, and so they go without their medications for hypertension or diabetes. by the time they realize things aren't turning around and they come to us, they're very sick.\"some of the area's most affluent counties have relatively high numbers of uninsured residents. in montgomery, 16 percent of working-age adults lack insurance, according to the census estimates. in fairfax, it's 13 percent.prince george's has the most. donald shell, head of the health department, estimates that 150,000 of the county's 820,000 residents, including children and the elderly, are uninsured.\"prince george's is in a quagmire,\" shell said. \"many residents, though they are employed, have incomes too high to qualify for medicaid.\" so some go without insurance.residents earning more than $27,562 for a family of four do not qualify for care at one of the five clinics run in the county by greater baden medical services, a nonprofit group. \"so many people are, like, a dollar over the cutoff,\" said sarah leonard, executive director of greater baden. \"we have a lot of people struggling to get by in an area where living costs are high, and they're not able to get coverage. so they just don't get care at all.\"shell said the county is considering opening a primary-care clinic at the county hospital, where the uninsured could seek care for one-fifth the cost of going to the emergency room.costs have waylaid many a plan.only an infusion of $1.2 million in federal stimulus money kept the prince william community health center from closing its doors. the center served 6,000 people last year, director liz sykes said. many are jobless or uninsured working poor who have part-time or entry-level jobs. at the free clinic, which is open two nights a week, schuler said she has seen more homeless patients in the past seven months than in the previous 15 years.montgomery set an ambitious goal of caring for 40,000 uninsured residents -- half the estimated total -- at a network of \"safety net\" clinics. five years later, the county is halfway there and the clinics have waiting lists.county council member george leventhal (d-at large), who heads the panel's health and human services committee, said most of the uninsured are working-class people and recent immigrants. council member duchy trachtenberg (d-at large) said a growing number are divorced women 55 to 64. many forgo health insurance in the face of more pressing needs.\"the cost of living is so high,\" leventhal said. \"if you're making discretionary decisions, you pay the rent or groceries or health insurance.\"the district boasts the most comprehensive health coverage in the region -- and some of the biggest health challenges. it has the region's highest rates of low birth  weights, premature births, breast cancer, heart disease and aids, for example.julie hudman, head of the city's health care finance department, said the district has fewer uninsured adults because of its high eligibility levels. its healthcare alliance program covers almost 55,000 adults who make up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or $36,620 for a family of three. fully a third of the adults in the city are covered under alliance or medicaid.under alliance, patients have no premiums and no cost sharing. prescription drugs cost the patient $1. everyone is eligible, including newly arrived and undocumented immigrants.\"our goal is to have everyone covered,\" hudman said. a survey is being done to determine why some people haven't enrolled.woodward, who headed the cog study, said hospitals are providing a lot of primary care that the clinics cannot handle, particularly in emergency rooms.\"having a fifth of adults without health insurance is a huge problem,\" he said. \"having people in our community who don't have the health care they need while others readily have access to it is not a comfortable thing for me as a physician.\"   \n",

in crude-oil costs - which spiked above $135 a barrel at one point last week - are now pushing airlines and truckers to the brink, forcing many consumers to say they are staying home this holiday weekend, and recharging fears of ***recession** in the face of $4-a-gallon gasoline. it's a supply-demand problem on steroids. here are five possible solutions, along with the outlook for each. solution no. 1:  reduce world demand for oil. outlook: very unlikely. but oil supplies haven't changed much over the last five years, so why not simply throttle back demand? well, who isn't trying? hybrid cars and fluorescent bulbs help. but as the saying goes, the genie is out of the bottle. oil demand, particularly from china, continues to skyrocket. at the same time, efforts to switch to alternative fuels continue to stumble - and are short-term losers. converting corn to ethanol is making food more expensive, and scarce, some experts say. building more nuclear power stations would take years. solar and wind power? planners are just waking up to the huge amounts of real estate the current technologies would consume to reach meaningful outputs. solution no. 2: pump more  oil out of the ground. outlook: not likely for decades. the international energy agency, which is based in paris, said last week that oil companies might be incapable of keeping up with demand for the next 20 years. the opec oil cartel is disinclined to try harder, and some of its officials even question whether there is a supply shortage. on thursday, opec secretary-general abdullah al-badri pointed a finger at market speculation and the weak dollar to explain high crude prices. \"even if we increase output tomorrow, the prices will not come down, because of speculation and because of a weak dollar,\" he said. \"when we see there is a shortage of supply, we will act.\" solution no. 3: pop the speculation bubble. outlook: try changing human nature. if wild speculation is the problem, let's round up those naughty traders and bus them to chester and bensalem to bet the slots and ponies instead of the price of a barrel of crude. but then what? speculators, who never intend to take possession of a barrel of oil, are simply paying what they think that barrel will be worth at some future date. they're taking into account all the same fundamental factors that have propelled the price of oil up for the last six years. solution no. 4: strengthen the weak dollar. outlook: this could happen in coming months. the federal reserve has signaled that it doesn't see further interest-rate cuts for now, and opec president chakib khelil told reuters last week that a 10 percent gain in the dollar probably would result in a 40 percent drop in oil prices. this is largely because oil futures are traded in dollars, and a weak dollar makes oil less expensive to buyers dealing in other currencies. meanwhile, the price of oil has tended to slip on any day that the dollar strengthens against the euro. economists still disagree, though, on how best to shore up the dollar and about what effect that would have on the overall economy. instead, the fed has been trying to stave off ***recession** and solve a credit crisis by lowering key interest rates. solution no. 5:  a big, bad ***recession**. outlook: sadly, this could happen, regardless of the efforts of the fed, stimulus checks and anything else. and it is oil that could finally tip the economy into ***recession**. experts say gasoline prices have yet to catch up with the spike in crude, and $200-a-barrel oil, which some officials say is possible in the next two years, could cost $6 per gallon at the gas pump. chances are, that'll do the trick. contact staff writer reid kanaley at 215-854-5114 or

To make ends meet during the winter months and slow fire seasons they started a sandwich shop in 1995 called Little Joe's Cafe and later opened Cappuccino Cowboy, which evolved into Sorbenots.Jason Stone, who conducts employee training sessions, also emphasizes the importance of consistency, both in training employees and in the way he and Phil roast the coffee beans at the company's Baker City roastery.Sorbenots starts with top quality Arabica coffee beans purchased from a California broker. The green coffee beans arrive in 150-pound burlap sacks marked with labels denoting the country of origin, including Colombia, Guatemala, Tanzania and Kenya.The green beans are roasted in 25-pound batches in a Diedfrich coffee roaster until they reach a temperature ranging from 452 degrees to 472 degrees, depending on the type of beans and coffee. For French roast coffee the beans are roasted at 472 degrees for richer flavor and darker color, or at 452 degrees for the full city roast, which comes out lighter in color and has more caffeine.\\\"We get lots of compliments on our coffee. I think it's mainly due to the roasting process developed by our parents (Robin and Donna Stone),\\\" who, Jason said, did most of the roasting during the company's first 12 years.\\\"With small-batch roasting you catch the little things, like over-roasted beans,\\\" Jason said.During a typical week, the Stones roast about 600 pounds of beans at their roasting plant in Baker City. That includes 400 pounds of beans used to make coffee drinks at their five shops, and 200 pounds sold to commercial customers, including the Geiser Grand Hotel, Baker City Cafe, Quail Ridge Golf Course and others including the Earth and Vine art gallery and wine bar, which is the first place in town serving what Jason Stone calls French press coffee.\\\"It's unique and it's an experience. You order it and you can press it yourself at your table,\\\" Jason said.At Sorbenots, customers' coffee isn't brewed in a drip coffee pot or coffee maker. Instead, each cup is brewed individually to order using the Americana method.Even during the recession this past year, Phil Stone said sales growth has averaged 5 percent to 10 percent at each location except Ontario, where sales have held steady.\\\"We are concerned about the economy, but right now we are having our busiest year,\\\" Phil said.He said 2001 -- the year of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- was the only year the Sorbenots chain experienced an overall decline in sales of coffee drinks.\\\"I think we are a little bit insulated in Eastern Oregon, and specifically in Baker City, from the national economy,\\\" Phil said. \\\"We've gone through the timber industry decline and I think the communities of Eastern Oregon are more stable than other areas that got caught up in the big boom/bust cycle.\\\"The company reaches out to tourists, but Phil said Sorbenots' employee training and customer service strategy focuses on keeping local customers happy.\\\"It's truly our local clientele that is the key to our vitality,\\\" Stone said.Phil said he strives to hire efficient, personable employees and provide them with training, while Andrea handles most of the marketing, including the design on coffee cups, to-go boxes, the company logo and writing press releases.The Stones moved from their original trailer into the current Baker City location on East Campbell Street in 1996, and opened their second store in La Grande that same year followed by Ontario in 1998, Pendleton in 2003 and Hermiston in 2004.\\\"Our fourth location in Pendleton opened in August of 2003 and showed profitability the first day we opened,\\\" said Andrea Stone. \\\"Projections show that Pendleton will likely exceed the sales volume of any of our other locations.\\\"Hermiston mirrored and exceeded the profitability curve of Pendleton,\\\" she said.With coffee shops in five towns, the Stones promoted longtime employee Corey Smith to regional sales manager to oversee all five drive-throughs.\\\"Corey does the deliveries to all five stores and oversees all the managers,\\\" Andrea said, adding, \\\"a lot of our managers have been with us a long time.\\\"Although Sorbenots sells cinnamon rolls, bagels and other edibles, Andrea said 89 percent of the company's sales are generated through drive-through coffee orders.\\\"We have ventured into and back out of additional food and product sales, but we found that including additional product lines often confuses the type of business which we're striving to achieve,\\\" she said.All Sorbenots stores are open from 5:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily.Between 2003 and 2005 the Stones attempted to open Sorbenots Coffee drive-throughs in Flagstaff, Ariz., and Greeley, Colo.After several trips to Arizona the Stones dropped the idea of opening an espresso shop there. However, in 2006 they did open a shop in Greeley. Phil Stone said after losing $6,000 a month they closed it and decided to stick closer to home, for the time being.\\\"In the end the Greeley shop never took off,\\\" Phil said. \\\"The demographics looked good. The incomes looked good, but what we didn't realize was their incomes were all taken up with payments on houses, cars, boats and things.\\\"They didn't have enough disposable income, even with two people working,\\\" Phil said.Now they're looking to expand whole bean roasting and wholesale sales. Phil said future growth plans now target wholesale coffee marketing and Internet sales.\\\"We hired Chelsea McLagan as a commercial sales and online sales rep,\\\" he said.With McLagan on board, Phil said Sorbenots is picking up quite a few restaurants, hotels and other businesses that now buy Sorbenots coffee.The Stones' mother, Donna Stone, formerly of La Dolce Vita, an Italian phrase meaning \\\"The Sweet Life,\\\" was the head coffee roaster for Sorbenots from 1996 through 2004. She trained Phil and Jason in the art of roasting beans, and now they're doing most of the roasting, although she is still the official master roaster.Sorbenots sells one Italian roast coffee called Soignoli's Blend, which was developed by Donna Stone and carries her maiden name.As for adding more espresso drive-throughs after the disappointment in Colorado, Phil said the the family is looking closer to home, but has not identified a sixth site yet.\\\"Never say never, but there's no place for a sixth store right now,\\\" he said.To see more of the Baker City Herald or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.bakercityherald.com.

Stanford University's Chris Somerville, director of the Carnegie Institution's department of plant biology, shares that optimism - but also says that technologies are improving the prospects of a whole range of alternative energies. He spoke with Newsweek's Fareed Zakaria last week in Washington, D.C. Excerpts:Zakaria: Are biofuels going to get us out of the energy trap?Somerville: It's not a silver bullet. We need a broad basket of solutions. But it certainly can be important - if we could obtain 1 percent solar efficiency on 1 percent of the land in the world, that would be enough to provide all transportation fuels, or about 20 percent of our total energy use.Q: What would that mean exactly?A: It turns out that many plants, such as sugar cane, actually capture more than 1 percent of the solar energy that strikes them. In fact, the theoretical efficiency for plants is above 6 percent, and some plants will do around 3 percent. To give you a sense of how much 1 percent of the world is - it's about 13 billion hectares. So 130 million hectares would be enough at 1 percent efficiency. The Brazilians say they can devote 40 million hectares to sugar cane.Q: One of the big problems with almost every alternative energy source is that to get to a large-enough scale, it will require huge investments to meet our needs.A: The secretary of energy's goal, as I understand it, is to obtain about 30 percent of our transportation fuels from bio by 2030. That's on the order of 60 billion gallons, and would require a very large number of facilities distributed around the U.S. [But] it certainly can be done.Q: The rap against corn-based ethanol is that it takes more energy to produce than it generates. Is that true?A: That's probably not true. The best analyses that I've seen say that it's energy-positive. But there's an upper limit to what it's going to contribute, and probably that's in the 12 to 15 billion-gallon range.Q: How do you come out on this issue of the subsidies for corn-based ethanol?A: [Subsidies are] absolutely unnecessary. It looks to me from the price of ethanol and the cost of production that it's still profitable, even without a subsidy. Four years ago, ethanol was selling at $1 a gallon. And at that price, it was necessary. Then ethanol hit $3.50 a gallon about two years ago - at which time farmers were paying off their ethanol plants in a single year.Q: And what about cellulosic fuel, which is drawn from the whole plant, not just the grains?A: We can actually make compounds that look a lot more like biodiesel and biopetrol from fermentation of cellulosics, and I think that within 10 years, we'll actually have not only cellulosic fuels but cellulosic fuels that look just like our current diesel and gasoline fuels.Q: How so?A: They'll displace them chemically, with very similar properties. But they will actually be net carbon-neutral - and that's very important because one of the challenges in the current biofuels economy is that we have 240 million vehicles in this country. Only about 5 million of them will burn more than 10 percent ethanol, and we don't have a distribution system for vast amounts of ethanol. So ultimately, the biofuel we want is something that looks a lot more like the fuels we are currently using.Q: What other alternative energies and solutions do you think are important?A: Wind is very underexploited. We could get about a third of our global needs with wind. You just have to put up lots of turbines, and they are big. But they are quite cost-effective. There's quite a bit of capacity in geothermal - extracting heat from deep in the earth to generate electricity. That's rather underdeveloped at present. I also think there's some really important opportunities in geological sequestration - that is, taking fossil fuels and separating the hydrogen from the carbon and then pumping the carbon dioxide back into deep saline aquifers, and then using the hydrogen for various types of fuels.Q: Do you think you can do that with coal to create clean coal?A: Yes. We have to. We have to solve the problem of emissions from coal.Q: Do you see the hydrogen economy as the future?A: I'm not sure. I actually think the future is a basket of technologies. Wind certainly has to be in our future. Geothermal can last indefinitely. Biofuels are certainly a part of it. So there's lots of opportunities.Q: Where does America stand in this? The European Union has instituted many more regulations and standards requiring clean energy.A: Europe is ahead of us in several technologies. Wind really began in Europe, although since General Electric has gotten into it, it's [been] moving to the United States in a good way. Germany made a large government investment in solar. In biofuels, technically we're the leader, and I think this year we'll pull ahead of Brazil in terms of actual production. Right now the U.S. looks to me as though there's a very robust sort of groundswell of entrepreneurial and technical activity. Clean tech is sweeping Silicon Valley.Q: You sound pretty optimistic.A: I've been deeply involved in the technical aspects of this for some years, and everywhere I look, I see opportunity. It doesn't require any miracles. There's still time for us to achieve improvements or implementation of alternative energies before the problem becomes really a crisis. [But] there is a crisis coming if we don't do something, and the crisis is not widely understood. It's really a political crisis that will be caused by changes in rainfall patterns around the world that cause people to migrate on a massive scale. It's not the drowning polar bears that are the real problem, it's the people who won't be able to feed themselves because of changing rainfall patterns.Zakaria is editor of Newsweek International.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                      The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, as it has since June, but it was more optimistic than in the past that inflationary pressures were ebbing.  The central bank left the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks at 5.25 percent, as investors had expected. It also repeated its caution that ''some inflation risks remain,'' a sign that it is likely to keep the benchmark rate at current levels for the foreseeable future.But in its statement announcing the decision, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee expressed growing confidence that inflation was running lower -- even as growth was slightly stronger than officials had expected just a few months ago.  ''Readings on core inflation have improved modestly, and inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time,'' the Fed's statement said. At the same time, it acknowledged signs of ''somewhat firmer economic growth'' and ''tentative signs of stabilization'' in the housing market.  That cheered stock and bond markets, elevating hopes that healthy economic growth would not prompt a resumption of rate increases. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.38 points yesterday, or 0.79 percent, to close at 12,621.69. Yields on Treasury debt declined, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settling at 4.81 percent, down from 4.87 percent Tuesday, indicating that the market expected long-term interest rates to move slightly lower.  The Federal Reserve's announcement came hours after the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at a surprisingly brisk annual pace of 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006.   Many investors have all but written off expectations that the Fed might actually cut interest rates soon, which it would do to offset an economic slump or rising unemployment, neither of which is occurring.  The Fed statement suggested that policy makers were increasingly confident about achieving an elusive ''soft landing'' -- a mild slowdown in growth that would reduce inflation pressures but not set off a recession.  ''What I don't think people were counting on was the Fed, in effect, upgrading their views on the outlook for inflation,'' said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh. ''The way they phrased it, they're really inching toward a balanced risk assessment of inflation versus slower growth.''  While Mr. Hoffman still says that a Fed rate cut this summer is possible, most analysts no longer see any need for the central bank to ease rates.   ''If there were need for stimulus, the consumer is clearly not asking for it,'' said Richard Yamarone at Argus Research in New York. ''You have more than a handful of reasons to raise rates, but what are the reasons for a cut? There are none.''  The Fed repeated verbatim the previous stance of remaining slightly more worried about rising inflation than about slowing growth.  Several governors, as well as the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have said that their ''comfort zone'' for inflation is an annual rate of 1 to 2 percent, excluding food and energy.  By that measure of core inflation, consumer prices have risen 2.4 percent in the last year. But prices have climbed more slowly in recent months, partly because of pass-through effects from the drop in gasoline prices late last year.   And while the Commerce Department's new estimate of economic growth last quarter provided additional evidence that the economy was expanding faster than many analysts had expected, it also showed that inflationary pressures remained surprisingly low.   \n",
       "298  Warren Buffett'sMidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. struck a deal to buy Constellation Energy Group Inc.for $4.7 billion Thursday, acquiring the cash-strapped energy firm for a fraction of its previous value.Constellation, the country's largest wholesale power marketer, said in a statement that it has a tentative deal to sell all of its outstanding shares to MidAmerican, a Des Moines, Iowa-based unit of Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Corp., for $26.50 apiece, far less than the Baltimore-based company's 52-week high share price of $107.97.\"Money is king in the current environment,\" said Angie Storozynski, an analyst with Macquerie Capital in New York.\"MidAmerican is getting amazing assets at a fraction of their value; probably at 25 percent of the fair valuation of their assets,\" she said. \"Granted, in the current environment, fair valuation means much less than liquidity. It's a steal. \"The news of the sale came after Constellation took a three-day walloping on the stock market, losing 58 percent of its share value since Monday. Investors worried that Constellation's commodities-trading business would not be able to secure financing as lending contracted on Wall Street. Constellation said Wednesday that it had hired Morgan Stanley and UBS to evaluate strategic alternatives, which could have included selling off parts or all of the company, to try to calm investor fears.The company's credit rating came into question Wednesday when Standard &amp; Poor's put Constellation on a watch list, saying it could downgrade the company several notches if it did not find a buyer or raise equity. A downgrade would have forced Constellation to produce anywhere from $600 million to $3 billion in collateral, which it did not have.Constellation and MidAmerican plan to enter into a definitive merger by the end of the day Friday. Following the completion of the merger, Constellation will get a $1 billion cash infusion from the sale of preferred stock to MidAmerican, a provider of electric and natural gas service to 6.9 million customers worldwide, including the Midwest and the United Kingdom. The deal should be completed within nine months.\"We strongly believe this transaction is in the best long-term interest of our investors, employees and the customers and communities we serve,\" said Mayo A. Shattuck III, chairman and chief executive of Constellation, in a statement.The merger is subject to local, state, federal and shareholder regulatory approvals. The Maryland Public Service Commission said in a statement that it will review the merger request when it is filed \"to determine whether the proposed transaction is consistent with public interest. \"Staying in BaltimoreConstellation will remain independently run and will stay in Baltimore, said Gregory E. Abel, president and CEO of MidAmerican.\"We intend, as with all of our investments, to allow Constellation Energy to operate autonomously as it pursues its long-term goals,\" he said in a statement.Abel said during a Thursday afternoon news conference that management's status - including Shattuck's - is uncertain. If MidAmerican fired Shattuck, he would walk away with $47 million.However, Paul Justice, an analyst with Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, said that management is generally spared in Berkshire mergers.\"Berkshire's particular practice is to keep the management intact and to let them operate independently,\" he said. \"[Warren Buffett] has no desire to run day-to-day activity there. He holds Mayo Shattuck and the team, as he should, in high regard. \"In 2006, Florida's FPL Group nearly bought Constellation, the parent of Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co., but the companies scrapped the $12.4 billion deal because of uncertainties with regulatory approvals. The proposed deal came at in inauspicious time when the rate caps imposed during deregulation were being lifted, and BGE was asking for a 72 percent rate hike.Analysts said the commission would likely be more receptive this time around because of concern for Constellation's viability.\"Many times if you have a utility that's not distressed, regulators may step in and make sure that ratepayers are realizing some of the benefits,\" Justice said.\"In the case of a distressed parent, survival is paramount to saving a few pennies on an electric bill,\" he said. \"I would imagine that the financial strength of Berkshire Hathaway would make regulators view this deal positively. \"Concern over BGEBut Anirban Basu, chairman and CEO of Sage Policy Group in Baltimore, said regulators and legislators should be concerned with the fate of BGE.\"The big thing is what happens to BGE because it could be spun off?\" Basu said. \"What happens to rates? ...One could ask all kinds of different question here. One would hope that Maryland's highest policymakers, that's what they're focused on today. \"Sen. E.J. Pipkin, R-Upper Shore, said with the sale of Constellation, Gov. Martin O'Malley should try to bring its power plants back under regulation.\"The General Assembly basically doesn't have a lot to say, so the governor needs to step in and make this happen,\" Pipkin said.Constellation has often battled with the state, but in the spring O'Malley engineered a $2 billion settlement with the company, putting to rest disputes over the 1999 legislation that deregulated energy market. BGE's 1.1 million residential customers were given one-time $170 rebates.O'Malley praised the Constellation deal during a visit to a school in Severna Park Thursday.\"It was probably a much better result than what would have happened without this sort of action for Constellation shareholders,\" he said. \"You couldn't find a more reputable and stronger white knight than Warren Buffett. \"Constellation took a beating this week when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy, and investors worried that the company would suffer because it has a line of credit from the investment banking house, although it said the line was worth $150 million out of its $6.13 billion in credit, and the bankruptcy would not harm its well-being.\"The financial services sector and energy commodity markets have witnessed unprecedented volatility,\" Shattuck said in the statement. \"Backed by the significant industry expertise and financial stability of MidAmerican and Berkshire Hathaway, Constellation Energy will build on its reputation as a first-choice energy solution provider for our many customers. \"Constellation's ratings problems began in August, when the company said it had miscalculated the amount of collateral it would need if it was downgraded. That accounting error pushed Fitch Ratings and S&amp;P to cut Constellation's rating from \"BBB+\" to \"BBB. \" The share price of the company's stock slipped 16 percent and it had to raise $106 million in collateral.\"Constellation has a basket of extremely valuable assets,\" Morningstar's Justice said. \"They ran into an unfortunate situation with their overstretched balance sheet. This is an enhancement for Berkshire Hathaway.\"Without the current collateral crisis that has quickly unfolded at Constellation, the company has extremely valuable assets, a strong trading book, a well-positioned merchant generation business in the capacity-constrained Northeast. \"'Pleasantly surprised'The deal \"pleasantly surprised\" Del. Dereck Davis, a Democrat from Prince Georges.\"In light of the global economy you're looking at over the last year and specifically this last week, you're looking at corporate giants just fall by the wayside,\" Davis said. \"This is a very tenuous time for the economy, and when you look at a company like Constellation, it's one of our largest employers. Their overall financial health and vitality is very important to Maryland. \"Davis, who chairs the House Economic Matters Committee, said the legislature would do its job and study the deal, but not try to fight it.\"We're just going to let everybody do their jobs,\" he said. \"We have a dual purpose here, we want to make sure the citizens are protected and Constellation is protected. We certainly don't want to stand in anyone's way, but we will do our due diligence. \"Constellation employed 10,200 people at the end of last year, with 6,768 of those in Maryland. It was one of six Fortune 500 companies in the state, and joins a growing number of firms once based in Maryland to leave or get bought out.EDF an also-ranAside from MidAmerican, Paris-based Electricite de France SA was considered to be in the running to purchase Constellation. The government-run nuclear power company said in a statement Thursday that it had not moved forward because \"all the conditions are not met to do so. \"EDF nearly doubled its stake in Constellation this month to 9.51 percent, becoming the energy company's largest shareholder. The purchase was part of a July 2007 joint-venture agreement by the companies to develop nuclear power plants in the United States, called UniStar Nuclear.Constellation previously said it would make a decision about adding a third nuclear reactor to its set at Calvert Cliffs next year.MidAmerican has been interested in getting into nuclear power, according to Morningstar's Justice, and when the purchase of Constellation is completed, the company will have several nuclear reactors in its arsenal at a relatively low price.Cost estimates for the new Calvert Cliffs reactor were roughly $6 billion, a price tag that would have been a burden for a company like Constellation, but would not be a problem for a company owned by Berkshire Hathaway, he said.\"One of Berkshire's biggest problems is that it has too much cash on hand, which is a good problem to have today,\" Justice said. \"The issue in making nuclear investments is that these projects are too expensive. This could be a good way for Berkshire to spend massive amounts of capital at potentially attractive returns. \"Shares of Constellation's stock ended the day down 57 cents, or 2.3 percent, at $24.20.The Associated Press contributed to this article.   \n",

some employees to work at the plant, but leave some without work within the next month.United Steelworkers Local 1010 President Tom Hargrove said it's good the company decided to restart its No. 5 blast furnace July 20. He said about all of the employees who were laid off because of the idling in production have been brought back this week. The furnace was idled last fall.Hargrove said it's difficult to say whether the restart is just a \\\"blip on the screen\\\" of economic recovery or whether it will be sustained.\\\"We're hoping so,\\\" Hargrove said. \\\"We're optimistic, but we really haven't seen the signals yet. It's just a lack of orders. Even though starting the furnace is a good thing, they're (ArcelorMittal) only running three out of nine (blast furnaces) in the country.\\\"However, bar company employees at the facility are facing layoffs this month after ArcelorMittal announced it was going to temporarily idle production at the electric furnace and the 12-inch bar mill.Production was idled because of a lack of orders, and ArcelorMittal said in a statement the layoffs were a result of the economic downturn that caused a drop in demand. A large part of the products manufactured from this operation go to the automotive industry.Hargrove said a number of the 300 to 400 employees affected by the layoffs may be able to work in agreements at the neighboring Indiana Harbor West facility or be cross-trained for different plant positions. USW Local 1010 represents about 3,500 employees at Indiana Harbor East.Hargrove said the reduced production at steel mills has helped lower inventories at steel service centers, but the recent increase in orders may mean businesses are making purchases before prices are increased.Blast furnace No. 6 remains idled at Indiana Harbor East. ArcelorMittal's blast furnace No. 7, which is still in operation, has the largest steel production capacity in the Western hemisphere, Hargrove said. Blast furnace No. 5 can produce 3,000 tons of crude steel per day while the No. 7 furnace can produce up to 11,500 tons of crude steel daily.To see more of The Times, Munster, Ind., or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.nwitimes.com.

      "202    special section  week of the nurse  even though the economy is causing a temporary slowdown in hiring nurses susan motley sees nursing as far more recessionproof than many professions  the recession has caused a temporary blip on the radar acknowledged motley ceo of the virginia nurses association  we have heard anecdotally that some recent graduates are having a little harder time finding jobs and that some hospitals have instituted hiring freezes or even in a few instances layoffs need still growing  the need for quality health care however continues to grow as the baby boomer generation ages and needs more healthrelated services nurses play a crucial role in patient health care  the united states is currently fortunate to have the most experienced nursing work force in place in its history observed motley nurses are the gatekeepers to the healthcare system and will play a key role in any federal healthcare reform efforts  since last year the number of nurses retiring from the field dropped slightly temporarily lessening the nursing shortage that has plagued the healthcare industry for the last few years  many are staying in the work force longer said shirley gibson president of the virginia nurses association and interim vice president of nursing at vcu health system also people that were not working are coming back into the work force because their spouses have lost jobs we do feel that this is a shortterm phenomenon  when the economy begins to turn upward there will be a demand for qualified nurses the vna predicts that by  the work force will be short  nurses in virginia that means that one in three citizens of the commonwealth will not have a nurse when they need one training  to  years  we have to keep people in the pipeline by graduating nurses gibson said it takes two to four years for a nurse to get out of school  one of the issues that contribute to the nursing shortage relates to education nursing class sizes are limited because of a lack of faculty motley and gibson are hoping that situation will change  virginia has made progress in increasing education capacity at our nursing schools motley said during the last five years the number of graduates has increased by  total or  percent according to the virginia board of nursing that increase can be attributed to the work of nursing schools and educators as well as the efforts of many groups including the virginia hospital amp health care association and the virginia partnership for nursing  there is no shortage of people who want to become nurses motley said even in light of the substantial increase in nursing school capacity which is something to celebrate virginias nursing schools are still turning away hundreds of qualified applicants a year now tracking nurse data  until now it has been difficult to track the instate workforce impact related to the increase in nursing graduates  we dont know if those nurses have remained in the state gibson said that is why we are fortunate to now have the health care workforce data center the last general assembly passed legislation to allow the commonwealths department of health professions to collect data from the licensed health professions the data will be collected by the health care workforce data center which was created from a workforce investment grant and formed within the last year  this is huge gibson said they will help analyze data from schools the board of nursing and other entities to help us make information out of data it will help us in understanding the nursing shortage and what we need to work on as well as how to make policy decisions joint initiative  also this year virginia was selected to be one of  state teams to participate in the robert wood johnsonaarp center to champion nursing in america because of the states strength in advocating for good healthcare policy the center is a joint initiative working to ensure that americans have the highly skilled nurses needed to provide affordable quality health care now and in the future  the center works to increase the nations capacity to educate and retain nurses explained motley it provides technical assistance and best practices models in a variety of areas to assist states in this arena the vna also works in a support capacity with the magnet consortium whose mission it is to help create an environment of nursing excellence magnet is a designation by the american nurse credentialing center facilities have to meet certain criteria to become magnet virginia has  magnet facilities  we are one of the top  states in the united states for the number of magnet facilities gibson said efforts to retain nurses  another initiative to retain nurses in the work force in virginia is the nurse leadership institute of central virginia the institute provides leadership education for nurse managers with the goal of retaining bedside nurses and improving the quality of care of nursing  its an opportunity to share solutions and values and visions from across the state explained joanne henry the institutes director  the institute had  graduates last year and  this year one graduate reported to henry that two units at her facility that had  percent turnover rates two years ago now have a less than  percent turnover rate  one has a  percent turnover rate which is phenomenal henry said we will have better data as we go forward we will get to see if the improvements are sustained  both gibson and motley are enthusiastic about the progress made in nursing in the last year  i feel that we made substantial gains in terms of establishing a workforce state center motley said i feel good about the fact that we were able to increase nursing education capacity significantly the challenge moving forward will be sustaining that \\n\n",

      "1523       chairman ben s bernanke and federal reserve policy makers who declared that inflation was their paramount challenge just two weeks ago have been forced to make financialmarket stability the trigger for changes in interest ratesby lowering the discount rate and issuing a statement conceding threats to the economy federal open market committee members effectively ripped up the economicoutlook statement from their aug  meeting some economists describe the aboutface coming after months of assurances that the subprimemortgage rout was contained as bernankes first serious error since taking office last yearit was a rookie mistake said kenneth thomas a lecturer in finance at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school in philadelphia the fed underestimated liquidity needs of investors and the fallout from the housing recession he said adding this demonstrates the difference between booksmart and streetsmartwere getting a nice further look at the new bernanke fed said ethan harris chief us economist at lehman brothers holdings incin new york he definitely wants to use the committee and these more formal directives as opposed to former fed chief greenspans preference for speeches laden with code wordsa former chairman of the economics department at princeton university bernanke has elevated the role of forecasts in fed policy rather than amassing clues from dozens of market indicators as predecessor alan greenspan didthe fed forecasts showed that moderate growth would continue and that inflation remained the biggest danger the credit collapse has undermined that stance and bernanke may cut the benchmark interest rate by at least a quarterpoint at or before the sept  fomc meeting analysts saysometimes the dynamics change very very quickly said former fed governor laurence meyer who voted for the three reductions in  after currencies in asia russia and latin america tumbled bernankes shift tells us how difficult it is to translate financial turbulence into the macroeconomic forecastthe fed on aug  lowered its discount rate  what it charges banks for direct loans  by  percentage point to  percent in an effort to increase liquidity in longerterm loans and bondsthe initial request for the move came from fed district banks in new york and san francisco they are led respectively by timothy geithner and janet yellen both former clinton administration officials who dealt with the  currency crises the feds board of governors in washington is dominated by academicsmeyer vice chairman of macroeconomic advisors llc in washington recommended prior to the aug  fomc meeting that policy makers cease describing inflation as the biggest risk by saying the risks to growth and inflation were roughly equal the central bank would have given itself room to maneuver if markets  already weakening  continued to slidethe committee said in its statement three days ago that the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably because of the tumult in markets officials abandoned the prediction of a moderate expansion and inflation wasnt mentionedwhile leaving the main rate at  percent the panel said it is prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economythe fed has an easing bias but it is not an easing bias dictated strictly by economic conditions said stephen stanley chief economist at rbs greenwich capital markets in greenwich connecticut this is a financialmarket issue which is then bleeding into the economylast weeks policy shift notwithstanding bernankes moves to resolve the credit crunch so far have been restrained even then and unlike the greenspan era it was the fed doing the talking not any one individualthe fed pumped  billion into the banking system on aug  to free up financing in shortterm credit markets and issued a sixline statement the injection was the feds biggest since the meltdown began by contrast the european central bank added  billion in temporary reserves a day earlier ecb president jeanclaude trichet followed up with media interviews designed to reassure investorslast weeks reduction in the discount rate which is used less than the federal funds rate as a policymaking tool wasnt directed at the broad economy so much as at trying to ease gridlock in credit markets the fed said it would accept everything from homeequity loans to municipal bonds as collateral for discountwindow loans up to  daysthe decision to keep the benchmark overnight lending rate unchanged  for now  may be a sign that the central bank is still wary of bailing out bad bets by financial institutions and investors st louis fed president william poole said in an interview on aug  that only a calamity would justify a rate cut between scheduled fomc meetingsthey knew what they were doing by maintaining the antiinflation bias at their aug  meeting said former dallas fed president robert mcteer i do not agree with it but i think they were trying very hard not to have a bernanke put they were hardpressed to keep that out of it it became unrealisticformer fed officials say its difficult for central bankers to judge when they should abandon their economic outlook often arrived at through months of internal debate and calculationbernanke  is an expert in inflationtargeting and has spent much of his career in academia he is familiar with the history of the fed the policy errors and contributed to great depression research with a  paper he coauthoredbernanke earned the moniker helicopter ben after a  speech in which he indicated that if interest rates fell to zero in a weak economy he would drop money from helicopters into the banking system to keep it going this was in reference to the price phenomenon plaguing japan at the time which sparked concerns that slowing inflation in the us could lead to the same situationit is a team that is new to the challenge but it is a pretty smart group said harristhus bernanke and his colleagues have tiptoed in and are trying to strike the right balance between doing nothing and riding to the rescue said gary schlossberg senior economist at wells fargo capital management in san francisco which oversees  billion in assets theyve left the door open to a fullblown easing of monetary policy the results are mixed so far and early returns suggest were not out of the woods yet\n",
