""the governor ran for election saying he wanted to grow the state's economy so he wouldn't have to raise taxes. and he's done just that. we've had this (growth in state spending), but we've also lowered taxes.""house speaker greg curtis, r-sandy, and senate president john valentine, r-orem, also came into their top leadership posts over the same three years that huntsman has been in office.but neither leader, each of whom considers himself a fiscal conservative, is concerned about growth in education spending.because of pressing needs and growth in student numbers, ""it's fine by me if that grows faster than other budgets. but this (study) tells me we have to keep those (noneducation) budgets in check,"" curtis said.valentine said the study shows those who have complained that lawmakers haven't enough for utah's children, how much the republican-controlled legislature has given public schools. valentine said he has asked the legislative fiscal analyst, the legislature's own budgeter, how much of the general fund expenditures -- which admittedly have risen quickly recently -- is going to roads. ""we've also made an historic effort to deal with transportation issues. and if most of the (general fund) growth is because of that,"" he won't be as concerned there, valentine added. however, the study looked at road spending, and concluded it is not really ""one time"" expenditures outside of general government growth because the state will be undertaking major highway construction projects for decades to come.susan kuziak of the utah education association, the main teacher union in utah, said while the uta study shows rapid growth in public education funding -- even outstripping the growth in personal income in utah -- there's more to the tax revenue picture.""it takes $67 million each year just to fund the growth in student numbers,"" she said. ""that's just treading water, keeping us still in last place"" among the states in per-pupil funding.""we're having to spend more money on student testing"" because of the federal government's no child left behind requirements, she said.""yes, there's been substantial growth in education spending. but we need that, and more,"" she added. ""we have a surplus of needs, not a surplus of revenues.""this year, huntsman and legislators have $1.6 billion in new and one-time tax revenues over this year and next year. it is by far a record amount of money for the state..house republicans have already voted in caucus to give $300 million in tax cuts. huntsman wants $100 million in tax cuts. while gop senators have yet to set a tax cut number, democrats are advocating that even more cash be spent on schools.counters hughes: ""this study shows we can't keep up this rate of spending -- more than 14 percent a year? impossible."" e-mail: bbjr@desnews.com",2007-01-19,recession
"3","4MTV-WXF0-TXCN-S1Y2-00000-00.txt","republican leaders are promising a more amicable legislative session, devoid of the rancor between the house and senate that last year threatened tax reform proposals and the budget itself.house speaker greg curtis has become the captain of contrition, telling lobbyists and interested citizens that he shoulders some of the blame.""the last session was a rather contentious session and i accept some of - most of - the responsibility for that,"" curtis told a gathering sponsored by the utah taxpayers association, saying he should have listened more and demanded less.along with new house majority leader david clark, curtis has extended a hand to senate republicans and promised a newfound partnership that he hopes will make it easier to decide how to spend the projected $1.6 billion surplus.many, including gov. jon huntsman jr. and democratic salt lake city rep. jackie biskupski, anticipate a much friendlier session.but that's before lawmakers embark on emotional debates about gay high school clubs, abortion or guns. that's before special interest groups start scrapping for their share of the surplus. that's before legislators' personalities and pride become invested in public policy decisions.when asked what happens when legislators go against the will of the public, senate president john valentine jokingly said: ''you only win by 20 votes.''this not-so-veiled jab at curtis' extremely close re-election victory indicates the early good will may not survive in the pressure-filled capitol.and in fact, the two-year relationship between curtis and valentine, between house and senate leaders, has been filled with contention. highway funding dominated the debate in 2005, and house leaders drove the issue.jim ferrin was a representative at the time and he said members of the house gloated that they ran the legislature.senate leaders didn't want a repeat when the 45-day session began last year.""neither the house nor the senate wanted to be perceived as weak,"" ferrin said.curtis and the house republicans requested a hefty tax cut that would rid the state of the hated sales tax on food. senate republicans then took up an income tax reform plan.neither budged. and as the session wound to a close, many lawmakers who didn't participate in the staring contest became annoyed.the legislature removed nearly half of the sales tax on food, but failed to come up with a tax reform package until months later.draper republican rep. greg hughes said: ""that frustrated a lot of people.""and they let their feelings be known during the leadership elections in november.curtis and valentine kept their spots. but they have new lieutenants.house republicans replaced retiring rep. jeff alexander with clark, who is known for being cordial, while alexander was known for being confrontational.west jordan republican rep. steve mascaro describes the switch as a move for ''a softer, a more compassionate kind of leadership.''senate republicans went the other way, replacing soft-spoken majority leader peter knudson with the more aggressive provo sen. curt bramble. legislators are split on bramble's likely impact on negotiations between the chambers.former rep. david ure, who unsuccessfully ran for a senate seat, said he expects bramble to bring the same cutting tone to negotiations that alexander did in the house.ferrin says bramble ''likes for people to think of him as a bulldog, but i know him to have a lot of puppy dog in him.''bramble dismisses the role personalities play in legislation, calling it ''overrated.'' but he has engaged clark in weekly talks to foster a better relationship.clark said he hopes these conversations will continue as lawmakers start tackling some of the most heated topics, such as how to spend the surplus and an ongoing push to use tax dollars to help pay for a private education.mascaro, the representative from west jordan, only uses the word ''surplus'' when referring to pressing demands for social services and educational programs, but not the budget. his mantra is that utah has ''surplus needs and additional money.'' mascaro wants to spend any additional money on programs instead of tax cuts.if he is at one end of the republican spectrum, hughes is at the other. hughes is demanding a $400 million tax cut and limits on new spending.he believes a rapid rise in state spending creates unstable budgets that will crash in an ***economic downturn**.valentine and clark say this debate over tax cuts versus spending on programs will dominate the early days of the session and impact everything from spending in the classroom to the pay of prison guards.they also anticipate a resurgent push for a tuition tax credit or private school vouchers. public education groups generally oppose voucher legislation because they worry the program will suck funding from state-run schools.proponents of vouchers, led by the lobbyist group parents for choice in education, say vouchers will give parents more options and will force the public school system to become more innovative.voucher bills have continuously failed in the house, but hughes said a new strategy has given him hope. hughes is the chairman of the education committee and a prominent voucher supporter.he said house republicans plan to combine a voucher bill with legislation favored by public schools, making it more difficult for voucher opponents to vote against the plan.legislative attorneys are still drafting the plan.vouchers have the support of most legislative leaders, but republican moderates have banded with democrats to kill the bill in the past. salt lake city democratic rep. jackie biskupski expects the same outcome as in years past.""the public

""we've got a fair number of things in the works.""that's not to say that local boosters didn't step back to reconsider whether such an ambitious agenda still made sense. they did, wimmer said, and then they went back to doing what they were used to doing.""it seems kind of silly not to proceed with those things if you stand to lose people,"" he said.assessing the impact on a largely hispanic work force is not as easily done.some of the familiar faces that had been streaming in and out of the tyson parking lot two miles west of town are gone.hector contreras, positioned behind the cash register at tienda mexicana, the town's lone hispanic business, spoke of displaced workers moving 90 miles southeast to lincoln or omaha and sioux city in the weeks following their termination.school superintendent ted deturk said the impact can be measured in empty apartments.""i know the apartment market in town is saturated with apartments looking to be rented,"" he said.but many of the hispanic families, including felipe magana's, have stayed put.two years ago, magana told the journal star of his relief when tyson ended an unprecedented six-week shutdown at the plant. a year ago, he was having trouble getting a new job at the sprawling tyson plant 60 miles away in dakota city, and was thinking about moving.now he's making the half-hour commute to the hormel pork plant in fremont, his wife has quit her job in sioux city and gone to work at omaha steaks in nearby snyder, and their 12-year-old daughter, claudia, feels settled in again as a west point seventh-grader.school is an anchoring presence in her life. ""just being with my friends and my classes,"" she said in a brief telephone interview.deturk didn't know what impact to expect on school enrollment when tyson pulled the plug.in early efforts to come to grips with that uncertainty, school research determined that 169 of about 760 students had at least one parent working at tyson.a recent update in that research suggests that overall enrollment is down by about 30 students. only 19 are from the meatpacking group.""nineteen you could argue were due to the closing of the tyson plant,"" he said. ""other than that, we feel really good that we didn't lose 100 kids.""why didn't that happen?""i think the group of people who worked at tyson were comfortable in the west point area,"" he said, ""and they didn't want to see themselves pick up and move.""even some of those who left did so only after marking some major events in their children's lives.two senior girls stayed on to graduate with the west point class of 2006 while their parents worked more than 200 miles away at the tyson plant in lexington and commuted home on weekends.knobbe said that same feeling of belonging in west point explains why other former workers at the local tyson plant drive 60 miles to meatpacking jobs in madison and dakota city and back again.""many of these people have lived here their whole lives,"" she said.

""nothing, other than an external shock, will derail the economy this year,"" said eugenio j. alemán, senior economist at wells fargo. ""the economy's in good shape.""  unemployment and inflation fell last year while wages and salaries rose at their quickest pace in five years, according to a series of recent government reports. the reports suggest that troubles in housing and manufacturing, though painful for many people, have not caused the widespread economic damage that many experts had feared.  federal reserve policymakers held short-term interest rates steady yesterday, showing they are content  --  at least for now  --  with the state of the economy. they left their benchmark rate on overnight loans between banks unchanged at 5.25 percent, where it has been since june. but they indicated that they remain ready to raise borrowing costs if strong economic growth fuels a fresh bout of inflation.  president bush hailed the news in a speech extolling the strong ""state of the economy"" on wall street, where he was also mobbed visiting the floor of the new york stock exchange. ""as we begin this new year, america's businesses and entrepreneurs are creating new jobs every day,"" he said. ""workers are making more money; their paychecks are going further. consumers are confident, investors are optimistic.""  the bright picture contrasts with the outlook of last summer, when home sales were plummeting and oil was hitting $77 a barrel. many analysts predicted that consumer spending would stall because of costly gasoline, rising unemployment, and stagnant or falling home prices.  but the economy's buoyancy reflects two little-appreciated facts. first, the economy is less vulnerable to high oil prices than in the past, for several reasons, including improved efficiency.  second, while the housing boom did give the economy a boost, the housing bust has not damaged the rapidly growing service industries, which employ about 80 percent of u.s. workers. and those jobs fuel consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity.  ""this is not your grandfather's economy,"" said richard yamarone, director of economic research at argus research. ""this is not a smokestack economy. . . . the consumer is the ultimate driver of the economy.""  economic growth did slow sharply in the spring and summer from a torrid 5.6 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year to a 2.6 percent pace in the second quarter and then 2 percent in the third quarter.  much of the decline was accounted for by home building, which fell at a 19 percent annual rate in both the third and fourth quarters.   nonetheless, overall economic growth rebounded in the last three months of the year, with gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced in the country, rising at a robust 3.5 percent annual rate.  unemployment drifted lower through the year, to 4.5 percent in december from 4.9 percent a year earlier. the job market remained tight as employers in health, education, finance and other service industries created many more new jobs than were cut by mortgage lenders, home builders and automakers.   and the economy got a lift as oil prices tumbled to about $61 a barrel by the end of 2006  --  about where they had been a year earlier.   drivers paying less at the pump had more to spend on shopping during the holiday season. consumer spending rose at a blistering 4.4 percent annual rate in the last three months of the year, the commerce department said yesterday.  falling oil prices helped shave the nation's import bill at year-end, and strong economic growth overseas boosted demand for u.s. exports. the commerce department estimated that the improvement in trade added 1.6 percentage points to the rate of economic growth in the fourth quarter.  businesses continued to build more offices, factories and other types of nonresidential structures, helping to cushion some of the effect of the housing downturn on construction industries.  and unusually warm weather probably prompted more shopping, hiring and construction than would have occurred in colder conditions, several economists said.   although some of the year-end momentum reflected such temporary factors, analysts said, the tight labor market bodes well for 2007.  the commerce department report ""shows you the ability of the economy to ride out the storm of the housing market,"" said wells fargo's alemán. ""the rest of the economy is so strong."" inflation also cooled slightly last year. consumer prices rose 2.8 percent, a bit less than the 2.9 percent gain recorded the year before, the agency said.  many economists seek a sense of underlying inflation by looking at so-called core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices. core prices rose 2.1 percent in 2006 after rising 2.2 percent in 2005.   the fed noted the improvement but said in a statement that ""inflation risks remain"" because of the possibility that the tight labor market will fan price pressures.  a separate labor department report yesterday showed that wages and salaries rose 3.2 percent last year, the fastest rate in five years.   employers' labor costs  --  including both pay and benefits  --  rose 3.3 percent in 2006, up from the 3.1 percent gain in 2005.  several analysts said the gains should not alarm the fed. ""employers' labor costs remain moderate and do not appear to be generating inflationary pressures,"" said jared bernstein, senior economist at the economic policy institute.  the economy is likely to grow about 2.4 percent this year  --  more slowly than last year but at a moderately good pace  --  according to the average prediction of economists surveyed by blue chip indicators, a monthly publication.  housing is likely to remain a drag on growth. builders are still stuck with bloated inventories of unsold homes. unemployment may rise this spring when builders break ground on far fewer new homes.  but several analysts said that despite these lingering soft spots, the fed appears to have achieved the holy grail of central banking  --  a ""soft landing"" in which it raised interest rates last year just enough to cool price pressures without triggering a ***recession**.  now, the central bank is likely to leave interest rates on hold for a while, said nariman behravesh, chief economist for global insight.

''tech stocks have become the darlings of the s.&amp; p. 500,'' said mike thompson, managing director of global research at thomson financial.  that comes as somewhat of a surprise, given that tech stocks appreciated only 7.7 percent last year, on average, versus the 13.6 percent price gain for the broad s.&amp; p. 500.  but with energy stocks and commodities possibly losing steam, investors are searching for the next investment group that may catch fire. and right now, the consensus seems to have settled on technology -- the one sector that hasn't experienced a sustained rally since the bear market of 2000.  it's noteworthy that investors aren't simply betting that tech stock prices will rise more than the broader market. rather, they are counting on tech company earnings to swell.  in fact, ''if tech earnings don't come in as forecast, then we're going to have some real problems,'' mr. thompson said.  that's because, relatively speaking, investor expectations are as high for this sector as they have been in several years.   wall street analysts predict that tech profits will grow 17 percent in 2007, according to thomson financial. by contrast, earnings among all companies in the s.&amp; p. 500 are expected to jump by a much more modest 7.9 percent, on average. and if you strip out tech's expected contributions to the broad market, overall corporate profits are expected to improve by 6.8 percent this year. that's a far cry from the double-digit growth enjoyed by s.&amp; p. 500 companies for the past 13 quarters.  ''it's really the first time since the bubble burst seven years ago that tech earnings are expected to be such a major contributor to the broad market's earnings,'' said jeffrey n. kleintop, chief investment strategist at pnc wealth management in philadelphia.  but therein lies a potential problem. although tech earnings are expected to improve, market strategists say that there is a distinct possibility that these companies won't quite reach the high bar that wall street has set.   there are plenty of reasons to be bullish on the sector: the introduction of microsoft's new vista operating system, for instance, is expected to set off a new round of corporate and consumer technology spending later this year and in 2008. but total technology revenues are expected to increase by only about 14 percent in 2007, according to analysts at morgan stanley. that would be a slower rate of revenue growth than in 2005 and 2006.   moreover, michael f. sola, portfolio manager of the t. rowe price science &amp; technology fund in baltimore, points out that profit margins at many tech companies are already at or near their pre-bubble peaks. and if profit margins don't continue to improve and if revenues don't exceed expectations, it will be hard for many tech companies to meet and exceed their profit targets.  mr. sola says he is concerned that earnings expectations are already making it difficult for tech to surprise on the upside. ''typically, you get significant runs in sectors when earnings estimates start off too low and sentiment is poor,'' he said. right now, however, the opposite is true.  for his part, mr. kleintop predicts that earnings for the tech sector will grow at a much more modest pace -- around 9 to 10 percent -- this year. as a result, he said, overall s.&amp; p. 500 earnings may grow by only around 3 percent.  how will you know who's right -- mr. kleintop or the wall street consensus? pay attention to these trends:is i.t. spending climbing? despite the start of microsoft vista and other product upgrades, sales for information technology, including services and enterprise software, are expected grow at a slower pace than in 2005. many people believe that companies will probably wait until the latter half of this year or until 2008 to bolster spending on technology upgrades. but if companies do accelerate investments in the first half of 2007, it could be good news for tech earnings and for overall corporate profits.is the economy slowing but growing? robert e. turner, chairman and chief investment officer of turner investment partners in berwyn, pa., said that most companies ''have moved beyond the shock of the bubble and have the money to spend on i.t.'' but this assumption depends on a slowing-but-growing economy. should talk of a possible ***recession** creep back onto wall street, he said, all bets are off.are tech companies hitting targets? ''in the first week of this year, there was a notion that this was the year for large-cap tech stocks,'' said john f. jostrand, portfolio manager of the william blair growth fund in chicago. but then, a group of tech companies -- including intel, apple, motorola and symantec -- reported disappointing earnings news, which has tech investors somewhat concerned. that was followed, however, by better-than-expected reports from yahoo and sun microsystems, so the trend remains unclear.  mr. jostrand points out that tech investing today is nothing like it was in the late 1990s. back then, wall street was more than willing to bet on tech's potential. today, investors actually want their tech companies to show them the money -- as in actual realized profit growth.   and if they don't deliver, investors will be more than willing to walk away from the sector -- again.""

"8","4NNF-WVM0-TW8F-G33G-00000-00.txt","c(""daniel gross writes the ''moneybox'' column for slate.com."", ""for the last several decades, the united states has functioned as the main engine of growth in a global economy that has been moving with synchronicity.  ''we're going through the longest stretch of concerted growth in decades,'' said lakshman achuthan, managing director at the economic cycle research institute in new york.so you might think that a sharp slowdown in growth in the united states -- the domestic economy grew at a measly 1.3 percent annual clip in the first quarter this year, less than half the 2006 rate -- would mean trouble for the rest of the global economy. right?  wrong.  as the domestic growth rate has declined sharply in recent quarters, the rest of the world is growing rapidly. india is blowing the door off its hinges. china's economy is expanding at a double-digit pace.  in the united states, the federal reserve has held rates steady since last june, and its next move will most likely be a rate reduction to stimulate growth. the european central bank and the bank of japan, meanwhile, have been raising rates -- lest their once-suffering economies overheat and spawn inflation.  ''the u.s. slump in the first quarter didn't pull down growth in europe or asia,'' said brad setser, senior economist at roubini global economics.    the seemingly countervailing trends -- deceleration in america, full speed ahead abroad -- have led some economists to wonder whether the united states and the rest of the global economy are going their separate ways. some even suggest -- shudder -- that changes in the global economy have made the united states a less-central player.  ''four or five years ago, there was an important switch in the global economy,'' said stephen king, an economist based in london for hsbc. ''since then, other parts of the world have really grabbed the growth baton from the u.s.''   until relatively recently, when the united states sneezed, the world caught a nasty cold. today, mr. king says, the united states has sneezed, but the world has gone shopping.   mr. king notes that emerging markets like china, india, central and eastern europe and the middle east are injecting life into the european and japanese economies through their enormous purchases of capital goods -- all those construction cranes in dubai, bullet trains in china, oil rigs in russia. ''emerging markets' share of global capital spending has risen from 20 percent in the late 1990s to about 37 percent today,'' he said.  western europe is benefiting from rising trade with eastern europe, russia, asia and the middle east. as a result, the euro zone, america's largest trading partner, is simply not as reliant on the united states as it used to be, mr. setser said. ''europe is clearly no longer growing on the back of u.s. domestic demand growth,'' he said. as other economies increasingly trade with one another, the united states plays a diminished role.  but the consensus for decoupling is hardly complete. the united states is still setting the pace, mr. achuthan said: ''we led the world up, and the rest of the world revved up after us. and areas like europe in particular will be slowing in the wake of our slowdown last year.''   the cars of the global economic train are still tethered tightly together, in his view. ''it's less of a decoupling'' he said, ''and more like the jerking you get in a train when the first car stops, and then the other ones stop after a bit of a lag.''    david rosenberg, an economist at merrill lynch, said he believes that the apparent divergence in the world's big economies has more to do with the nature of the growth slowdown in the united states, which has stemmed not from a decline in consumption, but from a decline in investment -- specifically in housing.  ''almost 100 percent of the u.s. slowdown has been due to the housing industry,'' mr. rosenberg said. and housing is an intensely local and national industry -- from the real estate broker to the mortgage lender, from home depot to interior decorators. ''unless you run a sawmill in canada, international trade isn't directly affected by the decline in u.s. housing,'' mr. rosenberg said.  martin n. baily, a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in washington, says he thinks that it's a good thing for the united states if it's no longer the leader. ''we have a huge imbalance in our trade, and we need to be a little less of an engine of growth for the rest of the world, and let europe and japan, and hopefully china, eventually, pick up the slack,'' he said. ''and right now it seems like they're doing so.''  but mr. baily added that we shouldn't be so quick to believe that the world economy is significantly more independent of the united states than it was in the past. ''i don't think there's been a complete decoupling,'' he said. ''a u.s. ***recession** would dramatically slow growth in china and india.''  the real test of the decoupling thesis, mr. rosenberg said, will come if consumer spending starts slowing down. consumer spending in the united states, which is still on the rise, accounts for an astonishing 20 percent of the global economy, he said. ''i find it hard to believe,'' he said, ''that the rest of the world is going to be immune to a consumer sector that's primarily responsible for pulling in nearly $2 trillion of the world's output.''   consumer spending hasn't fallen for a single quarter since the fourth quarter of 1991. and while there are factors affecting domestic consumer spending -- higher interest rates, lower housing prices, higher gas prices -- the indefatigable american spenders show few signs of letting up.   ''before we can say there's a decoupling, we have to wait for a sneeze,'' mr. rosenberg said. ''all we've had is a runny  nose.''  ""

"9","4NRS-T910-TW8F-G34X-00000-00.txt","as the big broadcast networks complete a week of previews for madison avenue of their schedules for the coming season, the same words are on everyone's lips: not the title of an appealing new series or the name of a promising young star, but the phrase ''live plus three.''  the words refer to a different way of measuring television viewership in homes with tivos and other digital video recorders. dvrs, along with ipods, video-on-demand and pcs with broadband connections, are remaking how people watch television -- and commercials.revising the traditional system of measuring tv ratings, which counts only live viewership of programs, is gaining urgency because an estimated 17 percent of american households now own dvrs. in some large cities, dvr penetration exceeds 25 percent.   at stake are billions of dollars of commercial time that advertisers will buy from the networks for the 2007-8 season after negotiations in the upfront market, so called because the talks take place before the season starts.  several popular series like ''grey's anatomy'' on abc, ''the office'' on nbc and ''24'' on fox are increasingly being watched as recordings, rather than live. if the delayed viewing of those shows by dvr users is not taken into account, those viewers are ''lost'' to the broadcasters -- meaning the networks cannot charge advertisers as much for commercials.nielsen media research, the ratings arbiter, measures viewership through methods ranging from live through live plus seven days, counting playback within a week of recording. under the standard of live plus three, the broadcasters and advertisers are agreeing to count viewers who watch a show live or within 72 hours of its original appearance.  recently, the networks wanted to adopt the live-plus-seven standard. the advertisers wanted the live standard because, they contended, many commercials have limited shelf lives -- like spots that promote a movie opening on a certain weekend or a sale that lasts just 24 hours.  the compromise on live plus three was discussed yesterday by executives of cbs at a news conference to introduce their prime-time schedule for 2007-8. executives at abc, who presented their schedule on tuesday, also said they believed that live plus three would become the common currency for upfront negotiations.  ''live plus three, a lot of clients and agencies have accepted that,'' said jo ann ross, president for sales at cbs, after a series of meetings over the last several weeks.  last spring, in the upfront market before the 2006-7 season, cbs and the other broadcasters tried to persuade the agencies and advertisers to accept live plus seven. they ultimately failed, meaning the live standard was in place for another season.  ''this is still a gentleman's business,'' ms. ross said. ''you do business on gentleman's agreements.''  if some advertisers want to use measurements other than live plus three, ms. ross said, cbs ''is going to be flexible'' and consider just about any alternative -- except one.  ''we want to write business,'' ms. ross said, but ''we will not do live only; we want to get credit for dvr viewing.''  the difference in attitude between last year and this year seems attributable to data showing the growing popularity of dvrs. david f. poltrack, chief research officer at cbs, said his forecasts estimated that by the fourth quarter, dvr penetration would increase nationally to 20 percent or 21 percent. and by spring 2008, he added, it ''will be in the high 20s.''   ''the good news,'' mr. poltrack said, is that about three-quarters of all shows watched in delayed mode in dvr homes originally appeared on broadcast networks, which include cw in addition to abc, cbs, nbc and fox. in dvr homes, he added, series like ''c.s.i.'' on cbs are watched even more as playbacks than they are live.  in the broadcast upfront market last spring, advertisers agreed to purchase an estimated $9 billion worth of commercials in prime-time shows. cbs sold an estimated $2.4 billion, second behind abc, which sold more than $3 billion.  like the other broadcasters, cbs is joining a trend toward series with fantasy or science-fiction themes by adding ''moonlight,'' about a private investigator who is a vampire and in love with a mortal woman.   there is a widespread belief that the 2007-8 upfront market will proceed more slowly than usual because of the change to live plus three as a ratings standard. another factor that may slow the discussions is the coming shift by nielsen to reporting ratings by commercial viewership rather than program viewership.  typically, a slow upfront market means demand is weaker than supply. that usually happens in an ***economic downturn** or ***recession**. wall street usually interprets a fast-paced upfront market as bullish for the networks -- and the economy.  the cbs executives said they hoped that everyone involved in the negotiations -- not to mention observers like reporters -- would see a slower market as a sign that the advertisers and agencies were working through the changes rather than as reluctance to buy commercial time.  ''we want the advertisers to be comfortable,'' mr. poltrack said. ''this year, slow and steady may win the race.''  the upfront market also may be slowed by broadcasters' plans to change how they arrange commercials. ratings based on commercials, rather than programs, mean that the networks benefit if viewers stick around during commercial breaks rather than change channels.  for instance, the hispanic network telemundo announced at its upfront presentation on tuesday that it would limit the length of the initial commercial pod, or break, in each prime-time show.  the initiative is being called the power pod, said steve mandala, senior vice president for sales, marketing and distribution at telemundo, part of the nbc universal division of the general electric company.  ''starting in the fall, the first commercial break in every prime-time show will be just 60 seconds,'' mr. mandala said.   by comparison, a typical initial pod on a broadcast network show can run two to three minutes. on the principal rival to telemundo, univision, the first break is two and a half minutes long.  a consortium of private equity firms has bought the parent of univision, univision communications, but the network continued its tradition of playing host to the glitziest and most star-filled upfront presentation.  the univision extravaganza yesterday in the time warner center featured jennifer lopez, the creator and executive producer of a five-part mini-series that is to appear during 2007-8. there were also performances by her husband, marc anthony, and the members of the pop band rbd, who will be the subjects of their second univision series.  the upfront week began on monday with nbc and will conclude today with cw and fox.

""everything seemed to be going well and then six months into 2006, we already saw the warning signs.""at the end of last year, visini said, 9.6 percent of all outstanding mortgage loans in san diego county were subprime and of those, 11.3 percent of owners were at least 60 days late in making payments.the dataquick figures, assembled by zip code, show high concentrations of distressed properties in newly built south county communities such as otay ranch and among condo conversion complexes countywide. in both cases, buyers stretched their finances to purchase a home and then saw values fall, making it impossible for them refinance into more affordable loans.the area with the highest local default rate this year was san ysidro zip code 92173, with a rate of 10.79 per 1,000 homes. default activity for january and february ranked san ysidro 15th among 1,100 zip codes statewide having 1,000 or more homes.from there, the local zip codes with the most default notices dropped to 49th and lower in the statewide survey.also in south county, three chula vista zip codes were among the 10 worst-performing san diego-area communities. rancho san diego was the 10th-worst performer, ranking 168th statewide.san diego's housing prices went up so fast this decade that many market watchers expect them to continue dropping as they did last year. if that occurs, owners of distressed properties may have to sell at a loss if they want to avoid foreclosure, real estate agents say.florida-based housing predictor, an online real estate data company, ranked san diego this week as the nation's second-worst housing market, behind los angeles. the company said san diego was likely to see a 13 percent drop in average home prices this year.""what we foresee is the market in san diego bottoming out toward the end of this year and the future flattening,"" said housing predictor editor mike colpitts.edward leamer, director of the ucla anderson forecast, agreed, saying the california housing market is likely to resemble an ""l,"" as prices and sales drop and then remain low for the foreseeable future.but in his update on the state's economy due monday, leamer said he will predict a relatively stable economy without the job losses and other reverses that devastated california 15 years ago and triggered the last real estate downturn.""we think the problems in real estate will stay in real estate and not affect the rest of the economy,"" he said. the forecast's accuracy in predicting the path of real estate suffered a blow in 2005 when some of its economists warned of an impending correction in the housing market and a possible ***recession** that never materialized.rick sharga, vice president of marketing for realtytrac, which like dataquick also follows defaults and foreclosures, said bargain-basement prices have yet to show up in san diego neighborhoods.""the real bargains are out of state,"" he said.the dataquick data showed that zip codes in chula vista east of interstate 805, where much building has occurred in eastlake and otay ranch, ranked among the neighborhoods with the most default activity.for example, the 91913 zip code that incorporates much of eastlake and otay ranch had 37 foreclosures, compared with only two a year ago, and 90 default notices, compared with 29 a year ago.javier garcia of virtual realty &amp;

""the 'rising tide lifts all boats' has always been a problem. if you think about that analogy, the rising tide is a very good idea if you have a boat. but if you are too poor to afford a boat and you are standing tiptoe in water, the rising tide goes up your nose. and so that's a mistake.""house speaker nancy pelosi of california wants the house to approve legislation this week boosting the federal minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour. supporters say the move will help the working poor. critics say it could force companies to cut jobs.in general, the federal reserve and private economists say the country's job climate is good - especially given the troubled housing and automotive sectors.for all of 2006, the unemployment rate averaged 4.6 percent, a six-year low. it was a considerable improvement from 2003's 6 percent rate, the highest under bush.""that says a lot,"" gutierrez said of last year's showing.

(if i took the queens-midtown tunnel to get across the east river, it would cost me $4.50. being cheap, i don't.)once in manhattan, i try to find street parking, but most often fail. so i pay a stupendous fee -- never less than $20 -- to a parking garage. i suppose the firm that runs the garage pays taxes to the city; but other than my indirect share of those taxes, i get my slice of the big apple for free. it's not fair.would i still drive in to manhattan if there was an $8 entry fee? probably not. that's the point of pricing, though. you can pay to get your amenity, or not pay and not get it. liberty!still they grumble, even on the political right. here is a heritage foundation writer on foxnews.com:the mayor calls it a ""congestion fee."" in fact, it's a tax and a penalty for using a motor vehicle. the revenue would go to mass transit, not to roads and bridges.it's not the fees themselves that vex this writer, but the fact that mayor bloomberg wants to spend the revenues on improving mass transit, rather than the roads and bridges that the fee-payers are actually using. the writer has a point. just as it's generally a good thing for people to pay what a public amenity costs, it's a good thing for their payments to be spent on maintaining and improving that amenity, rather than boosting the subsidy to a different amenity that -- see above -- is already over-subsidized.traffic control in general is, i often reflect when driving around, one of the more ill-thought-out aspects of public policy. it has long been known, for example, that all-way stops are less of a hindrance to traffic flow than traffic lights, and in most cases just as safe. i would guess that at least half the traffic lights in my town could be thus replaced. it doesn't happen, though.replacing stop signs by yield signs can also improve traffic flow without, in many locations, any safety downside, but that is hardly ever done either. in fact there are so few yield signs in my neck of the woods that drivers seem not to understand them. this is especially apparent at my town's one traffic circle. the place is festooned with yield signs, but it's a happy day when anyone yields to anyone. (traffic circles are also great improvers of traffic flow, but are hardly ever seen in the u.s.a. -- except, for some reason, in massachusetts.)not only are traffic lights often an expensive superfluity, there seems to be a conspiracy to make them as annoying as possible. in my state you are permitted to make a right turn at red lights (except in new york city), after coming to a stop, of course. this law was apparently passed in order to generate employment for people who make and install signs saying no turn on red, it now being a rare traffic-lighted intersection that does not have such a sign.annoyances of that kind are of course trivial by comparison with the greatest annoyance of all: the jammed expressway. around here we refer bitterly to our major regional artery as ""the long island parking lot."" i have wasted untold hours of my life sitting fuming on the l.i.e. yet i see from u.s. news &amp; world report that my county ranks only 31 in their table of ""the worst counties"" for commuting. i suppose that is because we are far enough out from the great wen that most of our automobile commuting is to neighboring suburbs. that, though, is another problem, as major-road systems were originally designed with city-to-suburb travel in mind, not suburb-to-suburb.at least there are technological fixes available. sensor technology, computer-processing power, and the sophistication of algorithms are now up to the task of real-time traffic control, as los angeles has proved with its automated traffic surveillance and control system. ""los angeles drivers spend less time in traffic now than they did a decade ago,"" the usn&amp;w report tells us.those processors and algorithms still have to work with existing roads, though. they also have to cope with 150,000 extra people adding themselves to the city every year, a number not totally unrelated to irrational immigration policies and lax immigration enforcement. in l.a., as in long island, we shall be singing along with james taylor for a few years yet:damn! this traffic jam. how i hate to be late. it hurts my motor to go so slow. damn! this traffic jam. time i get home my supper'll be cold. damn! this traffic jam...

""when someone has to go to the emergency room because they don't have health care, everybody ends up paying that cost. when a family loses housing and goes to a shelter, it costs more to serve them that it would have cost to assist them and prevent them from becoming homeless in the first place.""children raised in poverty have lower educational achievement, greater health problems, and poor future prospects for work and income, wsu vancouver's mcreynolds said.  support networka network of government and nonprofit agencies attempts to help people in dire straights by providing food, housing and mental health services, said mike piper, director of clark county community services.""we are shocked by the volume of people we're seeing seeking help,"" piper said.

poor's, said most of the sluggishness nationally will be felt in the housing industry and associated businesses.housing starts will be down about 1.5 million from last year and home prices will drop about 7 percent across the country, he said. \""we're looking for economic growth of 2.3 percent, with most of the damage from the housing market. but the rest of the economy is chugging along,\"" mr. wyss said.a drop in oil and gasoline prices, as has occurred early this year, are key to a better 2007, he said.auto sales will be about 16.3 million, down from 16.5 million last year. \""it's a drop, but still not a bad year,\"" the economist said.car and truck sales are important to the local economy not only for the car dealerships and the banks that lend money, but also to the manufacturers, and toledo has four big three automaker factories, plus dozens of suppliers.bob jorgensen, president of kistler ford inc. in sylvania township, said car and truck sales locally should increase this year, in part because gasoline prices have dropped.\""we even renovated our dealership for about a half million dollars last year,\"" he said. \""i wouldn't have done that if i didn't feel there would be a return on investment.\""a hiccup in the auto industry, however, often brings layoffs, at least temporary ones, to metro toledo.predictions for hiringhiring at the outset of the year is expected to be reasonable, with one of every three firms adding jobs, according to a survey by manpower inc., a temporary staffing agency. that's higher than 23 percent nationally. but 23 percent locally forecast job cuts, compared with 11 percent nationally.\""overall employment should continue at a slow growth pace  ...  which is what most of the statistics would point to,\"" said keith ewald, labor market analyst for ohio's department of jobs and family services.but northwest ohio is in better shape than other areas of the state, he said. others have been hit hard by job cuts by ford motor co. and general motors corp., he said. but ford is closing its maumee stamping plant and eliminating the 700 jobs there next year, and daimlerchrysler ag is converting its machining factory in perrysburg township into an engine parts factory this year, chopping 800 jobs.high expectationsmike fischer, owner of fischer tool &amp; die co. in temperance, expects 2007 to be better than 2006. \""other people i've talked to, for the most part, i think they're all expecting just a decent year,\"" he said. \""the ones associated with ford, they don't expect even that.\""his contracts with chrysler, honda motor co., and nissan motor co. improved sales by over $10 million in 2006, enabling him to add 30 jobs.\""we're in the process to select a site this year for another facility in tennessee to serve the u.s. auto market,\"" he said.modest manufacturing losses could be offset in northwest ohio by growth in professional services, education, and hospitality and leisure sectors, mr. ewald said.steve weathers, president of the regional growth partnership in toledo, said 2007 will be a good year locally. the area's 51,000 manufacturing jobs will decrease, but positions will be added to the 10,000 professional and scientific jobs, he said.\""it won't be all good news, but slowly the region is making a transition to a more knowledge-based economy, and that should lead to new business start-ups,\"" he said.difficulties in housing remain troublesome. housing starts lo-cally are down, and property foreclosures are up 43 percent in metro toledo from 2005, according to realtytrac inc.the toledo board of realtors said housing sales in the region were 8,243 last year, with year-end average prices of $121,000, down from 8,618 and $126,000 the year before.the housing slump has mostly hurt new-home builders and those who buy existing homes to fix up and sell, said dave browning, president of welles bowen realty co.bulging homes-for-sale inventories began to appear in 2005 and continued last year. \""i think by this july we'll look back at first half of '07 and say it too didn't compare very well to last year,\"" mr. browning said.still, he noted, 2003, 2004, and 2005 were among the best sales-wise ever locally.mr. wyss, the economist, also cited positives that should keep the country out of ***recession**. the trade deficit is declining, inflation is in check, interest rates aren't too high, unemployment is manageable, and capital spending is up.\""in the '70s and '80s, we would have thought this was going to be a pretty good year,\"" he said.mr. jorgensen, the kistler car dealer, perhaps summed up what many experts think for this year: \""people are moving on, getting new jobs, moving on with their lives.\""contact jon chavez at:jchavez@theblade.com or 419-724-6128.copyright (c) 2007, the blade, toledo, ohio distributed by mcclatchy-tribune business news. for reprints, email tmsreprints@permissionsgroup.com, call 800-374-7985 or 847-635-6550, send a fax to 847-635-6968, or write to the permissions group inc., 1247 milwaukee ave., suite 303, glenview, il 60025, usa."",

"20","4N61-W240-TW8F-G269-00000-00.txt","the young couple are seated together awaiting another real estate agent's appraisal in what is called the ''english pub room'' of their 1730 antique home in westport. theirs is the kind of property that ads typically limn as ''historic charmer with state-of-the-art amenities.'' this means the imposing stone hearth is hung with a tasteful dark plasma screen instead of a fox-hunting print.  the couple took two years to renovate, expand and hone the place to architectural digest perfection while they lived elsewhere. the home's craftsmanship and detail are exquisite, from the outdoor fireplace to the fully wired and wi-fied his-and-hers offices much desired by fairfield county's blackberry-dependent financial services cadres.''those offices are absolutely going to sell this house,'' says michelle genovesi, a westport broker with a 100-gigabyte memory for detail, detail, detail, and a sales presentation that corners and shifts as smoothly as the bmw she drove up in. ''commuters are willing to spend more for things like this if it means they can work at home one or two days a week.''  ms. genovesi, a former wilhelmina model, is the founder and top producer of her westport-area firm, michelle &amp; company. despite the housing ***market slowdown**, her three-agent team did $70 million in sales volume in 2006.  teams are a trend in the region's residential real estate market. sharing resources, from office workers to webmasters, has become practical as agents struggle to keep up with local and internet listings. according to the national association of realtors, web listings are now consulted by 80 percent of americans looking to buy homes.   successful teams like ms. genovesi's are actively courted by big national agencies, which are only too happy to encourage their local, personalized approach. ms. genovesi says she has had many corporate suitors but has opted to stay with a parent company, william raveis real estate and home services, because its founder and chief executive, william raveis, ''allows you to unleash your personality in the business.''  ''he's not fearful of you growing and branding yourself,'' she says.   mr. raveis said: ''michelle is a mega-agent. we're in negotiations for her to double that sales volume, expand her territory and her team.''  to that end, ms. genovesi is shopping for her own office building, where she will add to her current team -- two ''buyer specialist'' agents and a six-person staff that provides administrative, web, mortgage and marketing support.  ''most people in our industry are reactive to the market,'' mr. raveis said. ''she's very proactive. she branded herself and created this team approach before anyone else out here thought of it. now there are lots of michelle wannabes.''  among the more visible branded teams in the region are mike luchen's in westchester, whose ads promise, ''team mike luchen realtors speak english, italian, spanish, polish and german.'' there are married teams and sister acts, like the twin team in westchester, identical sisters whose web site trumpets ''a shared synergy.''   in essex county, n.j., the baldwin dream team, a remax quartet of former freelance writers and administrators, will be one of three teams featured on a new reality series, ''bought and sold,'' on hgtv in late april. roberta baldwin, lead agent of the team, which did $40 million in sales in 2006, explained why she set up her own shop within the remax penumbra: ''i wanted to be more entrepreneurial, and i found people to help me grow my business that i can absolutely trust to have our interests at heart. it's pretty cutthroat in real estate, either on your own or in a big company. clients also like the idea that they'll be taken care of even when i'm busy elsewhere.''   mr. raveis, whose business has 55 offices in connecticut and massachusetts with 1,700 agents and claims $5 billion in annual sales, has big producers besides ms. genovesi. most notable is jean ruggiero, who, embedded in greenwich -- a hedge-fund capital -- can bring in $110 million in yearly volume by selling executive castles.   the rich do shop differently, mr. raveis said, and he especially values ms. genovesi for her ability to reel in and placate corporate titans and their families -- and their decorators. ''to deal with the high-end seller and high-end demands and be sane  well, she's amazing,'' he said.  selling white-glove service requires a statelier pace, and no visible pressure. ms. genovesi's presentation to the couple with the westport property takes more than an hour and includes a customized, meticulously researched portfolio on their home and others in the area, prepared by her staff. she is the third agent the couple have interviewed.  as the spring real estate market gets off to a brisk start -- ms. genovesi says you can peg it, reliable as the first robin, to the first weekend after the super bowl -- they want to be ready.  the last agent the couple interviewed left a brochure and dashed off after a few words about installing a lockbox.   ''under no circumstances do we do a lockbox here,'' ms. genovesi says. ''you do not walk in and out of an exceptional property at will.'' she will show the home herself, and only to those prequalified with a discreet questionnaire and mortgage preapproval.   ''if buyers decide after a tour it's not right, i'll introduce them to my buyer team members, who will share with them whatever else is in the market,'' '' ms. genovesi says. ''that's where i pass the baton. my focus is on selling my properties.''  she says she will sell the home three times: to other agents, to a buyer and to the bank appraiser. she will invite other agents in for a look and a catered lunch, but there will be no open house. ''too many people just want to check out the granite counters and get some ideas,'' she says.  calling ms. genovesi, the wife says, was ''almost automatic,'' given her reputation and visibility. according to a competing agent, ''no one would think of listing a high-end property without having michelle at least do an appraisal.''  for her part, ms. genovesi does not want to know the competition. ''i have 23 years' experience here,'' she says, ''and i can say that i own the high-end market.''   as conversation deepens, ms. genovesi's pronouns subtly slide from ''your'' to ''our,'' as in ''our appliances and renovations are mint.'' finally, the sensitive part -- the number -- comes up. ms. genovesi routinely turns down listings if the asking prices are unrealistically high. sometimes sellers come back to her -- and her number -- after other agents fail to move the house. ''the number is just a suggestion based on my experience and market education,'' she says. it can be fine-tuned. she tells the couple her number and commission. they nod.   one more big question hangs: are things moving? ''there's lots of inventory now,'' ms. genovesi says, ''but in some segments, only 50 percent sold last year, in others only 25 percent. statistically, the high end hasn't taken as big a hit as the rest of the market -- especially with this year's wall street bonuses. we're definitely feeling those bonuses now. we find that when the market turns, it's the lower and higher ends that still do well. it's the middle market that suffers the most.''  as part of her presentation, she explains her career path: ''in the late '80s, no one was really taking any part of the business and owning it. so i decided to focus on listing and marketing exceptional properties. to do that i needed to brand myself. i started to spend money to make money. i put my photograph in my ads. back then, everyone said, 'what's with the picture?' but people remembered. i started getting calls.''  ms. genovesi does business in expensive but understated clothes and in two bmws: a 5 series s.u.v. for ferrying clients, and a sportier 3 series convertible she just bought as a 50th birthday present to herself. she had considered indulging in a maserati but rejected it as ''too pretentious.''   nothing, not even a well-earned midlife toy, should interfere with the image she has honed carefully, some might say obsessively, since she arrived in connecticut as a fiancee looking for a house and got her real estate license ''on a whim.'' after two long engagements, she is ''single and fine with it.''  as the eldest of five children born into an air force family, ''i'm a habitual caregiver,'' she says. a mobile childhood, much of it in europe -- five moves during the last two years of high school -- made her an extrovert of necessity. her brief modeling career was fun, chiefly for the travel, but she found fashion confining.   by taking the long view in her next endeavor, she says, she has carved herself a posh, scalamandre-upholstered niche here on connecticut's gold coast. ''exceptional properties'' translates to $2 million to $15 million. most of ms. genovesi's listings have names, like pier way, lord's manor and the hermitage. they will appear on premiere web sites with detailed virtual tours. qualified buyers will get custom portfolios including a cd-rom virtual tour of the property, its photo imprinted on the disc.   some homes, like judith paixao's riverside compound, a property once owned by the prima ballerina tanaquil le clercq, have exceptional provenance. ms. le clercq and her husband, the choreographer george balanchine, also owned a summer residence across the road. ''it's a singular property that needs the right buyer,'' ms. paixao said. ''i needed someone who could think way outside the box, and that was michelle. she gets it. she arranged to have two chico's holiday catalogs photographed there -- and showed the place right in the middle of the shoot.''  ms. genovesi has other ideas for the 1730 antique property. ''weather permitting, i can have an aerial photographer here by the weekend,'' she tells the couple. from the air, the manicured grounds will show to estate-like advantage. ''people are starting to look now,'' she tells the owners. ''our biggest binding month, when offers are written, is march.'' the couple have one more agent to see; they promise a prompt decision and see her out warmly.  ''i'm sure i've got it,'' ms. genovesi says as she heads to her car.   even perfect properties require an alternative mind-set. on another day, ms. genovesi demonstrates her house-showing technique at a modernist masterwork in saugatuck shores -- waterfront, private dock, $8.8 million. this is not a home to perfume with the smell of baking cookies. but the automatic shades will be raised to the view when buyers stroll in. cool jazz -- appropriate to the modern art, the custom leather floors in the library -- will provide a chic soundtrack. ''we're not selling a house,'' ms. genovesi instructs. ''we're selling a lifestyle.''   this is how she was able to price the home next door to this one at an audacious $9 million -- almost $2 million over what she said the westport market was bearing at the time.  ''in exceptional properties you have to market outside the town you're in,'' ms. genovesi says. she researched waterfront prices all the way to greenwich and sent e-mail messages to more than 500 potential customers. a darien agent saw it and brought her clients, who had been looking at waterfront in greenwich, where the prices are higher. they bought it for the asking price.  thus, in so many ways, ms. genovesi is not what mr. raveis calls a ''maintenance'' realtor -- that diligent professional who tucks so many suburban families into center-hall colonials. nor does she fit the voracious, blonde-in-a-gold-lexus cliche of the go-go '90s. at the weekly team meeting at michelle &amp; company, six women come and go, talking of corporate ''relo.'' mobility is the agent's bread and butter: corporate relocations, divorce, remarriages with blended families, empty nesters.   audrey demetres, one of the two agents who concentrate on buyers, says this is an especially fluid market. ''i came from a house where my teenage wallpaper is still on the wall,'' ms. demetres says. ''but i don't think i've ever sold anyone a house that was thinking in terms of a lifetime home. they'll either upsize, downsize. they never think of staying in that 30-year-mortgage house. i have one family that couldn't move up fast enough -- a two-bedroom cottage, then a colonial, then new construction, all before they were 34.''  ms. demetres's counterpart, suzanne dodge, left a high-profile career in real estate marketing in manhattan after she had her third child, but she wanted ''a serious career'' in the suburbs. the high-tech embrace of ms. genovesi's team was perfect. ''internet was just cranking up,'' ms. dodge says. ''that was a huge expense to take on as a sole agent. i was advertising, trying to get listings, staying up all night answering e-mails, writing ads.''  signing on with ms. genovesi after a stint at another agency, ''i was just dazzled,'' ms. dodge says. ''everything is smooth. i never do paperwork after i sell a house. they handle everything. and i can go out and sell another house.''  a few days after ms. genovesi's presentation to the couple with the 1730 home, she is sitting in a westport starbucks. above the cellphone cacophony of other recaffeinating brokers, she confides, ''i got the listing.'' the aerial shots are done, the number is firmed up, the virtual tour is being shot. she is talking about the office buildings along the post road that she has been looking at for her expansion when a lawyer, joseph c. maya, strides over and says hello. she is friendly, but quizzical until he explains that she found him a house in 2001 when he wanted to move his family to a quieter, safer street.   ms. genovesi had forgotten mr. maya's first name, but she could summon the precise transaction details.   he is pumping her hand. ''since then i've sent over 20 people to you,'' he says. ''i'll probably send 20 more.''   she thanks him with a big grin. ''bring 'em on,'' she says.",2007-03-04,market slowdown
"21","4N5K-K7J0-TWCX-R2PM-00000-00.txt","stock markets fall around the globe and the dow jones industrial average sinks 416 points in a day. tuesday's stock market tumble, abrupt and steep, was scary.with volatility continuing as of yesterday, we may be entering a phase of intensified unpredictability in stocks.whether this portends a ***recession** or just slower economic growth remains to be seen. in any case, it's a reminder that congress needs to deal with problems in the economy that impede growth, including taxes, regulation, and health care.much of this week's negative economic news was either blown out of proportion or already known. this suggests that the market's tone is skittish because stock prices are high and because no one believes that the business cycle has been repealed.start with monday's headlines that the former federal reserve chairman, alan greenspan, was forecasting a ***recession**. reports exaggerated his nuanced statement: ""while, yes, it is possible that we can get a ***recession** in the latter months of 2007, most forecasters are not making that judgment."" the reports omitted his depiction of the global economy as ""benign and stable.""then comes wednesday's announcement that the fourth-quarter gross domestic product was revised downward to an annual rate of 2.2% from a prior estimate of 3.5%. this was not new information because the decline was caused primarily by a prior downward revision to inventories.the week's housing data were pessimistic and may indicate that the housing sector has not bottomed out yet. housing declined 14% and building permits declined by 2.6%. existing home sales rose, but sales of new homes declined by 17%, which was the largest monthly decline in 13 years.but, as my colleague at the hudson institute, john weicher, observed, ""one month of these data never means anything, especially in the winter. january's decline in new home sales comes after a 9% increase in december."" and the office of federal housing oversight house price index, released yesterday, showed that house prices in the fourth quarter of 2006 were 6% higher than last year's.the most troublesome of the week's data, perhaps presaging a slower economy, came from a 6% decline in new orders and a 3% decline in shipments of core capital goods, defined as nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft. this carefully constructed measure shows that production in the economy is likely to decline.yesterday's rise of 1% of personal incomes in january was a positive sign of growth. but it was accompanied by signs of higher inflation, hence the postponed hopes for a fed rate cut. the increase of manufacturing activity as widely reported yesterday by the institute for supply management's index of manufacturing activity was practically meaningless because it measures future plans of only 400 unweighted firms rather than past economic production.with the rapid growth phase of the economic recovery behind us, our challenge now is how to keep the economy going. a growing economy is essential to americans' well-being, and generates not only higher incomes, but also rising tax revenues - with lower rates - to pay for the war in iraq, food stamps, health care, and spending on medical research.inasmuch as the housing sector has not yet recovered, consumer spending is high relative to levels of income. and while services are gradually taking the place of manufacturing, we need to look to other sectors of the economy to spur growth. some possibilities include nonresidential construction, software, or exports. right now, we don't know which one will produce growth, hence investors' anxiety.this anxiety is exacerbated though by our inability to correctly measure change in our $13 trillion economy. according to bear stearns chief economist david malpass, we underestimate growth because a larger share of investment is being expensed or depreciated. thus, the value of firms' investments isn't accurately observed, and we actually have more capital than is reported.similarly, the bureau of labor statistics has been underestimating jobs that are created in the economy, because it cannot accurately sample firms. last month bls added 754,000 jobs to correct data from april 2005 through march 2006.to keep the economy growing, we need to prevent taxes from rising. tax rate increases are built into law and will rise without new legislation. bills enacted between 2001 and 2003 will expire in 2010;

""the risk now is that all this external assistance will be politicized,"" says a prominent donor in jerusalem.it gets worse. the united states favors fatah over hamas, but its sanctions effort may also backfire in syria, another key hamas ally. a freeze on overseas bank accounts held by suspected syrian extremists is chasing a fortune in syrian cash back to damascus, fueling the fastest economic growth (better than 5 percent) in a decade.

"25","4N8B-P150-TW8F-G38H-00000-00.txt","new delhi, mar. 5 -- asian stock markets continued to fall today as nervous investors shunned the region despite strong economic signals from some asian countries. the trend spread to europe, where stocks also slid in morning trading. but on wall street the damage was limited, and share prices climbed after a brief fall in early trading.  nearly every significant stock market index in asia ended the day lower, and drops were severe in many markets. japan's topix and benchmark nikkei 225 indices fell 3.4 and 3.3 percent. hong kong's hang seng index dropped 4 percent. indian stocks traded at one stage at their lowest level in five months. the bombay stock exchange's sensitive index, or sensex, fell 471.09 points, or 3.7 percent, to 12,415.04. the vietnamese market was almost alone in posting an advance.stocks in europe continued to decline today because of concerns that last week's drop, which wiped out $2.3 trillion from global markets,could steer investors away from equities. in london, the benchmark ftse index fell 1.45 percent to 6027.4 around midday.  in the united states, trading on the new york stock exchange began the day with a drop. the dow jones industrial average fell more than 60 points during the first minutes of trading. by midday, however, the market had more than recovered, with the dow up 12 points to 12,120.26. the broader standard and poor's 500 stock index also had edged up slightly, as did the nasdaq composite.   analysts in europe said that the sell-off of assets considered risky was likely to continue for some days. but they said that the decline was probably not a sign of a new ***recession** and that it was unlikely to set one off.   one fund manager noted that there is still enough liquidity in the market and companies are still reporting higher profits, so the stock slump is not likely to be more than a market correction.   ''this is the way that corrections work,'' said garry evans, a strategist with hsbc in hong kong.   the markets are ''spooked,'' he said. ''a week ago, everyone was very excited about the markets and now no one wants to buy stocks,'' he added.   some were a bit less sanguine: ''there is a genuine fear that the correction will be more than 10 percent globally for the developed markets,'' said michael hughes, chief investment officer at baring asset management in london. ''we had such a good run that there is a sense that money has been made too easily.''   the pan-asian and european declines extended a downward trend that began last tuesday when the shanghai stock market dropped nearly 9 percent. investors in europe said they are closely watching the american bond markets and the performance of safer stocks, such as banks and healthcare, for any signs that the recent market jitters worsen.  many economists and strategists predicted that volatility could increase sharply in asian markets for weeks to come, as investors pull back from speculative investments and redirect assets to more mature markets, and as other investors look for buying opportunities.   this flight from risky assets has become particularly evident in currency markets. the japanese yen has been rising even as other asian currencies decline because many investors are unwinding some of their transactions, called ''carry trades.''   in this trading strategy, hedge funds and other investors have been borrowing yen at low interest rates and then converting into other currencies to buy stocks in markets with higher returns, such as australia, malaysia, indonesia and the philippines. but they are now reversing many of these trades.   the retreat of investors from carry trades is now exacerbating the speed of regional declines, analysts said.  the more the yen rises, the more expensive it becomes for carry traders to pay off their japanese debt, and the faster they try to sell their holdings, the more they feed a vicious cycle of selling as they unwind their positions.   banking stocks have suffered as profit at financial institutions took a hit on the back of bad loans especially in the american mortgage market. but bonds have still performed well. ''if bond markets stop performing well then it is more difficult for equity markets to recover,'' said mr. hughes.  on monday, the yen rose to a three-month high of 115.37 to the u.s. dollar.   lucy macdonald, chief investment officer of global equities at rcm in london, said: ''there is a lot of volume behind the sale now, but we still see it as a correction, and it's possible that we will see another two weeks of this, wiping as much off the markets as it has already last week. we still believe that there is quite a lot of value in equities as an asset class.''  economists around asia continue to maintain that the outlook for the region's economies remains sound despite the market sell-off. many are comparing it to the sharp sell-off in emerging markets last may, a fall that had been mostly reversed by october.   some countries today published positive economic data, including strong capital expenditure figures in japan, and positive news about pension funds in taiwan. strategists said psychological factors were driving investors rather than any hard news.   this panicked trading, however, is taking place as the outlook grows slightly more uncertain in the united states. many economists are predicting slowing growth and higher interest rates, which could put pressure on the cooling housing market, particularly sub-prime borrowers and their lenders.   that scenario is likely to make it harder for investors in asia to interpret the latest turmoil in the markets, and this could suggest even more bumps ahead. the recent drops are coming after spectacular rises in some stocks and rapid growth in local economies.  fears of overheating have been especially pronounced in india, where a growth rate of more than 8 percent has been accompanied by rising prices for some consumer goods, and equities are among the most expensive in asia.india's central bank recently acted to temper inflation, and those moves could act as a drag on markets.   ''the central bank has been attempting to reduce inflation by an interest rate hike and liquidity constraints,'' said dr. subir gokarn, chief economist with crisil, a credit rating agency in mumbai.   ''the effect of monetary compression will start to show up in the coming year, and we expect growth to decline slightly,'' he said.   so far, though, no one is predicting a bear market.   even after the latest stock market declines, economists said there was still a surfeit of assets in global financial markets created by strong asian growth, high asian savings and historically low global interest rates.   that bulge of capital, which some refer to as a liquidity bubble, is likely to provide support for emerging markets once the uncertainty dies down.   ''there's still a lot money available that's going to be able to chase assets,'' said amy auster, a regional economist at anz bank in melbourne.  the decline in asian stock markets that started last week is the third such correction in three years, mr. evans, of hsbc, said.   some investors who missed the last rebound may rush back into the market this time, he predicts. ''some clients are already asking us if there are some stocks that are buyers,'' he said.  even if the u.s. does slow, mr. auster and some other economists argue, asian economies are less susceptible than they were in the past.   while exports to countries outside the region still play a crucial role in economic growth, the growth of china and india has sent trade within just the region skyrocketing. together with japan's recovery and the revival in the economies of the european union, a slowdown in the u.s. may have a minor impact in asia, they say.  that knowledge didn't stem the bleeding on monday, though.   sydney's asx all ordinaries index dropped 2.3 percent to 5642, and analysts believe it could have further to fall.   ''our market was looking a little bit expensive when it hit 6044 early last week. even ignoring what has been happening in asia and the u.s., it was due to come off a bit,'' said martin duncan, chief equity strategist at jp morgan in australia.  mr. duncan said that the bank's calculations last week valued the market at 5560, indicating that it could continue to drop. he said that he couldn't rule out the market continuing to fall even beyond that point if the bearish sentiments in new york and tokyo persisted.  philippine stocks tumbled on monday, dropping by almost 5 percent, as the market continued a consolidation that analysts said demonstrated the volatility of domestic equities.   the philippine stock exchange composite index fell 4.54 percent, or 142.46 points, to 2,997.88 points. it dropped to a low of 2,972.97 points during the day, which was worse than the index's lowest closing level of 2,982.54 points last year.   ''the market's consolidation, i think, is overdone,'' said joseph roxas, president of eagle equities inc. ''it shows the market is very volatile considering that we are not heavily traded compared to other equities in the region,'' he told the xinhua financial news service.   heavy losers included philippine long distance telephone company and ayala corporation.   last week, the 30-company index dropped by nearly 8 percent, the worst performer in southeast asia after the decline in china.   some market experts blamed the most predictable market scapegoat: hedge funds.   analysts in malaysia, for example, see hedge funds behind that market's sharp declines over the past week. ''that's the primary reason,'' said kaladher govindan, head of research at ta securities in kuala lumpur, of the hedge funds. ''we believe the bull cycle is still intact and we believe this correction should be taken as a buying opportunity.''  the benchmark kuala lumpur composite index fell by more than 5 percent today.   it has now fallen by nearly 14 percent since feb. 23, when it touched its highest point in more than five years.  overseas retail investors have also been investing in asian stocks and strategists worry that the recent volatility could mean they will retreat from asian equity markets.   ''one worry is that people panic a bit and pull their money back home, to the united states or europe, and then don't put it back quickly,'' said mr. evans of hsbc.",2007-03-06,recession

""credit default swaps"" in effect provide insurance against losses on loans (one party pays the other to cover specific losses if they occur).in theory, all this diversifies risk; in practice, it may disguise risk.companies that approve loans (""originators"") often don't hold them. loan standards may slip because originators get paid on volume. ""the originator has less reason to worry about loan performance down the line,"" says economist joseph mason of drexel university. rating agencies such as moody's and standard &amp; poor's evaluate creditworthiness. but the task is gargantuan and global in scale. moody's rates 100 nations, 12,000 corporations, 29,000 governmental units and more than 96,000 debt securities. economist charles calomiris of columbia university worries that agencies may subtly relax ratings because the more securities that are issued, the more the rating agencies make.the verdict on the new order is unsettled. no one really understands its byzantine ways. ""it has become so complex and so arcane,"" former fed chairman alan greenspan said recently, that it is ""swamping"" governments' regulatory controls. yet, it ""seemingly works because there is an implicit, invisible hand which creates . . . smoothness."" most markets, he said, self-regulate. that's reassuring -- up to a point.greed and fear are not always self-correcting. if foreign and domestic investors lose confidence, who knows what might happen? credit might become scarcer as they retreat to safe securities. interest rates might rise. a panic is conceivable. the biggest upsets ""come out of left field,"" greenspan noted.

""every single loft that's a good family loft in the west village they've bid on and they keep getting outbid.""  and the frenzy is hardly limited to the super-trendy neighborhoods. a 3,721-square-foot penthouse above 100th street listed by the corcoran group's deanna kory and karen kelley, in a building with no doorman, sold for $4.95 million after just three days on the market. anecdotes aside, one can see this major uptick borne out by statistics. according to real-estate appraiser jonathan miller of miller samuel, the average price per square foot of the top 10 percent of manhattan apartments was $1,744 in the first quarter of this year - up 13 percent from the same quarter last year. ""the higher level of sales have really eaten into inventory,"" says miller, ""especially at the high end of the market.""  and with less inventory, prices could continue to rise for a while. how, exactly, did this happen? part of it obviously has to do with the record $33 billion in bonuses on wall street last year. another part has to do with how weak the dollar has been. ""there's a ton of foreign money,"" says sukenik. ""for europeans, it's like a 35-percentoff sale - a lot of these are foreign ego apartments."" and peters thinks it has something to with the fact that most potential buyers who stayed out of the market last year are simply tired of waiting around. ""no buyer wants to be the last person to pay a big price before the market goes south,"" peters says, ""and people were apprehensive about how they were not going to be the last one to pay a lot. so you saw a lot of people sidelining themselves in '06.""  but, peters adds, ""successful people have only a limited tolerance for delayed gratification, and i think the tolerance was exhausted by the end of 2006. maybe they got that big bonus and said, 'you know what, we waited, the market didn't go south and we've got to go on with our lives.'""  also, it might have something to do with the fact that the suburbs are becoming a less attractive alternative for workaholic families. ""one of the things that's really driven our boom has been the fact that moving to the suburbs was always predicated on a 9-to-5 work day,"" says peters. ""nobody has one of those anymore. if you're working 9-to-8, adding a two-hour commute really affects the shape of your day, it affects spending time with your family, and i think that's an influential factor for a lot of people to stay in the city.""  ""people who used to buy in armonk or scarsdale or greenwich . . . [now] want new york because it's convenient for both parents,"" says sukenik. another part of the surge has been that despite all the new construction, there is surprisingly limited inventory for big apartments. ""there's a really good supply of two-bedrooms that have been selling quickly, but developers didn't want to develop too many large luxury products,"" says osher. ""basically, they didn't want to put all their eggs in one basket. luxury was kind of ignored by developers."" ""when we did the time warner center and were offering 8,000-square-foot penthouses, people thought we were crazy,"" says david wine, vice chairman of the related companies. ""but we saw the demand. you can get a tremendous amount of money from people with large families - well, wealthy families, not necessarily large. but they're demanding the space.""  does this mean that the era of the big buildings filled with small studios is coming to an end? ""we've thought about [designing bigger apartments], but we're not sure if we're going to do it,"" says elad dror, director of residential property for the moinian group, developer of buildings like the atelier, where buyers can use their american express card for their down payment. (think of the miles!) ""there's still a demand for more efficientsized homes in the city ... if the market turns, we don't want to be stuck with fourbedrooms. you're better off with one-bedrooms.""  and dror has seen why: if buyers can't get a four-bedroom, they'll just buy three apartments next to one another and build their own. ""i saw someone come into the atelier and try to buy eight apartments - six twobedrooms, and two one-bedrooms,"" says dror. despite the demand, developers like related and moinian aren't rushing out to build complexes with 300 multimillion-dollar units. for many, this latest market move doesn't feel like irrational exuberance. it feels more sustainable than what happened two years ago. ""i see right now a much more stable market,"" says broker jacky teplitzky, an executive vice president at prudential douglas elliman. ""a crazy market is much more dangerous.""

with heavy debts, at a time when the ***financial crisis** of local governments is feared to deepen following the bankruptcy of yubari city in hokkaido.the paris-based dexia credit local under dexia s.a. headquartered in brussels started business at its tokyo branch last december and has since extended about 150 billion yen in loans to 37 prefectures and cities, filling demand created by the country's decentralization efforts.the european bank has been helping local japanese governments that have to raise more funds by themselves due to cuts in subsidies and grants from the central government.robert verdier, chief executive officer at the bank's tokyo office, said in an interview with kyodo news that dexiadecided to enter the japanese market because municipalities in the country are set to have more power and responsibility in local public finance due to reforms laid out by former prime minister junichiro koizumi.\""the japanese local debt market represents 42 percent of the global market and it is natural for us to start operations in japan.we began preparing for the launch of business around 2004, when the 'trinity' reform took shape,\"" he said in japanese.the so-called \""trinity\"" reform refers to a three-point effort to slash the national government's subsidies to local governments, reduce its tax grants to them and transfer tax revenue sources from the central government to local ones. koizumi spearheaded this reform under his decentralization initiative.as of the end of fiscal 2006 on march 31, the outstanding balance of long-term debts held by japanese municipalities is estimated to have reached 201 trillion yen, or about 39.4 percent of the country's gross domestic product, according to the finance ministry.verdier pointed out that local governments will have more responsibility for their finances under the proposed bankruptcy law, which would clarify rules on local governments that go under and would introduce procedures for their early revitalization.former internal affairs and communications minister heizo takenaka, a key architect of economic reform policies in the koizumi administration, has presented a blueprint for such legislation.in starting business in japan, the bank's tokyo branch chief visited all the 47 prefectures and 64 regional banks to explain dexia's policy and to discuss possible cooperation with local financial institutions.\""we aim to have transactions with every japanese city with a population of more than 80,000 in 2008. there are about 350 such cities, and we cannot do so without the cooperation of regional banks,\"" the 47-year-old ceo said. dexia's tokyo office is staffed with 40 people, but only eight are dealing with clients, he said.verdier said dexia\""will do what regional banks do not want to do,\"" referring to the fact that the european bank will provide local governments with super-long-term loans beyond the up to 10-year loans extended by japanese regional banks.dexiagroup has been rated aaa by major credit-rating agencies and can extend longer-term loans with funds raised with its high financial credibility. japanese regional banks do not have such a business model because they rely on deposits with rather shorter maturity, dexiaofficials said.the european bank has also launched a joint financing scheme with japanese regional banks. dexiaand the bank of kyoto have sealed a contract to provide the city of kyoto with 10 billion yen over 20 years in a \""term-sliced\"" loan.the scheme brings together a 10-year, 2 billion yen loan by the bank of kyoto and a 20-year, 8 billion yen loan by dexia.after a three-year grace period, the city of kyoto will begin repayment to the two banks in the fourth year, dexiaofficials said, adding it is dexia's first joint financing effort in japan.verdier said the system of japanese regional banks, in which traditionally at least one bank exists in one prefecture, is \""very unique\"" because they maintain large market shares in their local operation areas, even though they are close to territories of \""mega\"" banks with nationwide branches.dexiais also studying the possibility of extending loans to those regional banks, verdier said.he said the public finance specialist bank could offer solutions to debt reduction efforts by japanese local governments, falling back on the group's global experience in turning around troubled municipalities.dexia, which has a market share of about 15 percent in europe and 24 percent in the united states, has been involved in revitalizing orange county in california, which went bankrupt in 1994. the banking group operates in 26 countries.\""it is difficult to sell off municipalities' assets because it could adversely affect citizens' daily lives. but we can suggest asset mobilization measures such as concession,\"" verdier, a french national, said.with the method of concession, which has widely been used in france, the public sector separates the rights to hold certain assets and to operate them, and sells the operation rights to the private sector.verdier has also inspected the northern japan city of yubari, which was once a prosperous coal-mining area but has been declared bankrupt.\""yubari failed because it has too much equipment. the area has a population of some 13,000, but the city has skiing grounds, hot springs, museums and an amusement park,\"" he said. verdier added dexiahas no plan to offer loans to the city because it is too risky.he warned there are other municipalities in japan that can follow in the footsteps of yubari, suggesting the need for such local governments to slash their assets and introduce measures to better manage them.to see more of kyodo news international, go to http://www.kyodonews.com

wakefield, a real estate specialist.the booming city economy has led to office demand in central london rising at the fastest pace ever, according to the royal institution of chartered surveyors. some 63 percent more surveyors reported a rise rather than a fall in demand in the last quarter of 2006, up from 44 percent in the previous quarter.yet such statistics can be misleading. as often happens in the office market, supply is a couple of years behind demand. there is now almost double the amount of speculative city office developments (5.5m sq ft) under construction as there was at the end of 2005 (2.9m sq ft) and planning permission has been granted for a further 6m sq ft. in 2008 alone, 11 large projects in the city are due to be completed. the development pipeline risks overshooting occupier demand.in 2006, office space in london and in the rest of great britain was snapped up more quickly and for higher rents than ever before. average city office rents hit £55 per sq ft by the end of the year and london's west end saw britain's first £100 per sq ft office letting at 25 hanover square.those who remember the ***recession** of 1990, when london was replete with new (and empty) office blocks commissioned speculatively during the late-1980s boom, will treat the current boom with healthy scepticism.in previous property cycles, peak development in office space has often coincided with a downturn in headcounts. it happened in 1990, and again 10 years later when the bursting of the dotcom bubble left offices standing empty. let us not even consider the horrors of the 1974 property crash. there is even a semi-serious theory in economics which says that skyscraper construction is the best indicator of an imminent economic collapse.but the optimists will tell us things are different this time. the london market is better supported by fundamentals, they say, unlike, for example, tokyo in the late 80s, when property prices reached astronomical prices. the bursting of the speculative bubble plunged japan into more than a decade of economic malaise. the price of some buildings crashed by 90 percent and the market was taken back to 1970s levels.back in euphoric london, rents in the city and west end are expected to grow at 7 percent-10 percent this year; but the picture could change between 2008 and 2010 as the scaffolding comes down on a raft of new developments. they include the city's biggest-ever speculative office development: british land's expansion of its broadgate complex, comprising 822,000 sq ft in two tower blocks being built over the railway approaches to liverpool street station. capacity is also being increased at canary wharf and elsewhere.those rushing to build office space should be wary of making the same mistakes as retail developers. the amount of shopping centre space under construction in britain is at its highest level since 1991; retail rental growth was at its lowest level for three years in december.optimists point to the weight of money pouring into british commercial property from overseas: £15.7bn for 2006 as a whole, according to lambert smith hampton, the commercial property consultant. of 32 £100m-plus transactions in london last year, overseas investors accounted for 59 percent of the value, says cushman wakefield. macquarie goodman, an australian group, spent £1.17bn on 14 purchases in the last quarter of 2006 alone, while the gherkin was sold to a consortium including ivg immobilien, a german investor.but foreigners are selling almost as much as they are buying. commercial property sales by overseas vendors increased from £9bn to £14bn in 2006, suggesting that astute vendors are calling the top of the market.part of the problem is that the cost of borrowing is surging: five-year \""swap\"" rates, which determine the fixed-rate borrowing costs of commercial property investors, have jumped from 4.5 percent last summer to around 5.7 percent, equivalent to a cost of 6.7 percent for many buyers of commercial property. this is proving especially damaging: previously, investors were able to borrow money at a lower cost than rental yields.historically, around two thirds of total returns from commercial property have been generated by growth in rental income. but over the past two years, around three quarters of returns have come from capital growth. rents have failed to keep pace with strong rises in prices, driving down rental yields (the income earned over a year represented as a percentage of the value of the property).fears of a slowdown deepened this week on comments from stephen hester, chief executive of british land, that further gains would depend on rental growth and development profits rather than price rises. \""those parts of the market where price appreciation has gone further than the fundamentals of customer demand may disappoint some investors,\"" he said.hester's remarks sent a shiver through the property sector. shares in british land fell 60p to £16.21 while land securities, the market leader, closed 37p lower at £22.13. adding to the cautious tone, liberty international, which has more than 80 percent of its portfolio in out of town shopping centres, revealed this week that the valuation of its retail properties rose at 7.9 percent in 2006, well below the ipd benchmark of 12.4 percent and the average of 17.5 percent for office revaluations.whether with equities or commercial property, investors (many too young to remember past setbacks), succumb to a herd mentality in chasing seemingly unending profits. when the unexpected shock occurs -- a military strike by israel on iran, for example sparking panic in the capital markets -- the herd turns on its heel, by which time it is already too late.forecasters could be correct in predicting a slowdown in returns from commercial property this year, rather than a meltdown. they distinguish between prime london offices, with modern space and bigger floor plans, and secondary property, with short leases and weak rental growth prospects.but with so many big landlords cashing in -- and tuesday's warnings from british land -- investors should pause to reflect. when even the tories start calling the top of the market, it could be time to get out.by catherine boyle and jon ashworthfor sale--hsbc hq: 8-16 canada square, canary wharf, london e14 -- for £800m-£1bn--shell mex house: 80 strand -- sale collapsed for second time in a year;

""the problem in the subprime sector is creating enough uncertainty and turmoil in the industry that the pressure on the fed is down, not up,"" william isaac, the former chairman of the federal deposit insurance corporation, told the post.  if the fed is forced to lower rates, he said, then the meltdown's net result will be less expensive money for everyone - and therefore lower the cost of buying a house.  isaac, now the chairman of secura group, a financial-industry consulting firm, said he believed banks, thanks to regulation, had kept sub-prime loans to a small percentage of their portfolios and therefore wouldn't be affected by the meltdown.  u.s. home resales dropped last month and construction of new homes held near a nine-year low, evidence the ailing housing industry continues to weigh on growth, economists said ahead of reports this week. sales of existing homes probably fell 2.5 percent to an annual rate of 6.3 million, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed before a march 23 national association of realtors report.  a report from the commerce department on march 20 may show housing starts rose to a 1.45 million annual pace from a 1.408-million rate that was the lowest since august 1997. threats of a deepening ***mortgage crisis** and rising foreclosures may cause buyers to delay purchases and builders to forego new projects in coming months, adding to housing's woes.

(less than other guys spend on golf, i will say, if it ever comes up.)preparing tax returns, unfortunately, does not lend itself to such a joint system. so i do them because i'm more of a computer geek. since our incomes aren't the same and we have separate investment gains, the tax bill isn't split evenly the way the mortgage is.so after doing a joint return on turbotax, i figure our shares of the tax bill by doing two individual returns. it only takes about an hour, and it eliminates unpleasant debate.investments are another matter. in our case, we agree on the broad strokes - favor low-cost index funds, put lots in and leave it alone. so we operate comfortably with separate accounts, each making decisions without consultation.but for people whose financial knowledge is not so equal, it's harder. the person who takes charge is subject to second-guessing.if this is a problem, try life-cycle funds, offered by most fund companies. these routinely adjust the mix of stocks, bonds and cash to suit the investor's age and tolerance for risk. set it up so money is invested every month with automatic withdrawals from your checking accounts.that way you don't need to talk about it. by eliminating a lot of the decision-making, these fire-and-forget funds can reduce friction between him and her.and that will leave more time for the things you like to do together.

""sophisticated financial firms have both the direct financial incentives and expertise to provide for effective market discipline,"" steel told regulators and financial industry executives gathered in the treasury's majestic cash room. ""we believe that the collective decisions of self-interested and informed counterparties, reviewed by regulators, provide the very best protection against financial risk."" steel's goal was to head off calls for direct regulation of the hedge and private-equity funds that have come to dominate financial markets.   steel's model is a fetching one. banks deciding on their own to upgrade their ""risk-management systems"" to make sure that they do not have too much exposure to any one borrower or asset class or trading strategy. pension funds and other institutions stepping up their due diligence before making investments, and insisting that hedge and private-equity funds provide them with background checks on fund managers and more timely information about strategies and performance. funds themselves changing their cowboy trading cultures to embrace rules and procedures and reporting requirements that will prevent anyone from taking on undue or unauthorized risks.  it's a lovely theory, but it doesn't square very well with recent history  --  the junk bond craze of the late '80s, the commercial real estate bubble of the early '90s, the asian financial boom and the tech and telecom bubbles of the late '90s. for it is at times like these, when markets are at their most frothy and in need of discipline, that lenders and investors and the highflying fund managers tend to get the sloppiest.   this is when mortgage bankers, having already refinanced every house in america at least twice, start making home loans to people with poor credit histories requiring little or no money down and an option to skip monthly payments whenever they are short on cash, as they did in 2005 and 2006.  it is at these times that banks, eager to continue delivering double-digit earnings growth, compete furiously to finance mergers and acquisitions, allowing borrowers to put less of their own money into deals and forgoing the usual conditions that would allow the loan to be called if business begins to sour. in many cases, they are even putting their own equity into the deal.   and now is when pension funds and college endowments that have held back from investing in hedge or private-equity funds finally decide to jump on the bandwagon  --  hardly the time to expect them to make demands about greater transparency or internal controls.    in other words, this is precisely when markets need good regulators, and good regulations, to make these financial intermediaries behave in the ""rational"" way that the bush administration says they are supposed to. to leave it to ""voluntary"" codes of conduct and ""market discipline"" is both naive and dangerous.  to be fair, the bush administration is moving belatedly to significantly step up surveillance of bank lending. the comptroller of the currency has issued tougher guidelines on mortgage and commercial real estate lending, and now has in his sights the loosey-goosey ""leveraged loans"" that have been used to finance corporate buyouts.   and under the aggressive leadership of tim geithner, the president of the federal reserve bank of new york, the fed is requiring the big money-center banks to upgrade their risk-management systems and subject their portfolios to ""stress tests"" to see if they would withstand a ***financial crisis** in which credit dries up and everyone tries to unwind their positions at the same time.   unregulated and highly competitive financial markets are wonderful at lots of things  --  allocating capital efficiently, coming up with innovative products, pricing and spreading risk. but, as we were reminded yesterday, one thing they are not good at is controlling their own excesses.   steven pearlstein can be reached at pearlsteins@washpost.com.

""there was a tremendous amount of momentum gathering at the end of the year, and it's carrying into 2007,"" said richard yamarone, director of research at argus research corp. home builders, automakers and their suppliers cut thousands of jobs last month, reflecting downturns in their industries that slowed the economy in 2006 and are likely to restrain growth this year as well.  but by last month, the new data show, those woes had not dampened the nation's vibrant service sector, which includes education, health care, finance, travel, entertainment and other industries that together employ more than four of every five payroll workers.   hiring in these industries more than offset layoffs elsewhere, for a strong net increase of 167,000 jobs in december and 1.8 million jobs for the year, the labor department said.   employers also boosted average wages by a healthy 0.5 percent last month, to $17.04 an hour, which added up to a 4.2 percent increase over the 12 months ended in december, the biggest yearly gain since 2000.   and consumers found their wages went farther at year's end because of falling inflation, which has tumbled along with fuel prices since the summer. that helped encourage holiday spending: sales at the major retail chains rose by a solid 3.1 percent in december from a year earlier, the international council of shopping centers said this week.  ""nothing is more powerful than employment. that is the determinant of whether you spend . . . and that is fueling economic growth,"" yamarone said.   with solid spending at home and a weaker dollar boosting demand from abroad, u.s. manufacturers increased their activity in december, rebounding from a decline in november, the institute for supply management reported earlier in the week.  the commerce department also said this week that spending on nonresidential construction projects rose in both october and november, helping cushion the continued decline in spending on home building.  yesterday's report was too much good news for wall street's taste. after a raft of mixed economic signals earlier this winter, investors had been betting the federal reserve would cut interest rates soon to fuel economic growth. but that looks increasingly unlikely, and stock and bond prices fell yesterday and investors abandoned their earlier assumptions. analysts predicted the federal reserve will hold steady well into this year.  fed policymakers raised short-term interest rates steadily through last june in an effort to cool the economy just enough to bring down inflation without causing a ***recession**  --  a goal called a ""soft landing."" while price pressures moderated last year, the central bank wants them to weaken further this year.  now, the economy appears likely to grow a moderate 2.4 percent this year, after growing faster than 3 percent in each of the last three years, according to the average forecast of the 54 top business and university economists surveyed last month for blue chip economic indicators, a monthly publication.   the blue chip group also predicted inflation will ebb a little this year, while unemployment creeps up to average 4.8 percent, higher than last month's rate, but still low historically. none of the experts surveyed predicted a ***recession**.  ""we are successfully in a soft landing,"" said diane swonk, chief economist at mesirow financial. she predicted the economy would rebound strongly enough later this year to cause the fed to raise its benchmark rate.   the fed, however, isn't expected to raise interest rates in the near future because it is uncertain how much further the housing market will sag.   home sales rose in november, fostering hopes they will stabilize soon. but home construction is likely to continue declining for many months while home builders work to reduce their inventories of unsold homes, analysts said.  housing-related industries  --  including residential construction, contractors, real estate agents and brokers  --  shed 19,000 jobs last year, a sharp reversal after adding 306,000 in 2005, according to the economic policy institute, a research organization focused on labor issues. analysts forecast more such losses this year.  manufacturing employment also appears likely to continue to slide, after falling by 72,000 workers last year. nearly nine of every 10 factory jobs lost in the second half of last year reflected cuts by employers in businesses related to housing or automaking, said david huether, chief economist at the national association of manufacturers.  construction employment fell in each of the last four months of last year, but rose by 39,000 jobs over 2006, as gains in nonresidential work more than offset cuts by home builders, the labor data showed.  but because of the continued expansion of the nation's service industries, the nation's overall job market tightened last year, brightening employment prospects for many workers.  unemployment averaged 4.6 percent, the lowest level in six years, down from an average of 5.1 percent in 2005.  the jobless rate among white workers rose to 4 percent in december from 3.9 percent in november. african american unemployment fell to 8.4 percent last month, the lowest level since july 2001, from 8.6 percent in november. latino joblessness fell to 4.9 percent from 5 percent.  the average duration of unemployment shrunk last year as well, to 15.9 weeks as of december from 17.4 weeks in december 2005.  the ranks of the so-called ""long-term"" jobless workers declined as well, to 16 percent of all the unemployed last month, from 18.5 percent a year earlier, labor said.

"49","4N2T-04R0-TX4T-C2KM-00000-00.txt","should the federal reserve set a particular ""hard"" target for inflation and adjust monetary policy to achieve that goal? or should it determine a ""soft"" target -- something other than inflation, perhaps unemployment -- and not be required to dogmatically adjust monetary policy to meet some specific number? in making this choice, should the fed be concerned about the political backlash over which target it selects?there's much talk these days about the concept of inflation targeting, hence these questions. there are many ways of managing inflation, but the practice is best illustrated by the price rule, or the fed's policy of determining the federal funds rate -- the interest rate charged by banks as they lend to each other -- to impact some measure of inflation, such as the dow jones aig spot commodity index. arthur laffer, the famed supply-side economist who popularized the idea that cutting tax rates can lead to higher tax revenues, has suggested that the fed, under paul volcker in the 1980s, shifted monetary policy from a quantity rule (attempting to control the supply of money) to a price rule (attempting to control the price of money). subsequent studies of the relationship among commodity prices, the federal funds rate, interest rates, the stock market, and the economy demonstrated that the fed indeed shifted to this price rule.left out of this analysis, however, is the growth of the money supply. maybe that's a good thing. traditional economists, and monetarists in particular, prefer to believe that inflation is too much money chasing too few goods, and that a policy of raising interest rates ultimately reduces inflation. in the ""old"" days, prior to the emergence of the price rule, the fed targeted growth in the money supply to control inflation. the monetary authority would set ""bands"" within which various monetary aggregates were allowed to fluctuate, and when these bands were penetrated, it would take action by either raising or lowering the fed funds rate to get the growth in money back into the bands. since the resultant swings in interest rates were substantial, this practice had a negative influence on the economy. but then came the price rule, a less-volatile guide for adjusting interest rates, and with it an era of much smoother monetary sailing.still, there's a problem with the theory that inflation is caused by too much money chasing too few goods: this theory often doesn't work in the real world, no matter what traditional measure of money is selected. if the theory were ironclad, instances to the contrary wouldn't exist. but they do.to get a handle on the concepts of too much money and too few goods, we can look at the growth rate in what is called the ""narrow"" money supply. this historically popular measure of money can be directly controlled by a central bank that watches over a country's economic output as measured by real gross domestic product. to be a useful monetary aggregate, this measure should provide the monetary authority with the level, and trajectory, of inflation. for example, if the money supply is growing rapidly while the enonomy is also expanding rapidly, then the resultant inflation could be low. on the other hand, if a monetary authority were flooding the system with this narrow measure of money while no economic growth of any significance was occurring, then high inflation should be the obvious outcome.but again, this is an imperfect theory, as a recent real-world example shows.the following chart displays growth in the narrow money supply for an industrial country that implemented a traditional monetary policy between 1993 and 2005 (i use both annual growth rates and a three-year moving average to insure that the distortions of one-year changes are minimized):the average money-supply growth rate over this period was 9.3 percent, so if this country were one of the fast-growing economies of eastern europe or the far east, one might assume that its money growth was not inflationary. so let's take a look at the growth in this country's real economy:real economic growth over this period was a paltry 0.8 percent. money-supply growth of 9 percent per year coupled with gdp growth of less than 1 percent? i wouldn't fault you if you guessed that this country is a banana republic.but let's now look to the consumer price index, which can help verify the theory that inflation is too much money chasing too few goods:this chart provides evidence that above-average growth in the money supply had virtually no impact on a traditional measure of inflation. in other words, the shocker is that inflation is non-existent in this example, even though there was a demonstrated surge in the country's money supply and almost ***recession**-like economic conditions.finally, let's take a look at interest rates:while short-term interest rates are influenced by monetary policy, long-term interest rates supposedly include an inflation premium that will protect long-term bond investors from future inflation. under this assumption, one interpretation of this last chart is that bond investors were not demanding any real premium for future inflation, even though the money-supply growth appeared to be inflationary.these statistics reflect economic conditions not in a banana republic or an underground colony on mars, but in japan, where the relationship between traditional measures of money supply growth and inflation have failed to occur in recent years. this analysis indicates that either we need another approach for explaining inflation, or that the appropriate target for validating the relationship between the money supply and inflation has not yet been identified.",2007-02-16,recession

will be removed from seven of the authority's 15 drop-off sites, including the cambridge springs site.sometime next month, the authority plans to auction off the recyclable materials processing center that it operated in west mead township. the center was shut down in january in an effort to reduce the program's operating losses.\""people have to realize there is a net cost with recycling. despite all the funding and effort put into the program, it was still something that the county got into a ***financial crisis** over,\"" said guy mcumber, sustainability coordinator for the state department of environmental protection's northwest regional office in meadville.brenda schmidt, the solid waste authority's recycling coordinator, said she did not have the program's operating figures from 2006. but officials said earlier this year that the rural recycling program lost $75,000 in 2005, and expected a greater loss in 2006.schmidt points to a few reasons for the operating losses.a 2005 state court ruling deemed it illegal for counties to collect administrative fees from landfill operators. that cut about $120,000 from the program's budget, schmidt said.the authority also lost out on receiving the recyclables that the city of meadville is mandated to collect from its residents, as the city has opted to send its materials to erie, she said.state law only mandates recycling in meadville and titusville, crawford county's two third-class cities.even though crawford county has one of the most successful recycling programs in the state, the revenue from recyclables in no way covered all the costs associated with running the rural recycling program, mcumber said.that revenue, augmented by a $200,000 annual subsidy by the county, fell far short of making the program financially sound, he said.\""we're very concerned, but it's just a reflection of the economics of recycling,\"" mcumber said.the decision to scale back operations hasn't been a popular one.many people who utilize the collection bins in conneautville aren't happy with the realization that they will soon have to travel to conneaut lake or meadville to continue recycling, said joyce mcmillin, the borough's secretary/treasurer.\""they left so many bins in the southern part of the county and none up this way,\"" mcmillen said.residents in spartansburg, in the northeastern part of the county, are equally unhappy, as the program has had the best response in that area, schmidt said.\""but once we talked to folks and said we're losing this much money, they understand,\"" she said. \""they couldn't do that in their own home. and certainly, with taxpayer money, we can't continue to do that.\""the authority will continue operating its collection program through two collection points in vernon township and single sites in cochranton, conneaut lake, hydetown and in randolph, richmond and west mead townships.it is also working to rebuild the program, though without operating its own processing center.the authority is seeking grant money through the dep to fund a different type of collection system in some kind of contracted program, mcumber said.officials hope that system can be in place sometime in 2008, schmidt said.in the meantime, some municipalities are exploring alternatives for providing their residents with recycling opportunities closer to home than the authority's remaining collection sites.cambridge springs borough manager peggy lewis said she is looking into what it would cost to provide drop-off service or curbside collection to borough residents.\""we don't want to put it in the garbage. right now our garbage contract only allows people to put out three 30-gallon bags,\"" she said.to see more of the erie times-news, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go

(bond prices and yields move inversely.)countries are setting up such funds, which usually provide scant details of their holdings, amid unprecedented growth in global foreign exchange reserves. after rising at an annual rate of 6% from 1997 to 2001, reserves grew 20% every year since.central banks typically hold their reserves in ultrasafe securities, such as u.s. treasuries and euro-denominated government bonds. asian countries have stockpiled enormous reserves as insurance against a repeat of the region's 1997 ***financial crisis**. countries such as south korea and thailand now have more than adequate protection against future shocks.since the end of 2005, china has added almost $400 billion to its reserves, which exceed $1.2 trillion. in march, china set plans to create a $200 billion investment fund.

""you don't need to create a system from scratch,"" kaine says.kaine would expand state funding to make sure pre-k programs  are available to the poorest children currently eligible; he would expand the number of eligible children by including the working poor and the lower middle class; he would fund programs in areas that now have none; and he would establish a voluntary quality rating system, which he hopes would  attract pre-k classes that serve wealthier children, too.in the end, he claims, about as high a percentage of virginia's 100,000 4-year-olds will end up in quality pre-k as in states that have adopted universality as their goal. but his first principle would be this: ""i believe that no child should be turned away from a high-quality preschool experience because their parents can't afford it, or because their community does not have the preschool programs they need.""it seems self-evident to meet those needs before picking up the tab for, say, mclean children whose parents today have no problem paying for preschool. but there are two compelling arguments on the other side, kaine says.one is that ""poor kids can benefit"" from going to school with children in other income brackets, ""and actually richer kids can, too."" he hopes some of that will still happen, as local jurisdictions piggyback on state help to entice middle-class children into their pre-k programs.the other is political, and it's an argument that crops up in debates over social security income tests and across a range of other programs: as kaine says, ""it becomes harder to cut if it's not a poor person's program.""will that unfortunate rule doom kaine's step-by-step approach? so far, it seems maybe not. a number of republicans welcomed his announcement last week. the consensus on the value of pre-k education for ""at-risk"" children seems to have spread so wide that the governor may be pushing on an open door. and the legislature may be so relieved that he is not demanding a universal entitlement program that it will be more disposed to compromise.on the other hand, virginia's legislature has never been particularly hospitable to anything perceived as a poverty program. kaine's deftness will be tested again in directing resources to where they're most needed while making the case that the benefits will trickle up.fredhiatt@washpost.com",2007-08-20,recession

""but clearly it will ease the risks from the housing slump.""still, the controversial plan quickly attracted opposition.housing advocates said it will help only a small segment of those at risk of losing their houses. the center for enterprise, a conservative think tank in washington, d.c., called the plan ""bad policy"" because it altered the terms of hundreds of thousands of contracts, making investors worldwide think twice about investing in the u.s. mortgage business.closer to home, peter nigro, professor of finance at bryant university, called the plan a ""bailout"" and said it would hurt investors, banks and, ultimately, taxpayers.instead of a government bailout, ""let each bank and other financial institution resolve the problems that are least costly to them,"" he said. ""they are in a better position to assess their losses compared to the government … in cases of fraud and predatory loans, let's go after the companies and brokers that made them.""the controversy also sparked comments from lawmakers in congress, and the candidates for president, all of whom suggested steps that needed to be taken to avoid a housing ***recession**.there were calls for federal legislation to give state and local governments more authority to temporarily broaden their tax-exempt bond programs to include mortgage refinancing. others wanted passage of bills expanding the availability of federal housing administration insured loans to refinance loans about to reset.by week's end, housing analysts were evaluating all the proposals. soon, something has to get done. there's too much pressure from the danger the housing mess poses for the economy. how effective the federal response is still remains to be seen.eventually, all bad housing cycles end. the one during the 1991-1992 ***recession** was over by 1994.this one's still developing. only when it's past will history rank just how bad it was.",2007-12-09,c("recession", "recession", "recession", "recession")

""i think we need to have some sort of equalization in the law so we're not leaving people stranded.""the idea behind the proposal approved monday is that legislators would give a total of $52.8 million in income tax from the uniform school fund to the utah state board of education each year to be put toward school buildings. though some school districts might raise property taxes to get a maximum amount of money from the state, no district would have to, eastman said. some school districts would see millions in additional money.some, such as sen. howard stephenson, r-draper, however, worried that schools might suffer in an ***economic downturn** when income tax revenue could decrease. eastman said it would be up the legislature in that case to determine how much money schools would get.state school board member mark cluff said the school board supports equalization but is concerned about using income tax revenue.""our concern is we're pulling from other programs that we feel we need to have,"" cluff said.bruce williams, with the davis school district, said business administrators across the state are in favor of the new proposal.""there's always going to be competition,"" williams said.

""odds are, businesses will hold tough. i think they'll be more cautious, but they'll remain aggressive enough to ensure the economy avoids ***recession**. but it's a close call.""zandi remains somewhat optimistic because businesses are holding onto so much cash, allowing them to spend money without borrowing. and corporate profits have been strong, too.companies outside of farming and banking had $1.5 trillion in liquid assets at the end of the first quarter, up 3.5% from a year ago according to the latest available data from the federal reserve. earnings were up more than 10% in the second quarter, the biggest gain since the third quarter of last year, according to standard &amp; poor's.""the companies have a nice war chest built up,"" s&amp;p's analyst howard silverblatt says.greg stoner, president of jasper, ind.-based masterbrand cabinets, the second-largest cabinet maker in north america, says his firm will continue to invest.

""it's just been very frustrating, because we tried to grow so damn quick.""tom doyle, owner of appleton, wis.-based robotics maker qcomp technologies, faced a similar quandary after booking $5 million in sales in just a month from food and glass industry producers. the $8 million manufacturer needed to buy parts and hire employees, but when doyle tried to increase the company's line of credit 50% to $900,000, the bank asked him to pledge personal assets as collateral.advertising curtailedcloser healthcare of tequesta, fla., which sells mail-order diabetic supplies, has ceased all marketing -- a roughly $20,000 monthly expense -- because stricter lending criteria by its bank, suntrust, has meant a lower credit limit. the firm must borrow money for such expenses because it takes insurance companies six months to pay claims, says michael rothenberg, company head of business development.growth, he says, has been cut in half. ""it's unfortunate, but it's not a company-fatal event,"" he says. ""it's just a matter of weathering a few bumps in the road.""but other firms say financing doesn't seem to be a problem. dunkelberg, economist for the national federation of independent business, says members aren't complaining about lacking access to cash.

""businesses are very fickle sometimes.""it's such caution that would be unwelcome news for the economy. even if companies have access to money, they have to feel confident enough to spend it and to hire to make a difference.in a survey of more than 30 economists conducted by usa today last week, nearly all marked down their forecasts for business spending in the third and fourth quarters. but the reductions were not dramatic.""most of the fundamentals for business investment are still quite positive,"" jeffrey lacker, president of the federal reserve bank of richmond, said last week.

""before i make a service call, check the detector's back-up battery,"" he suggested.i didn't know there were two sources of power. the detector was telling me it needed a new battery. problem solved.* when the markets seem exuberant, is cash the answer? when you open third-quarter mutual fund, retirement account and brokerage statements, don't expect to see much change from june 30. a little irrational exuberance in the equity markets at summer's end helped overcome most of the 10 percent shrinkage portfolios experienced between mid-july and mid-august.but don't jump to the conclusion that your investable assets are merely treading water. if your portfolio is diversified across a broad mix of stocks, income investments and cash-like accounts, the total return, year-to-date, is probably 11 percent or more - close to the historical average annual return of the stock market. i'll accept that performance any year.analysts say it likely will be three more months before the federal reserve's recent half-point cut in the federal funds rate target - the first in four years - filters through the economy. while there is talk of an eventual ***recession**, i see no need to get defensive and accumulate a large chunk of cash.but if you have cash in hand, remember that some banks are still deposit-hungry. also, online banks and taxable money-market mutual funds continue to offer an annualized compound yield (with dividends reinvested) in the 5.3 to 5.4 percent range. these so-called ""money funds,"" though not fdic-insured, hold only high-quality debt with less than a year to maturity.investors who move in and out of the market, attempting to anticipate economic cycles, usually lose ground. a recent morningstar study found that an investor who bought a typical stock fund in 1997 would have achieved a 7.4 percent annual return during the past decade. in contrast, actual investors reported an average annual gain of just 5.9 percent over this period.* time is running out on the 2006-2007 federal energy tax credit. you might jump to the conclusion that all windows and exterior doors, or furnace, heat pump and central air-conditioning systems that carry the energy star logo qualify for a bottom-line credit of as much as $500 on your 2007 tax return. many retailers want you to believe this, but the devil is in the details.for instance, a year ago i replaced a wooden, 5-foot patio door with a wider ""clad"" model that had the energy star logo. the dealer claimed the door qualified for the tax credit program because it met u.s. environmental protection agency energy-efficient guidelines. i was skeptical, and during a call to the manufacturer discovered that the new door qualified for a federal tax credit only if installed in a deep south state such as texas, alabama or florida.this credit (a dollar-for-dollar reduction in what's owed on your tax return) is worth going after, especially if you plan to install specific energy-efficient products by the end of 2007.* marketers interrupting your evening? get serious. about five years ago, you may have signed up for the national do not call registry on its web site, donotcall.gov. if you are now getting sales calls from strangers, call the site to renew your registration. the same is true for anti-spam and anti-junk-mail registries maintained by the direct marketing association. its internet site is dmaconsumers.org.want to limit your exposure to product catalogues? send an e-mail to optout@abacus-us.comif you have a lessons learned topic to suggest, you can call gene kelly at (402) 421-2861, write to him at 2611 bretigne circle, lincoln 68512, or e-mail him at genekelly@windstream.net",2007-10-06,recession

""anyone who opposed his rule and strategy [for handling junk mortgage securities] was tossed out. four good people walked the plank just this year,"" said one source familiar with o'neal's bungling of about $30 billion of merrill's assets, which now could be worth barely pennies on the dollar.  merrill had early warnings of the housing ***recession** months ago but, instead of meeting the crisis head on, kept dubious junk paper on its books, despite pleas from senior management to sweep it from the house before the mess could cause billions of the firm's dollars to evaporate.  that's exactly what happened, with merrill saying last week that it was bracing for as much as $12.5 billion in write-downs, wall street's worst showing.  a chorus of investors and banking analysts was quick to call for o'neal's ouster, casting him as the new public face of wall street's woes.  o'neal, 54, had been regarded as merrill's savior at the start of the year -  with a $91.37 million pay package, including bonuses and stock awards.  he'd impressed shareholders by tripling the company's stock in just four years and had shaved costs by firing 12,000 people.       but the bottom fell out when the stock tumbled this summer from a high of $98.68 to a low of $59.14 on thursday.  news of his possible ouster sent shares soaring by 9 percent friday. shareholders' stakes were enriched by $4.5 billion, and o'neal gained a $16.7 million paper profit -  on prospects of his own firing.  the seeds of his demise were sown in the summer of 2006 when he got rid of the firm's most knowledgeable asset- and mortgage-backed security pro, principal investment chief jeff kronthal. he was wall street's guru on the subject and had helped develop and trade the first mortgage-backed securities in the early 1980s.  early that summer, according to merrill executives, kronthal began warning the firm's traders and bankers about the firm's inability to ""clear,"" or trade, the increasing amounts of junk mortgage paper it generated.  in late july 2006, fed up with kronthal's concerns -  which, admittedly, had been threatening the lucrative fee flows merrill was reaping from its cdo-issuance machine -  o'neal fired him.       executives and clients of the firm told the post that merrill's mistake came in ignoring every sign that the asset-backed securities markets were ready to overheat this spring and in choosing instead to continue to pump in more cdos to keep the balls in the air.  one by one, they fell.  now o'neal, facing an increasingly hostile board, probably wishes he'd kept his ears -  and his mind -  open.       on the move? merrill lynch's ceo stanley o'neal is losing the confidence of his board over the $8.4 billion in third quarter write-downs and the billions more expected in the fourth quarter. 10/5: merrill pre-announces a $5.5b write-down for 3rd quarter. 10/9: merrill downgraded by jpmorgan chase and credit suisse. 10/24:  merrill reports $8.48b write-down in quarterly earning filing. close  $66.09 + $5.19 ",2007-10-28,recession
"65","4R9R-R120-TW8F-G07G-00000-00.txt","the enduring rally in real estate investment trusts finally ended this year as turbulence in the credit markets rattled the confidence of commercial investors and effectively halted the frenetic pace of reit privatizations.   now the question on some people's minds is whether the downturn means that a lingering bear market is looming.   for more than seven years -- from november 1999 through january 2007 -- reit shares soared in value, providing giddy investors with average annualized returns of 23.6 percent, according to the national association of real estate investment trusts. (in 2006 alone, reits climbed by an average of 34.4 percent.)  but the market is poised to finish 2007 sharply lower. this year through thursday, the reit composite index compiled by the trade association had a negative return of 11.39 percent. the index of equity reits, which own commercial property and constitute the bulk of the market, has fallen 8.63 percent.  meanwhile, losses for mortgage reits, which originate loans and invest in mortgage-backed securities, were a staggering 43.5 percent, on average.  by contrast, the standard &amp; poor's 500-stock index is up around 6.4 percent so far in 2007.   ''it's been a very ugly year,'' said mike kirby, a principal of green street advisors, a real estate research company in newport beach, calif., echoing the sentiment of many others. ''it's one of the worst performances we've seen in reit land in a long time.''  industry analysts and money managers, though, had been predicting for a while that the reit market would run out of steam.   fortunes reversed, they say, just as a giant private equity firm, the blackstone group, was completing its $36 billion acquisition of equity office properties trust, the nation's largest office landlord. ''that was when the market peaked,'' mr. kirby said.  indeed, part of the reason for the reit run-up was the record number of mergers and acquisitions, about half of which involved leveraged-buyout deals by private firms with voracious appetites for commercial property. (as investors tried to predict which reit companies, or sectors, might be singled out next, share prices surged.)  last year, there were 23 announced transactions totaling $106.15 billion, including the assumption of debt, according to snl financial, a research company. but so far this year there have been only 18 transactions totaling $68.69 billion, snl said. only one deal has been announced since july 25.  analysts attribute the falloff to a reluctance among financial institutions to provide loans for buyouts in light of the credit squeeze that swept through the subprime mortgage market as the housing market softened.  because reits themselves typically have only moderate levels of debt, analysts say, they have generally fared well in the credit crisis; the noted exception, of course, has been mortgage reits.   nonetheless, concern has grown that the credit problems may eventually weaken the economy and therefore hurt demand for commercial space.  ''real estate fundamentals are still in pretty good shape by historic standards,'' said ross l. smotrich, a senior managing director and reit analyst at bear stearns. ''occupancy is in the low- to mid-90 percent range across the board by geographic and property types, and there's positive rental rate growth.''  but even though these business fundamentals are relatively strong, securities prices have dropped. reit performance, mr. kirby noted, ''had been pretty decent at the operating level and poor at the share level.''  whether reit shares stay depressed is open for debate. the last bear market, in which annualized losses averaged 13.18 percent, lingered for 23 months until november 1999, according to the reit trade association. the one before that lasted 14 months, from august 1989 to october 1990, it said; average annual returns during that market were a negative 20.86 percent.  ''reits have been in a bear market pretty much all year,'' said ralph l. block, the author of ''investing in reits'' (bloomberg press, 2006) and the publisher of the essential reit, a newsletter. ''i think the key to forecasting what reit stocks do in 2008 is determining whether the u.s. is going into a ***recession**.''   paul e. adornato, a senior reit analyst at bmo capital markets, agreed. ''this is the key uncertainty going into 2008,'' he said, adding that investors ''will be focusing on the macroeconomic issues -- rather than real estate fundamentals -- such as job growth.''  but mr. smotrich says he also thinks that  investors must overcome a perception problem. ''i call it a perceptual connection,'' he said. ''they're hearing that real estate is softening, so they think that that must mean all real estate is bad. they don't stop to think that the value of their homes in which they live and the office buildings in which they work are two very separate markets.''   at the same time, reits ''seem to be lumped in with all financial stocks right now,'' he added, noting that shares of financial services companies have been beaten down because of losses in their mortgage-backed securities businesses.  still, brad case, the vice president for research and industry information at the national association of real estate investment trusts, maintains that reits have a ''low correlation'' with most other stocks and bonds -- in other words, they tend not to move in tandem with them -- and that this makes them good portfolio diversifiers.  now may be a good time to buy, he added, citing industrywide data that shows reits over all trading at a significant discount to asset value. according to mr. kirby of green street advisors, the current average discount to net asset value is around 20 percent.  mr. smotrich suggests that investors focus on the larger, so-called blue-chip reits ''with excellent management, strong balance sheets and good business models.'' they also pay out regular dividends.   he particularly favors reits in the industrial sector -- one of the stronger performers, with an average return of 9.13 percent so far this year -- which invest in warehouses and distribution centers. this sector includes companies like prologis trust and amb property. both are rapidly expanding onto other continents. ''their global exposure will insulate them to some degree to the economic softness domestically,'' he said.  mr. smotrich is less enthusiastic about the office sector, which has posted losses of 14.52 percent, on average, so far this year, and the apartments sector, which has had negative returns of 18.69 percent. multifamily housing ''will face some head winds based on the oversupply of single-family homes for sale,'' he said. ''landlords have less pricing power.''   while mr. block agreed, he said he remained bullish on avalonbay communities, which develops and manages luxury apartments, mainly on the east and west coasts and in illinois. ''the markets in which they own are really not subject to overbuilding,'' he said.   on the other end of the spectrum, mr. adornato says he likes sun communities, which owns and operates manufactured housing communities. (that sector fell 13.15 percent.)  ''we think that the single-family credit crisis would cause americans to downsize,'' he said, ''and manufactured homes represent a much more affordable housing alternative.''  meanwhile, louis w. taylor, a managing director at deutsche bank securities, says he thinks that health care reits, which invest in properties like hospitals, medical buildings andnursing homes, are also likely to hold up well during an ***economic slowdown**. (the sector is up 2.94 percent.) he says he likes healthcare realty trust because ''they have a development pipeline not priced into their shares.''  ''there are fears about the economy,'' mr. taylor said, ''but there's not a whole lot of fear about health care demand.''",2007-12-09,c("recession", "economic slowdown")

""just as subprime home buyers are being shut out of the housing market, soon americans will find that their credit is no longer good at car dealerships or department stores.""it's a vicious cycle. the credit crunch could put a crimp on retail sales, which would further slow the economy. and an ***economic slowdown** will push consumers to cut spending even further. that's why so many economists and wall street analysts are hoping consumers will keep their shopping bags full.""to avoid ***recession**, americans are going to have to keep on spending,"" said university of maryland economist peter morici. ""this will require borrowing at much higher rates on credit cards now that easy home mortgages are gone.""however, mounting credit card defaults could soon put visa and mastercard into the same hot water that mortgagers such as countrywide and citicorp are in, morici added.there are growing signs that consumers are already nearing their limit. less than half are comfortable with their overall level of debt, according to a poll last month by experian and gallup. only one out of five said they would be comfortable making a major purchase in the next three months.""the consumer cannot remain so resilient indefinitely,"" said nigel gault, an economist with the investment consulting firm global insight.this could be one reason why retail sales during this holiday season have been disappointing. at best, they have barely kept ahead of inflation. the national retail foundation estimates that this has been the slowest shopping season in four years. target stores, one of the nation's largest retailers, said its same-store sales might have actually declined by a percentage point or so.george whalin, a retail management consultant in carlsbad, said he doesn't believe san diego numbers have been that bad. historically, san diegans tend to spend well in ***recession**s. during the ***recession** of 2001, for instance, san diegans increased their spending by 5 percent, even as spending dipped 11 percent in the silicon valley and 7 percent in san francisco.but whalin warned that worse times could be in store for 2008.""i'm very skeptical and cautious about next year,"" he said.

"72","4PMY-BTK0-TW8F-G0DJ-00000-00.txt","not long after the dot-com industry collapsed a few years ago, retailing became the hottest sector in commercial real estate. online shopping was no longer viewed as a threat to bricks-and-mortar stores, and rising housing values made it easy for people to borrow more money -- and spend it. shopping centers began changing hands at ever-escalating prices.   two years ago, retail real estate began losing some of its allure for investors as the condo conversion craze took over. more recently, investors have gravitated toward office buildings and hotels.  now many people in the retail real estate industry are bracing themselves for a slowdown in spending as the subprime ***mortgage crisis** and the decline in housing values continue to send ripples through the economy.   and shopping centers have been caught in the credit squeeze that has transformed the capital markets. private buyers, who were once able to finance 95 percent or more of the cost of a transaction, are being driven out of the market because such high leverage is no longer available.   according to investors, brokers and analysts, deals are taking longer to complete, and prices -- at least for the second- and third-tier properties -- are declining by as much as 10 percent.  ''what we have seen is a lull in the market, what you might call the calm before the storm,'' said fritz mcphail, the owner of blue ridge capital, an atlanta real estate company that specializes in acquiring troubled strip malls. ''we are seeing prices change. we are seeing deals blow up. people are calling us back a second time to see if we want to consider another offer.''  about 80 percent of the choice regional malls in the best locations are owned by publicly traded real estate investment trusts. not surprisingly, they are expected to withstand the credit squeeze better than older shopping centers in less desirable settings.  but even top mall operators are being affected by the tightening lending standards.  two real estate investment trusts, the  simon property group and macerich, agreed this year to sell three malls they have jointly owned for nearly a decade -- lindale mall in cedar rapids, iowa; northpark mall in davenport, iowa; and southpark mall in moline, ill. -- to a private company that relies on a high degree of leverage. but the buyer was unable to complete the deal.   the current debt market could be an obstacle for the pyramid companies, the owner of 20 shopping centers in new york state and massachusetts, including palisades center in west nyack, n.y.  the company announced in april that it was exploring ''strategic alternatives,'' including a sale. publicly traded companies, which limit the leverage they use to 60 percent, are not likely to be interested in pyramid because most of the company's properties -- unlike the palisades center -- are in ''low-growth or negative-growth markets,'' said arthur m. coppola, the chief executive of macerich.   while demand for space remains strong at the high-end regional malls, the average vacancy rate at strip malls, which are generally anchored by supermarkets, has been creeping up for more than two years, even though relatively little new space has been developed, according to sam chandan, the chief economist for reis, a new york research company.   mr. chandan said the vacancy rate stood at 7.3 percent at the end of june and was expected to rise to 7.6 percent by the end of the year, its highest level since 1995.  in the second half of the year, he said, about 26.2 million square feet in strip malls will be completed, which would contribute to an oversupply. ''that's the highest level of completions we've seen in many years, and it coincides with the slowdown in the underlying drive for space,'' he said.  the strip mall vacancy rate has accelerated sharply in some metropolitan areas, including trenton, dallas and oakland, calif., according to abigail marks, an economist at torto wheaton research, a boston company owned by cb richard ellis.   in metropolitan areas with strong population growth, like phoenix and orange county, calif., new shopping centers are easily attracting tenants, according to a report by the costar group, a research company in bethesda, md. but new centers in several other metropolitan areas -- memphis, cleveland, indianapolis, tucson, southwestflorida and nashville -- are having trouble leasing space, costar said.   and retail chains are closing stores faster than they did in 2005 and 2006. during the first half of this year, merrill lynch counted 6,126 closings, an 11 percent increase over the period a year earlier. store closings are not necessarily bad news for shopping center operators, who are often able to find a new tenant for a space at higher rent.  many retail specialists draw a distinction between shopping centers that cater to lower-income shoppers, who are more likely to lose their homes through foreclosure, and centers that serve more affluent customers. ''the upscale mall guys, while not completely insulated, should be better than the lower end,'' said steve  sakwa, merrill lynch's analyst for real estate investment trusts. ''i don't think the credit crunch is really killing the people of boca raton.''  donald c. wood, the chief executive of federal realty investment trust, a rockville, md., company that specializes in strip malls in inner-ring suburbs, where there is little land to be developed by competitors, said his company had not experienced an increase in vacancies. the future is likely to be less rosy for property owners in areas ''with less people, with less money and less barriers to entry,'' he said.  similarly, retail space in new york and other densely populated cities has continued to command high prices because ''you can't build very much of it,'' said robert m. white jr., the chief executive of real capital analytics, a new york research firm.   with some big-box retailers like home depot reporting declining sales, shopping centers with such stores, known in the industry as power centers, may take a bigger hit than those whose tenants sell food and other necessities. ''the power centers are seeing the impact directly,'' said jim sullivan, an analyst at green street advisors. ''there may be a perception that power centers are riskier than they had been.''  like residential mortgages, commercial mortgages are pooled, sorted into risk categories and sold as bonds.   in the past several weeks, demand for these bonds has weakened, with investors demanding to be paid more for the risk. as a result, said pete bethea, a principal at burnham real estate, a brokerage firm in san diego, lenders are changing the terms of deals. ''even if people thought they had their deal locked, there's no such thing,'' he said.   small-scale investors are being shut out, mr. white of the new york research firm said. ''the trouble in the debt market is having an immediate impact on them,'' he said.   as buyers are required to use more of their own equity, prices could fall as much as 15 percent but are not likely to slide much further, said matthew ostrower, a senior analyst for real estate investment trusts at morgan stanley. he said private equity funds had raised tens of millions of dollars to spend on real estate but were waiting for the gap to narrow between what sellers are asking and what they are willing to pay. ''where that price is will be the collective decision of all these buyers,'' he said.",2007-09-12,mortgage crisis

""certainly not before labor day, and there's no guarantee it will comebackafterlaborday. there's a lot to work through, including the unwinding of clo warehouses. it's clear though that the terms offered to private equity players of late won't be seen again for a long time.""meanwhile, the 4.2% drop in the dow jones index seems a reasonable downgrade for reduced takeover prospects, especially because the sell-off focused heavily on companies thought to be in play. there may be some further downgrading of the financial sector as the impaired outlook for buyouts filters through to earnings estimates for investment banks.for the balance of the market, the outlook for profits and of the economy should be paramount. recent news on this front has been mixed, but not altogether negative. second-quarter growth was boosted by a surge in business spending, which has been some time in coming and which bodes well for continued productivity gains. this is important because in recent years, price increases have been minimal, meaning that corporate profit growth has stemmed heavily from productivity increases.at the same time, falling home prices and high gasoline prices have finally taken a toll on consumer spending. the folks at isi are estimating that employment in july rose by 160,000 (versus the consensus of 125,000), but also that hiring of temporary workers - a good leading indicator of payroll - is softening.market experts are also not convinced that the federal reserve will cut rates later this year, despite strong sentiment to that effect in friday's futures markets. if they are correct, the market may trade in a fairly narrow range in the near term. this may be one of those times when investors have to become more discerning and seek out companies that really are growing and that offer particularly good value. in other words, making money the old-fashioned way.peek10021@aol.com",2007-07-30,financial crisis

broth and vegetable oil. others prefer the more natural look and taste of a free-range, organic fowl.and many in both camps are quite fond of a smaller bird that bridges the great turkey divide, one that glows like a jewel in candlelight and can be stuffed with candy, cranberries and soup.the turkeys made by the l.e. smith glass co. of mount pleasant, westmoreland county, have been gobbling up space on thanksgiving dinner tables since the first one rolled out of the annealing oven in 1943.smith glass turkeys have been sold by williams-sonoma, martha stewart and dozens of other smaller retailers, in catalogs and stores all across america.\""it's one of our most popular items,\"" said manager rick rimel, who in september oversaw production of thousands of red turkeys for williams-sonoma.\""we call it ruby. williams-sonoma calls it cranberry,\"" said mr. rimel, a big, friendly bloke with an appalachian twang. \""i've made them in pinks, blues, cobalts. i made them in every color you can think of.\""when a retailer places a large order, mr. rimel makes a few thousand extra in case they need more, and also to supply smith's own factory sales room.\""right now i'm stocked pretty good for thanksgiving,\"" he said, with turkeys in amber, ruby, clear and a new bicolor version called \""amberina,\"" with a ruby body and amber tail feathers produced by cooling the tail faster than the body. because mr. rimel, who also mixes the glass batches, has had a lot of requests for turkeys in green milk glass, he's making those this week, too.the factory, which celebrates its centennial this year, is one of a handful of american companies still producing handmade pressed glass. marking the occasion is a new book about smith glass, the first to chronicle its history and production.\""smith is a company that has continually reinvented itself,\"" writes tom felt in \""l.e. smith glass company: the first one hundred years\"" (collector books, $29.95). depression glass dinnerware, hurricane lamps, lamp shades, perfume bottles, cigarette lighters, even lenses for automobile headlights all rolled out of the smith factory.mr. felt had access to the company archives, including products, catalogs and, from 1910 to 1959, handwritten annual inventories. but making sense of it all was a challenge, partly because smith only occasionally gave its products an identifying mark (since the late 1960s, some smith glass pieces -- but not the turkeys -- have been marked on the bottom with an \""s\""). at almost 400 glossy, full-color pages, the large-format book still couldn't cover all of smith's output.with fenton art glass co. of williamstown, w.va., smith shares the distinction of being one of only two handmade tableware glass companies in america to have reached the century mark. fenton announced in august that it soon would close at the age of 102, but an outpouring of customer support has kept it alive.a fragile businesssmith glass has had its troubles, too, and for similar reasons. buoyed by a revival of interest in pressed glass and burgeoning sales through catalog and internet retailers, the previous owners, like fenton's, had upgraded and expanded, but during the ***economic downturn** after 9/11, slower sales and rising natural gas and health care costs left smith unable to meet its debts.smith stopped production in june 2004 and was nearing liquidation when scottish-born pittsburgh businessman william kelman came to the rescue. he purchased the company early the next year, confident there's a market for traditional pressed glass.in the late 19th century, pittsburgh and environs was the pressed glass capital of western pennsylvania, with one-fourth of america's factories producing a third of its glass, heinz history center curator anne madarasz writes in the catalog to the center's ongoing exhibit, \""glass: shattering notions.\""the process has remained much the same for almost 200 years. on a recent monday, gatherer george eicher, a 38-year smith employee, and a crew of four were making rose-colored goblets for stores that sell to the amish and for a california hotel.mr. eicher dips the gathering rod into the furnace and pulls out a gob of molten glass, then turns 180 degrees and lowers it into a mold, where the presser snips it off and lowers the plunger, forcing the glass deep into the mold. the turning-out man removes the goblet and passes it to the glazer, who places it on a turntable that heats and smooths the edges of the rims. the carrying-in man walks the goblets over to the annealing oven, or lehr, three at a time on a long wooden fork, where they bake for two hours.some of the goblets since have joined about 100 other glassware items stacked in smith's signature black boxes on the sprawling warehouse floor: platters, punch bowls, candlesticks, baskets and a menagerie of covered dishes -- rabbits, hens, ducks, swans, fish, squirrels and turkeys.the mysterious mr. smithlouis e. smith, the tall, portly man whose name smith glass bears, was with the company only for its first four years, and that wouldn't have surprised those who knew him. mr. felt, in his book, ferrets out the peripatetic, new jersey-born glassmaker who seems to have begun his career in martin's ferry, ohio, where he was manager of the decorating works of buckeye glass co. in the late 1880s. he moved on to the rochester tumbler co. in beaver county before starting the l.e. smith manufacturing co. there; it made cut glassware.by 1898, mr. smith was president of the pittsburg glass and ceramic co. on the south side, but in january 1900, he was in zelienople with his wife and three children, working as manager of the empire glass co.two years later, he was head of the decorating department at westmoreland specialty co. in grapeville, near jeannette, where he met charles wible. by 1906, he was head of the mckee-jeanette glass works' decorating department, which mr. smith and mr. wible offered to spin off as a separate decorating company. they used smith's name because, as a wible descendant told mr. felt, \""people have trouble remembering the name of wible.\""in 1909 smith glass acquired the anchor glass co.'s mt. pleasant factory, relocated there and began making its own glass, including patterned tumblers holding german-style mustard, which smith also made.it was mr. smith's own recipe, according to a 1969 article by the late pittsburgh press history writer george swetnam, who described him as a \""gourmet cook\"" with his own restaurant -- something mr. felt wasn't able to verify.mr. smith left the company in 1911, despondent, according to family tradition, over his divorce, and became a salesman for westmoreland glass. he died in obscurity in the early 1930s.talking turkeysthe first pressed glass turkey was born and bred in western pennsylvania, made about 1891 by challinor, taylor &amp; co. of tarentum; it continued in production in the original molds to about 1900 at challinor's successor firm, the united states glass co. other companies made similar turkeys, including cambridge glass co. (in business 1902-1958) of cambridge, ohio, and the l.g. wright glass co. (1936-1999) of new martinsville, w.va.smith turkeys, which retail for $29, are the smallest of the lot, 7 inches high compared to 8 to 81/2 inches high for the rest.today the competition comes from overseas, \""but it is extremely poor quality glass,\"" mr. felt writes. williams-sonoma carries some chinese imports, mr. rimel said, but those amber birds have a less distinct face than smith's birds'.smith turkeys, which are tested for strength by immersion in hot and cold baths, have evolved a little over the years. the older smith birds, produced up to the late 1970s, had tail feathers \""that folded up in more of a v-shape, and its head was a little bit different,\"" mr. rimel said.production was revived in the mid-1990s after martha stewart, on her television program, set a table with decades-old smith turkeys. the media still help drive the company's production: when a black cake plate appeared on the halloween cover of a recent country living magazine, smith was besieged with orders.for pressed-glass lovers, a visit to the smith factory store is a kid-in-a-candy-shop experience, with benefits: they also can arrange to tour the factory. in the sales room, objects are segregated by color and opacity on display shelves: white milk, green milk (\""jadeite\""), clear, cobalt, black, pink, sage, blue, amethyst and amber. on the lower level, where bargains can be had, seconds and overstocks are spread out on long tables and shelves.to celebrate the centennial, everything's on sale in the warehouse, to which customers usually don't have access, from nov. 16-25.tours of the factory ($7 per person) are available year-round 9 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. monday through friday; walk-ins are accepted but bus tours should call ahead. l.e. smith glass co. is located at 1900 liberty st., mount pleasant; call 724-547-3544.turkey barley soupsmith glass turkeys can hold cranberries on thanksgiving and then be used as individual soup tureens the day after. here's an easy recipe for an old-fashioned turkey barley soup.6 cups chicken broth or turkey broth1 to 2 cups diced cooked turkey1/2 cup pearl barley1/2 cup chopped onion2 celery stalks, chopped3 carrots, sliced1 bay leaf1 teaspoon dried leaf thyme1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (about 2 teaspoons dried)combine all ingredients in a slow cooker. cover and cook on low for 6 hours, or simmer over low heat on the stove for 1 hour, or until the carrots are tender and the barley is soft. serves 4 to 6.-- www.southernfood. about.com.""

""my instinct would be the opposite. this is an indication that firms would be interested in taking base compensation to the next level as well.""base pay among the top firms is now around $160,000 for a first year associate, a steep increase over the standard $125,000 new york's top firms paid their rookie lawyers two years ago. the pay had been at $125,000 for several years before that, without any firm raising the ante. but the $160,000 figure, still less than a year old, may not last for much longer. it has already spread to other cities across the country, causing discontent among associates here who contend with new york's higher cost of living.that parity between associate pay here and elsewhere ""can't last long"" a professor at columbia law school, john coffee, said. "" it's natural that new york will distance itself from the national salary scale. there will be some jockeying among the firms to see who can lead the race.""but it is not clear how many firms would be willing to go higher. the sub-prime ***mortgage crisis** has left firms' structured finance and real estate departments with less legal work overall, analysts say. while the major firms are generally well diversified in their legal practice, firms with a focus in these areas may be more affected by the ***economic downturn**.""some firms are going to be embarrassed and won't be able to match any new increment,"" mr. coffee, who worked at cravath 30 years ago, said.the end of the year bonus that cravath announced on monday provides an extra $10,000 to $50,000 to associates based on seniority above last year's bonus. a blog that follows associate pay closely, abovethelaw.com, has reported that firms including debevoise &amp; plimpton llp; simpson thacher &amp; bartlett llp; paul, weiss, rifkind, wharton &amp; garrison llp; davis polk &amp; wardwell; milbank, tweed, hadley &amp; mccloy llp have all since matched cravath, with only minor variation. most of the announcements came friday.for associates who joined in 2006, the bonus amounts to $45,000, which is $10,000 more than last year's bonus for first year associates. second years this year will receive $55,000, which is $15,000 more than last year.these firms are all new york-based and it is unclear whether out-of-town firms with offices here will feel the need to compete.the end-of the year bonuses do not compare with what wall street hands out around this time of year, and they are not likely to keep lawyers from leaving for more lucrative jobs in finance. but they could encourage senior associates, who might be considering leaving to work as an in-house counsel, to stay on the partnership track.""it is possible that the dollars and cents that some corporations can afford to pay will not keep up with what law firms can pay their associates,"" the head of the associate practice group at the legal recruiter major, lindsey &amp; africa, sheri michaels, said.one employer that certainly isn't keeping pace is the federal government. the wall street journal's law blog noted this week that second-year associates at these top new york firms will be earning, with bonuses, $225,000 a year, which is more than the $212,100 that the chief justice of the united states, john roberts, is paid by the taxpayers. a significant number of the 145 commenters on the blog post expressed the opinion that the law firm associates work harder.",2007-11-02,c("mortgage crisis", "economic downturn")

""i always like the way edsels looked,"" he said. ""i started working on them and developed a passion."" his mother, mamie, added that maybe his interest went further back in time. ""he came home from the hospital in one,"" she said.brown, of cincinnati, ohio, said he fell in love with edsels in 1970 when he saw one in a parade. ""gee whiz, that thing's as long as freight train,"" he remembers thinking.he said he now has a collection of seven edsels, with the citation the latest he has had restored. at the far end of the yard, his white 1960 edsel villager station wagon is due to be restored.brown said edsels are now more popular than they've ever been and the club is in the final stages of a membership drive that has added 75 names. there are about 500 members of the club.""i love the extra design, the look,"" he said, pointing out the exhaust pipe deflectors and hooded rear-view mirrors on the citation, which was the top of the edsel line.opening the door, he showed off the push-button gear shifting on the steering wheel, the rotating bubble speedometer and automatic adjustment of the brakes. there's even a button that lubricates the car.and then there is the design, classic 1950s detroit with a difference. and that was the point for designers roy brown and jim arnold, brown said. they wanted a car that would stand out from the crowd. so instead of fins, a landing deck of a rear-end and the infamous horse-collar grille up front that led to paar's put down. (the original design called for a smaller one, but the engineers said it would restrict the airflow.)jerry thayer of franklin, mass., said he has owned his black 1959 edsel ranger since 1986. ""i liked what i saw,"" he said, adding that the car, with its black-and-silver upholstery, is nearly all original with 86,000 miles on the clock. ""i drive it under 500 miles a year,"" he said. now he is selling it to make a down payment on a condo ""up north,"" although admitting ""it's kind of part of me.""lachapelle, who is chief of visitor services at the salem maritime (salem, mass.) and saugus iron works (saugus center, mass.) national historic sites, said many factors played a part in the debacle that ended up costing ford about $250 million, but none more so than the changing economic climate.he said ford built up expectations for the edsel by hyping e-day - sept. 4, 1957 - with promises of futuristic design features and technological innovations.""it was like a hollywood premiere when they first came out and it was pandemonium at the dealerships,"" he said.

""ford refused to give the edsel a separate factory. in today's terms, it was priced like a lexus but poorly built.""at the same time, the edsel line was priced within the entire mercury line, causing confusion for would-be buyers who wondered if they were buying a mercury with bits and pieces added on. another factor was robert mcnamara, the future secretary of defense under presidents kennedy and johnson, who joined ford in 1946 and rose to become the first non-member of the ford family to be named president. mcnamara was focused on the ford line and never took to the company's other lines, including the edsel. he cut its advertising budget and then convinced henry ford ii that it was never going to take off and to end production.even its name did not help, with market surveys finding people associated it with ""pretzel,"" ""weasel"" and ""dead cell."" indeed, gayle warnock, head of public relations for edsel, warned management that the name would cost the company sales, according to brown. he said warnock resigned soon after the car was introduced.lachapelle, who owns a black 1958 citation convertible that he is having restored, said he has loved the cars ""since i was 12."" he said his first car was a 1958 citation four-door hardtop and ""from that point on i always had an interest in the cars and their preservation.""ford made the edsel in a variety of styles - ranger, pacer, corsair and citation - in 1957 (the 1958 model year) and sold about 68,000 in the u.s. and canada. just over 47,000 1959 models sold the following year with about 2,859 1960 models selling before ford yanked it off the showroom floor in late 1959. fewer than 6,000 survive.ironically, the following year, the car that was to have been the next edsel was sold as the 1961 mercury comet and sold well, according to brown.lachapelle said as it became apparent the edsel was failing, ford went to desperate lengths to promote it, including sponsoring a one-hour edsel show starring bing crosby, rosemary clooney and louis armstrong, ""but they were trying to resuscitate a corpse here.""this was followed by a campaign to ""name the pony,"" with every dealership being shipped a pony to give away, the sponsorship of wagon train on tv and an offer to give ""buyers any color they wanted - even if it meant painting an already existing blue car black.""but as brown noted, while the executives at ford's headquarters were wracking their brains over the commercial failure of the edsel, one drew them to the window overlooking the parking lot.""and there were all these smaller cars,"" he said.

moran p.l.l.c., said that will cause problems for many suppliers.``i just hate to see volumes moving into 14 (million)-to-15-million-unit range,'' fitzgerald said. ``i think it would be very serious. i think it would have a serious impact on the (automakers') cash flows ... and it would quickly accelerate the bankruptcies of smaller, tier-two suppliers and even tier-one suppliers.''a year ago, fitzgerald said, nobody in the automotive industry was even thinking about the potential for a u.s. ***recession**.this year, northville-based csm worldwide forecast that production of cars and light trucks in north america will fall to about 15 million, down from 15.3 million in 2006 and 15.8 million in 2005.next year, north american production could fall to around 14.6 million to 14.7 million, according to csm.during its third-quarter conference call, livonia-based trw automotive holdings corp. warned that the detroit 3 could begin cutting vehicle production before the end of this year.``the big three in north america are focused on inventory management,'' trw president and ceo john plant said during a conference call with analysts oct. 30. ``at this point, we are monitoring production really closely and are prepared to react quickly to minimize the profit impact in the fourth quarter.''joe langley, senior analyst for north american forecasting at csm worldwide, said the drop-off in production is more serious than the small percentage might suggest.that's because the numbers mask a tremendous change that has occurred in recent years as the detroit 3 have scaled back production and asian automakers with plants in north america have increased production.on the other hand, langley sees a long-term benefit from lower production.``it's a change in the infrastructure in what's going on in north america,'' he said. ``you have a lot of excess capacity and labor costs that drove production for the big three, and now you are starting to see them taking out capacity ... and really focusing on quality volume rather than just market-share volume.''michael robinet, vice president of forecasting for csm worldwide, said the production cuts by general motors corp., ford motor co. and chrysler l.l.c. are due in large part to new labor agreements passed by the united auto workers this fall.``it needed to take place five years ago, but now they have a labor contract that allows them to make the changes,'' robinet said.chrysler's announcement earlier this month to cut four vehicles from its lineup in 2008 is an example of that newfound flexibility, he said. chrysler said it would cut the dodge magnum, the chrysler pt cruiser convertible, the chrysler pacifica crossover and the chrysler crossfire convertible.but while the decline of total vehicle sales in the united states will hurt some suppliers, others will thrive. suppliers with production and sales overseas are benefiting from the declining value of the dollar.trw automotive, borgwarner inc. of auburn hills and visteon corp. of van buren township all said they benefited from favorable currency exchange rates during the third quarter.visteon, for example, said favorable rates boosted total sales of $2.55 billion by $100 million.and while production is likely to fall in north america next year, the global automotive industry continues to expand.in its annual automotive study published in october, pricewaterhousecoopers l.l.p. predicted that total global automotive sales will increase from 65.2 million in 2006 to 77.6 million in 2014, or 19 percent.global growth markets include china, india, russia and brazil.as a result, north american suppliers that suffered through the pain of aggressive reorganization plans in recent years are now reaping the rewards globally, said consultant korth of irn.suppliers that are doing well typically have high margins, proprietary technology, production capability oversees, a diverse group of global customers or some combination of those characteristics.``we've been saying for a while that the automotive environment is now an environment of big winners and big losers,'' korth said.brent snavely: (313) 446-0405;

"81","4PDJ-71M0-TW8F-G4KN-00000-00.txt","the wild swings in the stock market over the last few weeks have reawakened memories of the technology crash of 2000 in which many small investors lost their savings. but this time around, market experts say, ordinary investors seem less vulnerable than the professionals who have taken a beating.  the excesses in the financial markets are now generally believed to reside in complex mortgage securities and other esoteric investments, not in the traditional stock and bond markets where average americans put their money.  over all, analysts say that the situation may well get worse before it gets better. the standard &amp; poor's 500-stock index has fallen about 6.4 percent since july 19 when it set a record high. it is considered normal for the market to fall as much as 10 percent periodically during bull markets. that leaves room for the dow jones industrial average to fall another 640 points, to 12,600.   in the near term, average americans can expect more turmoil and uncertainty in the stock market and may have a harder time obtaining mortgages. but investment experts say that ordinary long-term investors, as long as they are diversified, should worry less.   ''there is no immediate crisis'' for the long-term individual investor, said michael poulos, a managing director at oliver wyman, a consulting firm that specializes in financial services. ''this is mostly a case of relatively rich, sophisticated investors who made big bets on the credit spreads that will have big problems. it is not joe 401(k).''  the crisis has reverberated throughout the financial markets, but the greatest impact has been felt by investors in mortgage securities and those involved with corporate buyouts. also, hundreds of thousands of homeowners are facing resetting rates on loans and may not be able to refinance easily into another loan.  last week, the federal reserve and other central banks lent $293 billion to banks to ensure that there was enough money to lend to borrowers.  but even skeptical market watchers acknowledge that stocks, which average americans buy through mutual funds, appear less vulnerable than the market for complex debt investments typically bought by hedge funds, pension funds and insurance companies. since bottoming out in late 2002, stocks have risen at a more modest pace than in the 1990s -- an average of 13 percent a year. and despite recent losses, the dow is still up 6.2 percent since jan. 1.  the ratio of stock prices to corporate profits for the standard &amp; poor's 500 stock index is 16.8, slightly above the average of 15.7 since 1935, but below the average of 22.8 since 1988.   on numerous occasions in recent decades, stocks have fallen 6 percent or more in a short period. in most cases -- in 1998, 1999 and 2003, for example -- stocks began rising again soon. in a few cases, most notably 2000, the initial declines signaled larger problems.  there is no way to predict where the market will go, but many investment specialists say the economy is fundamentally strong. companies are adding jobs and real wages are rising. (on monday morning, japanese stocks increased slightly, with the nikkei 225 index up 0.48 percent at midday.)  still, the fact that the markets in the united states are falling despite a vibrant global economy has been unnerving to individual investors.  ''how concerned should i be?'' asked shanna rendon, a 53-year-old retired lab technician in grand junction, colo. ''i am managing the finances for our retirement -- and i don't want to lose money.''  she and her husband lost more than $1 million of their retirement nest egg in the crash that followed the boom of the late 1990s. but they have been able to recover over the last few years as the stock market rallied.  ''i look back at the tech wreck and see overvalued companies,'' she said. ''now, i am looking at a country where the economy has a problem because of a lot of credit. what is going to prop up the economy with all that debt?''  in the short term, investors like ms. rendon can probably expect more turmoil. expectations of future volatility -- though they are far lower by one popular measure than they were early in this decade and in the late 1990s -- have surged to their highest levels in more than four years.  ''certainly for young folks, this is a shocker,'' jim t. swanson, chief investment strategist at mfs investments in boston, said about volatility. ''but the 20-year numbers suggest that this is a return to normal.''  individual investors should figure out how comfortable they are with the risks of their investments, while considering their financial circumstances and investment goals, advisers say.  many financial experts suggest investors consider moving their money to  less risky investments like treasury notes and blue-chip stocks, which they expect to now perform better than junk bonds and smaller stocks.  but they caution against impulsively buying and selling stocks based on a short-term market swing. ''none of us are going to be able to time our moves,'' said liz ann sonders, chief investment strategist at charles schwab. ''if you take a more systematic approach, then you are sort of putting yourself on the right side of the market. but it's not human nature to do that. we love to ride our winners until something happens.''  for now, anxiety is particularly high among well-heeled investors in some hedge funds that have reported losses. many are flocking for the exits, forcing portfolio managers to sell otherwise solid investments.  and the demands could intensify this week: wednesday marks 45 days before the end of the quarter, the deadline by which most hedge fund investors must notify the funds if they want to redeem their investments.  stock prices could also decline further if investors no longer expect the big premiums that private equity firms have been paying to buy public companies.  financial stocks, which often lead the market, are down 10 percent for the year. many banks and brokerages were riding high in recent years because of the lucrative fees they earned during the buyout boom. a big test will come when bankers have to raise money for big private equity acquisitions like the ones that are pending for the first data corporation and sallie mae.   in the mortgage market, the prognosis is expected to be bleak for some time. a glut of unsold properties in many parts of the country suggests that home prices have further to fall.  optimists, however, note that the american economy is running smoothly. unemployment is at 4.6 percent, near record lows.   borrowing costs are rising but are still cheap compared with historical rates. public companies are flush with cash and corporate profits are growing at a robust pace. investors have trillions of dollars sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the right time to jump into the market.  larry reno, a retired government worker who lives in atlanta, is among the would-be bargain hunters. ''there are a lot of stocks out there that are getting beat up and have good fundamentals,'' said mr. reno, who calls himself a long-term investor. ''to me, it's like the day after christmas, when all the department stores put the stuff on sale.''   to place the current period in context, many experts are studying the credit crisis in 1998, when russia defaulted on its debts and the hedge fund long-term capital management collapsed. ''in 1998, 60 subprime companies went out of business,'' said meredith a. whitney, an analyst with cibc world markets. ''and that didn't send our economy into a ***recession**.''  in fact, the stock market climbed higher after the fed intervened to save long-term capital and the international monetary fund lent money to russia.   but other market watchers contend that employment and profits are often lagging indicators and that the american economy is already slowing.   as adjustable-rate mortgages are reset, many homeowners will face higher monthly housing payments. that could force some families to cut back on spending.  sallie l. krawcheck, head of global wealth management at citigroup, said investors should be ''making adjustments for risk and, if appropriate, exploring possible buying opportunities.''  they should focus on whether ''the market volatility bleeds over into the health and behavior of consumer,'' she said. ''that is the key for the real economy.''",2007-08-13,recession

""my biggest frustration remained the president's unwillingness to wield his veto against out-of-control spending,"" greenspan wrote. and he weighed in briefly but pointedly on the iraq war: ""i am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows: the iraq war is largely about oil."" bush took office in 2001, the last time the government produced a budget surplus. every year after that, the government has been in the red. in 2004, the deficit swelled to a record $413 billion. ""the republicans in congress lost their way,"" greenspan wrote. ""they swapped principle for power. they ended up with neither. they deserved to lose."" in 2006, voters put democrats in charge of congress for the first time in a dozen years. greenspan's memoir, ""the age of turbulence: adventures in a new world,"" is scheduled for release monday. the associated press purchased a copy saturday at a retailer in the washington area. the book is a recollection of his life and his time as fed chief. greenspan, 81, ran the fed for 18 1/2 years and was the second-longest serving chief. he served under four presidents, starting with his initial nomination by ronald reagan. he says he began to write the book on feb. 1, 2006, the day his successor -- ben bernanke -- took over. a caption under a photo of bernanke's swearing-in has greenspan saying he was ""very comfortable leaving the post in the hands of such an experienced successor."" the ex-fed chief writes that he regrets the loss of fiscal discipline under bush. ""'deficits don't matter,' to my chagrin, became part of republicans' rhetoric."" greenspan long has argued that persistent budget deficits pose a danger to the economy over the long run. at the fed, he repeatedly urged congress to put back in place a budget mechanism that requires any new spending increases or tax cuts to be offset by spending reductions or tax increases. large projected surpluses were the basis for bush's $1.35 trillion, 10-year tax cut approved in the summer of 2001. budget experts projected the government would run a whopping $5.6 trillion worth of surpluses over the subsequent decade after the cuts. those surpluses, the basis for bush's campaign promises of a tax cut, never materialized. ""in the revised world of growing deficits, the goals were no longer entirely appropriate,"" greenspan noted. bush, he said, stuck with his campaign promises anyway. ""most troubling to me was the readiness of both congress and the administration to abandon fiscal discipline."" greenspan, in testimony before congress in 2001, gave a major boost to bush's tax-cut plan, irking democrats. he argued then that a tax cut could help the economy deal with sagging growth. the economy slipped into a ***recession** in march 2001. the downturn ended in november of that year. surpluses quickly turned to deficits after the bursting of the stock market bubble and the 2001 ***recession** cut into government revenues. government spending increased to pay for the fight against terrorism and receipts declined because of a string of tax cuts. the bush white house defended its fiscal policies in light of the greenspan book. ""clearly those tax cuts proved to be the right medicine for an ailing economy,"" white house spokesman tony fratto said. the 2001 ***recession** was a mild one. ""tax cuts contributed a portion to early deficits, but those tax cuts accelerated growth over time,"" fratto said. he added: ""we're not going to apologize for increased spending to protect our national security."" greenspan said he was surprised by the political grip that bush exerted over his administration. the bush administration turned out to be different from ""the reincarnation"" of the ford administration that greenspan said he had imagined. ""now the political operation was far more dominant."" greenspan was chairman of the council of economic advisers under president ford. greenspan enjoyed a good relationship with bush's predecessor, bill clinton, ""a fellow information hound."" they also were on the same economic page. during the clinton administration, budget deficits turned to surpluses. greenspan recalled a conflict with the white house when bush's father was president. the elder bush wanted lower interest rates and challenged greenspan's inclination to raise them because of inflation risks. for bush's father, the economy was his ""achilles' heel, and as a result we ended up with a terrible relationship."" the economy went into a ***recession** in the summer of 1990 and emerged from it in the spring of 1991. many supporters of the elder bush blamed greenspan's tight-money policies for the ***recession** that contributed to bush's loss to clinton. greenspan says in the book he does not lament the loss of america's manufacturing base. ""the shift of manufacturing jobs in steel, autos and textiles, for example, to their more modern equivalents in computers, telecommunications and information technology is a plus, not a minus, to the american standard of living,"" greenspan wrote. greenspan's memoir includes his early years growing up in a new york city neighborhood of low-rise brick apartment buildings filled with families of jewish immigrants, his stint as a jazz musician and his decades as a washington policymaker. on other topics, greenspan: • says he believes looser mortgage terms for ""subprime"" borrowers -- those with spotty credit histories or low incomes -- raised financial risks. however, he says the benefit of expanded home ownership in the united states was worth the risk. • questions whether global powerhouse china can continue its economic successes over the long run if it doesn't incorporate democratic processes. however, he predicts that if beijing continues to move ahead on free-market principles ""it will surely propel the world to new levels of prosperity."" • predicts the most important economic decision u.s. lawmakers and courts will confront in the next quarter century will be to clarify rules involving intellectual property -- patents, copyright and trademarks. • proposes lowering barriers to skilled immigrants and improving education to narrow income inequality.

"93","4PTM-M620-TW8F-G0D1-00000-00.txt","c(""colorful banners, draped across buildings like giant flags, urge people driving through baltimore's rebuilt downtown neighborhoods to move into the new condos and apartments inside. ''sophisticated urban living w/garage and gated off-street parking'' one sign declares in the long campaign to gentrify the central city.  until recently, the ballyhoo was not much needed. the revival was going well, in baltimore and in other cities making the transition away from manufacturing. but now, the banners are the most visible evidence of the incipient damage to this major american city from the turmoil in the national economy.  as home sales dry up, tax revenues fade, foreclosures surge and hiring declines, a new caution is inhibiting activity.   ''i don't see a ***recession** mentality,'' said atwood collins iii, executive vice president of the m&amp;t bank corporation, who complains that the national media are amplifying the bad news. ''but you would have to be deaf, dumb and blind not to be a little infected by what is being said.''  how broadly the infection will spread is still not clear. by no means is every metropolitan area around the country experiencing similar problems. even in baltimore there are strengths. the port  is thriving from trade. financial services companies are strong, and the federal government is channeling money into medical research and to companies that locate here, having won contracts with the national security agency, which has headquarters nearby.    but the fallout from the housing downturn is already showing up as a setback in this struggling city's effort to reinvent itself as a robust commercial center, one in which a spruced-up and rebuilt downtown has attracted new residents, particularly young people, as well as more office workers.  in recent years, the housing boom propelled this process forward, here in baltimore and in cleveland, memphis and pittsburgh, among other cities. that is no longer true.   ''now that the bubble is gone,'' said nigel gault, chief domestic economist at global insight, ''the downdraft is potentially a huge negative for growth in these cities and in the country as a whole.''  in baltimore's case, deserted commercial buildings and dilapidated row houses were rebuilt into middle-class condominiums, town houses and rental apartments. in less than a decade, the number of downtown housing units doubled, according to robert m. aydukovic, vice president for economic development at downtown partnership of baltimore.  ''you finally see people on the streets carrying shopping bags and pushing baby carriages,'' mr. aydukovic noted during a walking tour.  the housing bubble brought perhaps the biggest lift. it became the impetus for a major expansion of baltimore's initial redevelopment project: the inner harbor complex of hotels, museums, offices and restaurants, much of it built more than 20 years ago.   to help fill the new housing, real estate agents have promoted baltimore as a bedroom community for washington, arguing that condos and rentals here are much less expensive than in the nation's capital 30 miles away. that price break, they argue, more than justifies the 50-to-60-minute commute each way by train.   the sales pitch worked well for a while, particularly among young people. ''they were getting priced out of the d.c. market so they started buying condos and row houses near the railroad station,'' said arnold graf of the industrial areas foundation, a national organization that is helping the large population of impoverished families here, some once employed in manufacturing. ''now, with the slowdown, these properties aren't selling very well anymore.''  construction is still highly noticeable downtown. there is unfinished housing, as well as hotels and office buildings, encased in scaffolds, on many central city streets. but in august homes that sold in the greater baltimore area had been on the market for 84 days, on average, up from 58 days a year earlier and 44 in 2005. nearly all of that sales slowdown, according to metropolitan regional information systems, was concentrated in the city rather than the five suburban counties.  the slowdown is mirrored nationwide. sales of existing homes fell 4.3 percent in august, the national association of realtors reported recently, to the lowest level in five years. and new-home sales plunged 8.3 percent to their worst level in seven years as prices dropped sharply.   nominally home prices here have held up -- averaging just over $323,000 in august, virtually unchanged from august of last year -- but only 2,868 units were sold, down from 3,460 a year earlier. trying to explain the sharp drop, joseph t. landers iii, executive vice president of the greater baltimore board of realtors, suggested that half the decline might be attributed to the withdrawal of investors who, during the boom, bought a property, fixed it up and then resold at a profit.  among homeowners, foreclosures have more than doubled in just a few months, reaching 1,630 in greater baltimore in the second quarter alone, compared with 682 in the january-to-march period, according to maryland's department of housing and community development.  in the spring quarter, 25 percent of the foreclosures were in the city itself. the numbers are up even in belair edison, a stable working-class neighborhood of neat two-story row houses adjacent to a picturesque wooded public park.   the homes are occupied mostly by teachers, police officers, firefighters, shop owners, university workers and similarly employed wage earners. some had originally taken on standard fixed-rate mortgages and then, to save money or take out equity, had gotten into trouble by refinancing at variable rates, according to mark sissman, president of healthy neighborhoods, a nonprofit organization that helps homeowners.   ''they were offered loans that in some cases did not require them to escrow for taxes and insurance, and they took them,'' mr. sissman said, ''and then they wake up with a six-month tax bill and if they can no longer refinance, they are in trouble.''   several nonprofit groups have stepped up assistance to families in trouble, helping them renegotiate loans or, if necessary, sell their homes so the houses will not be left empty, starting the deterioration that can turn a neighborhood into a slum.   despite the drag from the housing downturn, there are several countervailing forces sustaining baltimore's economy. the port operation, with 18,000 workers, thrives. among other traffic, all of the vehicles that toyota imports for sale east of the mississippi come through here. and the baltimore-washington international airport is a magnet for light industry and commerce.    for all the recent upheaval in the markets, financial services remain an important strength of the local economy. legg mason and t. rowe price have headquarters here, employing a total of nearly 7,000 people.  on another front, companies holding contracts with the national security agency, the huge spy agency that monitors communications, increasingly settle in baltimore's southern suburbs, not far from n.s.a. headquarters.  ''the baltimore economy is propped up a bit by the war on terror,'' said andrew frank, a  deputy mayor.   the johns hopkins university complex, the largest employer in the metropolitan area, with 45,000 on the payroll at the university and its huge medical and research operation, is in the early stages of an 88-acre expansion.  slum neighborhoods are beginning to give way to new buildings for research, medical care, housing and retailing. but much of the funding for the project -- and for a similar one that the university of maryland is undertaking across town -- is from the federal government, particularly the national institutes of health. that funding is not growing as much as it was earlier in the decade.   so the project is proceeding more slowly, which, in turn, has fostered other restraint.  ''our faculty is in control of much of our spending,'' said richard a. grossi, vice president and chief financial officer of johns hopkins medicine, ''and when they see n.i.h. holding back, they hold back in their behavior.''  mr. grossi noted, for example, that employment at the university-medical complex is growing now at 700 or so people annually, down from about 1,000 a couple of years ago. but  johns hopkins, he said, is still a powerhouse in the metropolitan economy.  ''relative to what others are doing in baltimore, we are still a driver,'' mr. grossi said. ''but relative to what we were five years ago, today we are a little more cautious.''  local government spending is about to be squeezed as well, as tax revenue tied to housing -- particularly a transfer tax that is collected each time a house is sold -- starts to decline. that falls hardest on the city itself, home to nearly 641,000 of greater baltimore's 2.7 million people. while the overall unemployment rate for the metropolitan area is only 4 percent, in the city it is nearly 7 percent.  thanks in large part to the transfer tax, the city had budget surpluses for three fiscal years, through last june. ''the growth in that revenue was off the charts,'' mr. frank, the deputy mayor, said. ''that is now over. it means that our flush days are behind us.''  in the inevitable budget tightening ahead, some of the city's black leaders are concerned that funding for recreation centers will be frozen at the present $5 million annually. they see the 40 existing centers as a necessary antidote to a surge in gang violence, offering after-school activities that take teenagers off the streets. they want the budget doubled, so the city can add 30 more centers.   ''we have a rising gang problem that is starting to cripple certain neighborhoods,'' said bishop douglas i. miles  of the koinonia baptist church. one of those on the list, he said, is the ''previously stable'' belair edison. "", 
""a front-page article on oct. 4 about the economy of the baltimore metropolitan area misstated the extent to which sales of homes had slowed in the city of baltimore, as opposed to the five suburban counties surrounding it. about one-third of the slowing occurred in the city -- not ''nearly all.'' (the city accounted for a larger percentage of the slowdown in sales than any of the suburban counties.)"")",2007-10-04,recession

""dumb,"" your gut would say. but wouldn't you like to have taken some profits in july, before the market slid 9 percent? target investors don't consult their gut or their guru when making a move. they just follow the program, selling high and buying low. when do you rebalance? any time one of your asset types--u.s. stocks, international stocks, bonds and so on--grows to 5 percent more than your target allocation, or falls 5 percent below it. like now.being a target player implies that you diversify your investments. for stocks, that means owning at least a broad-based u.s. fund and an international fund. some advisers tell you to forget it--global markets are now so closely tied that their stocks rise and fall virtually in tandem. you might as well own u.s. stocks alone.wrong, says meir statman, finance professor at santa clara university in california. diversification works even in markets that move together because they rise or fall at different rates. the u.s. and international indexes are a good example. the current estimated difference between their returns averages 6.6 percent a year. ""that's a big number,"" statman says. you can't predict which of these markets will earn more (or lose less), so you own both.for more evidence of the value of diversification, look at what's happened since january 2000, when the tech bubble burst. standard &amp; poor's average of 500 leading stocks has risen just 1.63 percent a year, with dividends reinvested, morningstar's mark komissarouk reports. (remember when everyone expected 15 percent?) a diversified portfolio of 60 percent u.s. stocks and 40 percent bonds yielded 3.7 percent. a 50-50 mix of u.s. and international stocks yielded 7.86 percent.it's probably enough to hold 30 percent of your stock investment in internationals, with 70 percent in the united states. nearly half of the s&amp;p companies have major sources of earnings abroad, so, combined, you're probably 50 percent invested in foreign growth. the market has hammered real-estate investment trusts--down 10.7 percent over the past three months. emerging markets are off 4 percent since the end of july. both could drop further. still, under the buy-low rule, they're worth looking at. a reasonable allocation would be 5 percent to each.high-quality bond funds behaved the way they're supposed to. they protected that portion of your money that you'll rely on for future income. safe treasury funds rose. tax exempts lost just a tad.the easiest way to set targets and rebalance is by owning index mutual funds that track the markets you want. for brokerage customers, there are exchange-traded funds that track these markets, too.all of this raises the question--does the credit squeeze in housing point to a ***recession** ahead? the consensus says probably not. consumer spending will slow as fewer families are able to tap home equity for cash, but it won't collapse, says diane swonk, chief economist for mesirow financial. unemployment may rise a bit. but global growth remains strong, the service sector is healthy, manufacturing is improving, core inflation has dropped and businesses have plenty of cash. ""there can be pain in the credit markets with no serious damage to the fundamental economy, as long as the pain doesn't persist,"" says lakshman achuthan, managing director of the economic cycle research institute.but although the first taste of ***financial crisis** may not be followed by ***recession** right away, the seeds are being sown, says allen sinai, chief global economist for decision economics. always diversified, sinai holds u.s. stocks (although he wouldn't touch housing stocks yet). for new money, he prefers asia and the euro zone. ""this isn't america's decade,"" he says.stocks up or stocks down, target investors always have a plan. rebalance now. if you have to do it again at lower prices, so be it. that's a formula that works.",2007-09-10,c("recession", "financial crisis", "recession")

""even if there are layoffs announced, it will take a long time for that to filter into the supply side of the market,"" a broker at cresa partners, robert stella, said.while experts are watching the market turmoil closely, several financial services firms continue to expand or sign new leases. pricewaterhousecoopers, for example, is looking to take the 200,000-square-foot lease at 100 park ave. because it needs more space than its headquarters at 300 madison ave. allows, according to brokers familiar with the situation. national financial partners nearly tripled the size of its office space with the deal at 340 madison ave., and has already subleased 35,160 square feet at its seventh avenue offices to keefe, bruyette &amp; woods, which is also expanding, for an average rent of more than $88 a square foot. in addition, the alliancebernstein expansion doesn't kick in for another three years and runs through 2019, indicating the firm's expectation that it will need additional room for its growth.there are several other deals that have also been signed recently, including peterson management, which has taken nearly 20,000 square feet at 712 fifth ave. at $170 a square foot for the first five years of the lease and $180 a square foot for the remaining five years. at the same fifth avenue building, onex investment corp. renewed its lease for the entire 40th floor, or nearly 10,000 square feet, at $150 a square foot for the first five years and $160 a square foot for the remainder of the 10-year lease. another recent deal is that of ziff brothers investments, which is expanding at 350 park ave. by an additional 60,000 square feet with rents that start at $116 a foot and ramp up by the end of the 13-year lease to $134 a square foot.still, there is a consensus among brokers that rents will not continue their meteoric rise. ""i don't think you are going to see the annual increase in rents as aggressive as it has been over the past 24 months,"" mr. stella said. but with such high rents now, even a drop in real estate prices of 10% will leave most landlords in the black.""even though the current market turmoil has the potential to slow the manhattan economy and the real estate market, the market will not be brought to a standstill or suffer serious long-term harm,"" a report published by cushman &amp; wakefieldlast week concluded.",2007-09-24,market slowdown

""but it is part of a very different picture. the us, europe, and japan will go in one direction, and the developing world will carry on.""and if the emerging markets do keep growing during a developed-world slump, economists note, they could at least cushion the blow for others. they will continue to import the industrial machinery that us and other advanced nations make and will still have an appetite for raw materials such as oil and minerals from the middle east, africa, and latin america.since china, russia, india, and brazil, the main emerging markets, account for only about $6 trillion of gross domestic product (gdp) - compared with $32 trillion in the us, europe, and japan - the developing countries' continued growth can only ""cushion the us decline in a modest way,"" says arthur kroeber, head of the dragonomics economic consultancy in beijing.america still holds the key to much of what happens in the world economy this year, economists say. other countries are already ratcheting down their growth forecasts because of headwinds facing the world's largest consuming nation.falling stock prices a worry at the same time, many financial analysts fear that the subprime ***mortgage crisis** has yet to fully unravel, and that banks worldwide could see their balance sheets weakened, linking much of the global economy in a slowdown.""the strength of emerging economies is in some ways self-sustaining,"" says ed yardeni, president of yardeni research in great neck, n.y. but ""a ***recession** in us could ... interact with the credit crisis to become something really awful.""one sign of worry about global financial ""contagion"" is the performance of stock prices: shares in banks outside the us have fared worse than us banks themselves over the past three months, and stock markets in emerging nations, europe, and japan have all fallen even harder than wall street.when they met in tokyo last weekend, however, finance ministers from the world's largest economies, the group of seven, said ""emerging-market economies are forecast to continue robust, if slower, growth.""developing countries have the edge for a couple of reasons. they are playing catch-up to richer nations, and many of them have benefited from boom times for commodities such as oil. in the process, they have come into their own as global economic forces.from bahrain to brazil, people are busy building bridges, information networks, even whole cities. they are selling goods and services to one another, not just to americans. and they are buying more products than ever from advanced nations - a boon to now-struggling economies like the us.in china, for example, the real engines of growth are not the export factories selling the world clothes and computers, though that visible sector has fueled a $260 billion annual trade surplus. ""the lion's share of chinese gdp growth is domestic, and not a function of the international economy"", says daniel rosen, head of the new york-based china strategic advisory consultancy.past global downturns have not slowed chinaeven if chinese exporters take a hit, previous trade slumps have had practically no ripple effect on the chinese economy, points out mr. kroeber. this time, he predicts, ""there is no question china will lose a little gdp growth in the export sector, but they will gain some back in investment.""china's race to build more roads, railways, homes, and factories contributed most to its 11.4 percent gdp growth last year, and that boom is set to continue, or even gather steam, says kroeber, pointing to official plans to triple investment in railroads this year.even if falling exports of chinese consumer goods to america and europe cut 2 percentage points off last year's growth rate - a common prediction - ""the fact that china is not tanking will be a comfort"" to economic planners elsewhere, says mr. rosen.it will also mean that china will continue to import raw materials and high-technology machinery.

""i'll probably vote for hillary clinton - she's got more experience,"" hasson, 50, said last week. plus, he said, he did not feel comfortable with obama ""after that pastor and stuff,"" referring to anti-white and anti-american remarks by the rev. jeremiah a. wright jr., obama's former minister. the outcome of the april 22 primary will be determined in large measure by how well clinton can retain the support of white working-class men, who have been a key part of her winning coalition in other states - and who support her so far in pennsylvania polls. many voters interviewed in new castle last week said they were comfortable with clinton, a familiar figure whose husband's presidency is remembered fondly. they were less certain of obama. with the exception of the virginia and wisconsin primaries in mid-february, clinton has enjoyed a decisive edge among working-class white men, estimated at nearly a quarter of the nation's electorate. in the last two big-state primaries, on march 4, clinton bested obama among non-college-educated white men by 35 points in ohio and by 20 in texas, according to exit polls.  many democrats, particularly the superdelegates who are expected to decide the nomination, are keeping an anxious eye on the trends, because working-class white voters could be crucial in battleground states in the general election, and the candidate able to win them could be the stronger nominee. blue-collar men, the key to franklin d. roosevelt's new deal coalition, became ""reagan democrats"" in the 1980s, putting republican ronald reagan in the white house. bill clinton won them back in 1992, but two years later they were the ""angry white males"" who gave the gop control of congress. ""the blue-collar vote has been up for grabs for 30 years, and it is the bulk of the democratic base in pennsylvania,"" said james lee, president of susquehanna polling &amp; research in harrisburg. his polls and surveys by other organizations have found clinton leading by double digits in pennsylvania, in part because of her advantage among white working-class men. analysts say that, so far, obama's core message of a ""new politics"" has not resonated as much with working-class voters as clinton's focus on economic issues such as job losses due to foreign trade and the high cost of health care. ""some of it is familiarity with her,"" said mike young, a pollster in hershey. ""the unknown is to what extent is there a racial component to his problems with white working-class voters."" obama started a six-day bus tour of pennsylvania on friday aimed at introducing himself. he has been talking more about economic policy, and his tv ads in the state use blue-collar imagery. new castle, a shrunken steel town of 26,000 about an hour northwest of pittsburgh, is as good a place as any to gauge the task obama faces. though it's home to the famous zambelli fireworks manufacturing co., health care is now the main industry, and concern about the ***economic downturn** runs high. a handful of democrats said they preferred neither clinton nor obama and probably would vote for republican sen. john mccain in the fall.

""i don't care for him - i think he's arrogant,"" said vito yeropoli, 34, an account manager with a wireless-phone company. ""i like hillary. when you ask her a question about a problem, you get a plan. she'll give some kind of a solution.""  obama, he said, talks theoretically. yeropoli also was put off by wright's comments, which he called ""hate speech."" john paolone slid into a corner booth at hudson's presided over by richard christopher, a former mayor and current democratic county chairman.

""i was a die-hard democrat until reagan."" jim krawchyk, who became a truck driver after retiring as a steelworker six years ago, said he would vote for a republican presidential candidate for the first time this fall and considered mccain a war hero.

located in the olympic village shopping center -- that is, until the shopping center underwent renovations in 1991 and carter had to move his store.he then set up shop in a converted one-room house on judson street, where the record store has stood for 17 years.but times -- and business -- are changing, and carter's cds aren't selling too well these days.\""it started to slack in june,\"" he said about recent sales. \""christmas was bad, and after christmas, it was really slack.\""carter said this holiday season was the store's worst in 20 years. sales were down 30 percent in january and weren't showing any sign of picking up.carter decided to try something he'd never done before: he put his merchandise on sale.in january, carter marked down everything in his store, from 10 to 50 percent off. he hung a giant yellow banner in front of sounds great announcing the sale, and he posted a sign in the window proclaiming that \""88 cent cds\"" were available.since carter already sells new cds at 10 to 15 percent below suggested retail price, the additional discount significantly cut the price of his wares.and it made a difference.business improved once the sale started, with carter bringing in hundreds more dollars per day.\""the sale really helped,\"" he said. \""business perked right up.\""any increase in business is good news for carter, since this holiday slump is just one the financial troubles sounds great has seen recently.for the past few years, the store's profits have been steadily declining. carter has been ordering less and less merchandise every week, and he stopped offering customers trade credit for used cds.\""i needed the cash flow,\"" he said about why he stopped letting shoppers trade in used cds for new ones.as for why his business has declined, carter offers a few reasons. for one, he says his customer base consists of 35 to 50 regular customers who buy classic and alternative rock albums.his customers are loyal -- some who shopped at sounds great decades ago as teenagers now bring in their own children to buy music -- but his customer base has not grown much.the clearance sale, however, brought in several new customers.one woman wandered into sounds great after seeing the sale signs out front and told carter she had lived in gig harbor for 17 years but had never set foot in his store.what impressed that woman, carter said, was sounds great's selection.\""she usually shopped at borders,\"" carter said. \""but she said she saw 100 titles here she had never seen before.\""carter shrugs off concerns that bigger stores at uptown gig harbor and gig harbor north are affecting his business. he prides himself on stocking music that target or borders -- the two newest stores in town to sell cds -- would \""never bother with.\""he believes small, locally-owned businesses in gig harbor are generally having difficulty making ends meet these days, partially for individual reasons.for example, he cites the effect of digital music downloading through online stores like itunes as affecting cd sales.but he also thinks a possible ***recession** and other factors such as high gas prices affect shipping costs for retailers, and rising rent prices in town are also to blame.warren zimmerman, executive director at the gig harbor chamber of commerce, disagrees with carter. he said he doubts there are universally declining sales among local business owners but thinks that added competition is a big factor in the harbor's economy.\""i don't think it's a trend,\"" zimmerman said. \""i think that competition has gotten much greater. i think there are some businesses that will not find it as easy to exist as previously.\""but there are no hard-and-fast details about how many businesses have opened or closed in gig harbor over the past few years.zimmerman said the chamber tracks membership, but membership isn't an indicator of whether a business is just starting up or shutting down, since businesses can join or rescind their membership in the chamber of commerce at any time.\""there is no magic gage to see how gig harbor is doing today,\"" he said.based on the city of gig harbor's data, the number of business licenses issued within the city has increased dramatically over the past year.in 2006, there were 299 licenses issued, which, according to executive assistant laurelyn brekke, \""is a bit of a pick-up\"" from the 253 licenses issued in 2005.this year, that number more than doubled to 618 new licenses.brekke said the number of licenses does not indicate how many businesses have opened in town, since it also includes contractors working consistently within city limits who are required to have gig harbor business licenses.but the addition of new contractors means more development and more buildings, and more buildings means more businesses down the line.just like the chamber, the city can't say how many businesses have closed in gig harbor during the past year, since businesses are not required to turn their business licenses back in if they go under.\""there's no real way to track that,\"" brekke said about how many businesses are closing in the area. \""many of them don't close their business license.\""holding a sale was one step carter took to avoid closing or moving sounds great. the last time business slumped for carter, he considered leaving gig harbor and moving to a higher-traffic location in tacoma.\""when it first started to slack off in the early 2000s, i thought about moving to the proctor district,\"" he said.the space carter hoped to lease didn't work out -- another business signed a lease and moved into the building before he could -- and he stayed on judson street.since then, he's entertained the notion of moving his business to uptown gig harbor, but he said he doubts he could afford it. the rent at his current location, which is owned by the tarabochia family, has remained consistently low.\""the tarabochias have been incredible in keeping my rent affordable,\"" carter said.a new space would mean higher rent -- carter predicts \""three to four times what i pay now\"" -- which would require that keeping sounds great open longer hours to make more money.that would lead to hiring more employees, since carter is currently the only person who works in the store.all those changes would have a financial impact.\""i would be in the same boat,\"" carter said.zimmerman said there are options for struggling businesses that are members of the chamber, like business coaching.the chamber can link businesses having trouble with other professionals who are successful and can provide recommendations.while zimmerman said that sort of partnership does not happen often in gig harbor, he added that the chamber would help make it happen, if it were requested.he also said there are any numbers of factors that contribute to failing businesses, from management to the quality of employees or actual sales. that makes it difficult to point to any particular trends in gig harbor that may cause businesses to struggle, and therefore, it's practically impossible to form a blanket solution.but zimmerman did have one piece of advice: \""you've got to meet the demands of the customer you're trying to serve,\"" he said.carter has no immediate plans to close sounds great, thanks to the success of his sale. he recognizes that gig harbor is changing, but said he \""does not know what is going to happen\"" to the town's business as a whole.for now, he said he plans to keep running his store the way he always has: by stocking the music his customers want to hear.\""people need music,\"" he said. \""they're going to buy music no matter what.\""gig harbor business licensesaccording to the city of gig harbor, the numbers of business licenses have increased steadily with each passing year.--in 2005, 253 licenses were issued.--in 2006, the number increased to 299.--last year, it doubled to 618.reach lifestyles coordinator

""we don't have an official [government-relations] practice,"" said arthur makadon, chairman of ballard spahr. ""we have a lot of people who have done various things for various clients in various parts of the country, and this will bring that under one umbrella, launching a national government-relations practice that focuses on statewide issues."" estey's move to ballard spahr illustrates the pressing need - and sharp competition - among large law firms to recruit top lawyers with substantial contacts. when firms land top names, it usually makes news. as a general rule, state employees in pennsylvania face a one-year post-employment restriction on lobbying government agencies for which they had worked. but since the pennsylvania supreme court exempted lawyers from that ban on the grounds that the court alone had authority to regulate lawyer conduct, estey would be legally permitted to approach the governor's office on policy matters. but estey said he would not lobby his former employer. ""i just don't think it would be appropriate, given the work i have done and the level of my relationship with the governor."" there is little doubt that estey is close with rendell. ""john estey performed superbly for five years as my chief of staff,"" rendell said in a statement on estey's departure. although he worked for a democratic administration, he seems to have maintained good relations with republicans in harrisburg. steve macnett, general counsel to the senate republicans, said that while estey was intensely focused on rendell's agenda, he had a practical side. his credibility with rendell sometimes helped to move the governor toward compromise, macnett said. ""he's a real pro,"" he said of estey. ""we had some issues where we got our backs up, but i found him to be a complete professional, a rational and intelligent guy."" makadon said the new practice group would initially comprise about a dozen lawyers, with a handful of those working on government matters full time. the aim, makadon said, is to help corporate clients coordinate legal and regulatory strategies in multiple state capitals at the same time. the idea is that regulatory initiatives often play out in many state capitals simultaneously, as they did when the states began cracking down on tobacco in the 1990s, or when state banking laws were restructured across the country in the 1980s. makadon said the firm believed that offering corporate clients a coordinated strategy, along with estey's policy experience, would produce healthy returns, even in the event of an ***economic downturn**. ""this is a ***recession**-proof practice,"" makadon said. ""it doesn't depend on the economy, it doesn't depend on lending. there are always going to be businesses that need to deal with state-related issues."" estey, a graduate of carleton college and the university of pittsburgh law school, had been a partner at ballard spahr for a year before leaving in january 2003 to join the rendell administration as chief of staff. rendell and estey go back a ways. estey had earlier been rendell's deputy chief of staff from july 1997 through march 1999, when rendell was mayor of philadelphia. estey, who lives in ardmore, said the increasing complexity of state governments around the country was creating pressures on corporate clients to stay ahead of the regulatory and legislative curve. one practice area that is likely to grow is law that centers on sale of government assets, such as roadways, already widespread, and the establishment of partnerships between state governments and private-sector interests to develop commuter rail lines and other services, he said. ""a lot of folks are looking at that aggressively,"" he said of the public-private partnerships. contact staff writer chris mondics at 215-854-5957 or cmondics@phillynews.com.

can i pay for it with cash?\""if you answer \""no\"" to either question, skip the purchase. ideally, use credit as you would cash, only when you know you can pay the bill off on time and in full.-- create a repayment plan. look at your credit card debt and make a plan to pay off balances.make at least minimum payments on all cards to avoid penalties, and prioritize the order for paying them off.pay any small balances in full, then work on accounts with the highest interest rate.-- pay more than the minimum. with minimum payments, you could pay three times the original purchase price when interest and other charges are added in.use bonuses or other unexpected gifts to reduce your balances.-- keep track of your bills. designate a filing cabinet or secured box for bills and financial statements.make separate files for bank statements, tax documents, credit card bills, medical receipts, mortgage statements and other records. keep up with due dates.-- prioritize your expenses and spending. divide them into \""needs\"" and \""wants.\"" set spending limits and estimate costs for each. if any funds are left over after monthly expenses are paid, split them between debt reduction and savings.-- take action and get help. if you know you are going to have problems making payments, contact your creditors to explain your situation and what you're doing to meet your debt obligations.you may be able to negotiate the amount of your next payment or interest rate. remember, creditors would rather keep you as a customer than lose you to bankruptcy or foreclosure.you can also work with a certified credit counselor who will help you assess your situation and help you develop a plan of action.for information on local chapters of debtors anonymous, go to njpada.org. meetings are at st. mark's episcopal church in teaneck at 4 p.m. each sunday (201-344-8313) and st. paul's lutheran church in teaneck at 7:30 p.m. on friday (201-833-5592).for information on the new jersey cccs, go to cccsnj.org or call 888-726-3260.e-mail: demarrais@northjersey.comto see more of the record, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.northjersey.com. copyright (c) 2008, the record, hackensack, n.j. distributed by mcclatchy-tribune information services. for reprints, email tmsreprints@permissionsgroup.com, call 800-374-7985 or 847-635-6550, send a fax to 847-635-6968, or write to the permissions group inc., 1247 milwaukee ave., suite 303, glenview, il 60025, usa."",

"137","4RRW-NC90-TWKH-F0VC-00000-00.txt","in his final state of the union speech monday night, president george w. bush once again reminded the u.s. public of the cornerstone of his administration's foreign policy: 'we trust that people, when given a chance, will choose a future of freedom and peace.'he cited, as evidence, 'stirring images' of liberty from around the middle east: lebanese taking to the streets, afghans emerging from the tyranny of the taliban, and 'jubilant' iraqis holding up ink-stained index fingers. but in the last seven years, washington's pursuit of democracy promotion in the region has been eclipsed by the 'war on terror'.as the president drifts further into irrelevance -- repeating the rationale for a disastrous iraq war and framing the struggle for political liberty in the middle east as a battle against radical islamic terrorism -- his regional allies have increasingly eschewed washington's calls for political reform.'whether the u.s. was interested in democracy promotion or not, it came to halting end at the end of 2005 and 2006,' said samer shehata, a political science professor at georgetown university.citing the electoral experiences of the egyptian muslim brotherhood and palestinian hamas, as well as the hezbollah-israel war, he said: 'after that period, many in washington were saying that [egyptian] president mubarak looked very good compared to [hassan] nassrallah.'for citizens of morocco, egypt, jordan, lebanon, saudi arabia, and kuwait, the path to political reform remains obscured. and as their societies grow and advance, there is little evidence to suggest that their leaders have any intention of shifting the status quo or to truly 'democratise' their states, according to the authors of a new book examining the region's chequered history.'society and economic systems have changed at a very rapid pace and the political systems have not. there is a feeling that the region is out of synch, not only with the rest of the world. they are out of synch with themselves. something has to change,' said marina s. ottaway, who edited 'beyond the façade: political reform in the arab world'.arab leaders may wish to compare themselves to the 'enlightened monarchs' of 18th century europe, but their 'top down' approaches to reform -- a vision that begins with the idea of modernising the economy, and culminating in political democratisation -- offer cosmetic changes at best. in the absence of institutions, local councils, and parliaments that have the procedural ability to check executive power, it appears the arab regimes are simply 'paying lip service to the idea of political reform,' according to ottaway, who also heads the middle east programme at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace.either the recent developments reflect a nascent political opening, a 'planting of seeds' that may later yield a democratic bounty, she said, or 'these countries are simply finding ways to blow off a little steam, to provide the illusion of political participation, and a way to earn some brownie points with the international community.'arab leaders are familiar with the language of democracy: calls for reform emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s as many arab regimes dealt with acute ***economic crisis** brought on by massive budgetary deficits and external debts. structural adjustment programmes, initiated by international lenders such as the international monetary fund, provided highly conditioned loans. regimes had to privatise inefficient public sectors, change budgetary patterns, and cut subsidies, all of which threatened to shift the economic arrangements of elites.but economic reform does not necessarily translate into political opening.'there is no solid evidence that economic growth leads to democracy, or that economic liberalisation leading to economic growth,' said julia choucair-vizoso, an associate at the carnegie endowment who co-edited 'beyond the façade'.in the case of egypt, privatisation schemes during the 1990s often served to rearrange elite networks already in place, not bolster economic benefits for lower or middle classes.choucair-vizoso said that there exist few pro-democracy ngos in the region; they are often co-opted by the state, fragmented, remain heavily dependent on foreign funds, and tend to exhibit a lack of 'internal democracy'. as such, civil society has not emerged as a key actor to promote change.for arab states to move towards democracy, she said, the pressure for change will have to come from domestic political entities outside the ruling elites. secular parties remain weak and divided, and due to structural conditions of the system, they have limited space to manoeuvre.'secular parties have been plagued by internal schisms and a failure to articulate a coherent agenda or vision,' said choucair-vizoso.the most effective opposition to these authoritarian regimes instead comes from islamist movements, much to the displeasure of most u.s.-based democracy advocates.'it is impossible to think about democratisation in the middle east without thinking about islamists in some way or another,' said shehata.in contrast to secular parties, islamists retain strong organisational cohesion, and can circumvent certain legal conditions for meeting, including through robust social welfare networks, schools, and the mosque.'if you go and talk to the representatives of political parties in the arab world, secular parties often have their offices in the downtown area, in the business district. the islamists have theirs in poor districts, in slums,' said ottaway.

""the fed figured that out just recently,"" he says. considering the freeze in the commercial-paper market last summer, the central bank opened up its credit windows to investment banks almost ""a year too late,"" he says.as a result, packages of business loans, known as collateralized loan obligations, that sold on wall street at full face value last july had lost nearly 20 percent of their value by january - ""a pure consequence of hysteria,"" mr. feiger says.what the fed should do when it rescues an investment bank from bankruptcy, feiger proposes, is act like a hedge fund: take half the increase in the firm's value as a result of its action. in the case of bear stearns, that would have given the fed $500 million. shareholders would split the remaining $500 million.so far, the fed has taken some $400 billion in collateral from various banks by propping up the nation's financial system with loans. unless financial markets calm down suddenly and unexpectedly, it will pile up as much as $2 trillion in collateral before it is over, feiger predicts. and the fed may not lose ""one penny"" on these rescues, he says, since the collateral has real value.(c) copyright 2008. the christian science monitor",2008-03-31,c("recession", "financial crisis", "financial crisis")

allowed the county to offset slumping home prices and weak retail spending.and the county's diverse economy is tempering job loss tied to the housing and mortgage-lending crises in neighboring orange and riverside counties, said the reports, which studied foreign investment and international trade in southern california.\""i think l.a. is weathering the storm fairly well given what's happening

the year, a modest job loss of about 2,000 jobs or so, which isn't anything particularly great, but when you look at what's happening in detroit, st. louis, even las vegas, which has been hit hard by the housing slowdown, it's not too devastating.\""the reports are being presented today at a long beach forum, where mayor bob foster and long beach harbor commissioner jim hankla will be joined by business leaders from around the southland.one survey, an annual booklet titled \""international trade trends and impacts,\"" looked at foreign trade, which is responsible for roughly 30,000 jobs in long beach and several billion dollars in wages to residents around san pedro bay.although import volumes are likely to remain flat through the year, the export boom of american-made products will continue as long as the u.s. dollar remains competitive in foreign markets, kyser said.that, in turn, will help stabilize manufacturing employment in the southland, home to the nation's largest manufacturing base and a gateway for california's agricultural exports, authors said.foreign sales of higher-end products like wine, cheese and nuts are experiencing double-digit growth, and a recent surge in rice and cotton prices has boosted revenue and production in the north.many of those products are shipped through the neighboring long beach and los angeles port complex, the nation's busiest.the total value of imports and exports through the los angeles customs district is forecast to reach $365.7 billion, up 4.7 percent from last year, the study by the los angeles county economic development corp. says.the largest portion of the customs district traffic goes through the ports of los angeles and long beach, as well as lax.the two ports will see a paltry 1 percent annual increase in loaded container traffic this year, to a combined 15.8 million 20-foot equivalent containers, the study forecasts.\""we're used to 10-percent-a-year growth in container traffic,\"" kyser said. \""we didn't get that last year. we won't get that this year. the question is, will it recover next year?\""the slow growth is due to a major slump in imports, which are forecast to post a meager 0.2 percent rise in loaded container traffic this year at the two main ports.that contrasts with an impressive 15.6 percent rise in exported loaded containers predicted for this year.manufacturers of heavy machinery, televisions, computers and other high-end electronics are benefitting in the export boom, as consumers and businesses in asia snap up more and more of these products from california producers, kyser said.\""there's a myth that all our exports are low-end, low-value stuff,\"" kyser said.kyser expects better things next year.\""overall in 2008, with imports (flat) and exports up, there's going to be a modest uptick (in trade), but the big question is what the christmas of 2008 will look like,\"" kyser said. \""(2009) will probably see more pickup.\""he credits new marine terminal development in the port of los angeles and peaceful labor negotiations between longshoremen and dock bosses for easing diversion fears, which many expected to exacerbate slumping import volumes.in addition, the port of los angeles was the nation's top individual port last year, with trade valued at $241.6 billion, up 7.8 percent from the year before.the port of long beach ranked eighth with trade valued at $87.4 billion, up 2.8 percent. lax was no. 11, with $81.3 billion, up 2.6 percent.the port of long beach was no. 2 nationwide in container traffic last year, with a 4.1 percent gain.growth of imports through southern california from asia measured in the double-digits annually for several years, but took a steep dive last year as consumers cut back on spending and housing fell off.in other areas, the economy is expected to benefit this year from renewed television and film production, which suffered early in the year from a 100-day strike by writers.the entertainment industry, one of the region's largest employers, has ramped up production significantly in recent weeks in preparation for the fall season.in long beach, recent productions include \""criminal minds,\"" \""csi: miami\"" and \""dexter.\"" work on the adam sandler feature film \""bedtime stories\"" was also wrapped up here recently.also boosting the local economy is foreign investment, which has been buoyed in part by the weak dollar, international trade and film production.a survey by the laedc and world trade center of long beach-los angeles reveals more than 2,000 foreign-owned businesses in long beach, los angeles and torrance, many with ties to seaports, airports, banks, warehouses and hollywood.specifically, 1,633 such businesses are in l.a., while 309 are in torrance and 211 are in long beach, noted co-author nancy sidhu of the kyser center for economic research.using economic figures, surveys and trends, the 44-page report predicts increased investment by foreign companies looking to establish trade offices, manufacturing bases, shipping operations and other outposts in southern california.topping the list of foreign investment in the southland are firms from the united kingdom, japan, france, germany and china, who are using favorable exchange rates to boost their presence here.\""basically, the u.s. is on sale, and there is a lot

""britain just feels like a completely different country from 1992,"" says adrian cooper of oxford economics. ""this is now a world-leading, dynamic place in a way that it never was before.""no one who's visited london in the past decade could doubt it--$10 lattes, $2 million studio flats and oligarchs escorting supermodels abound. but britain's prosperity has expanded far beyond its glitzy expatriate-packed capital. many northern cities are booming, and the middle class throughout the nation spends in a way that would have shocked their postwar predecessors. british motorists now buy more mercedeses and bmws per head than americans. handbag sales are up 146 percent since 2002. in the past four years, spending on long-haul holidays to the caribbean and the united states has risen more than 40 percent. spending on restaurants is up 18 percent since 2002.the plain truth is that the once frugal british consumer is enjoying the fruits of an economy that's seen consistent growth for a record 15 years. thanks go in large part to the city. during the past three years, a sector worth 10 percent of the economy has contributed 30 percent of gdp growth. london is now arguably the world's most global financial capital.but simple comparisons deceive. more average britons remodel their kitchens and wear $200 jeans than ever before, but their pleasure is built at least in part on a greater willingness to access easy credit. ""the fact is that it's easy enough to have a high standard of living if you are willing to borrow,"" says daniel gros of the brussels-based centre for european policy studies. as in america, household debt in britain is now running at a record high, with the spendthrift brits actually edging ahead, thanks in large measure to the rocketing house prices of recent years.of course, the dollar's weakness seriously distorts the picture. the american shopper still enjoys a hefty advantage over the british when it comes to how much his greenback will buy. according to figures from the international monetary fund, the average briton was barely ahead of european neighbors in terms of purchasing power, and trailed americans by more than $7,000 last year. everyday prices in britain are now scarily high, as demand races ahead of supply. think too of labor and land costs in crowded cities. michael saunders, an economist at citibank in london, says, ""in the short term, we 'british' may be rich, but only if we go to new york to do our shopping.""the picture of living standards is also skewed by the relative benefits of the welfare state. ""because purchasing-power figures tally mainly market prices, they probably underestimate the standard of living in france and germany, where you don't have to pay for a lot of the services, like health or education, that you need to buy in the u.s.,"" says john schmidt of the center for economic and policy research in washington. higher earnings in britain or america are often bought through extra time at the treadmill; workers probably put in at least three hours a week more than french or german equivalents. no wonder they need all that champagne.

""they may not see that in the upfront but they may be a little concerned about scatter. they should be pricing their inventory in the upfront to move.""even though the ***recession** is a factor in this year's upfronts, there's one issue that won't be. last year saw a move to commercial live-plus-three-day viewing becoming the main currency after decades of live-only program ratings. with only a year of c3 under their belts, there's little appetite for wholesale change. there will be deals done with minute-by-minute ratings, but those are likely to be the exception, not the rule.""we have to have some history under our belt before we go to the next metric, whatever that may be,"" one buyer said.

""it may very well be the middle of 2009 before we see a housing market that starts to look `normal,' "" ratcliff and gin wrote.* the office market in san diego county will remain weak, with few new projects through 2010. ucla economist jerry nickelsburg wrote that the boom in office space that began in san diego county in early 2006 put too much supply onto the market. he predicted that lower growth in demand would result in lower rental rates and more vacancies.* rising fuel prices could cut into tourism to san diego county at a time when new hotel rooms have just come onto the market. the increased supply of rooms and softening demand from visitors could spell trouble for the regional tourism industry.though those predictions sound bad enough, they could easily get worse, ratcliff said. the forecast assumes that the rate of foreclosures, government budget cuts and gasoline prices will not rise much beyond their current trends.""we're already forecasting things to be bad, but they could get worse,"" ratcliff said. ""a further spike in energy prices is one of the downside risks that we could be facing. or if there are significant government job losses this year instead of 2009, which is already reflected in our forecast.""ratcliff does not see much chance that the economy will do better than the forecast. he said the recent stimulus package coming out of washington -- which includes a multibillion-dollar corporate tax credit -- won't have any major effect on the economy.""there's no silver bullet here,"" he said. ""tax credits help a little at the margins, but they don't change the fundamentals of the economy. i don't think any of the policies (being discussed in washington) will make a big difference, although they could make things a little less painful than they would have been otherwise.""kelly cunningham, economist at the san diego institute for policy research, agreed with the thrust of the ucla report.

""we're still losing jobs in construction and real estate, although we're adding jobs in other sectors -- such as high-tech, health care and tourism.""marney cox, economist at the san diego association of governments, said that if employment were to decline for two quarters -- as the ucla report suggests -- he would expect an unemployment rate of 5.8 percent or 6 percent. but instead, he expects a high of 5.5 percent, thanks to summertime employment.""we're coming into the time when san diego's visitor industry really begins to add people,"" he said.

co., ltd., a cpa firm in providence.edward m. mazze, former dean of the university of rhode island s college of business administration, said that the start of the rebate distribution  is going to help raise people s confidence in the government s ability to follow through on something that s been promised, and also do something to stimulate the economy. while everybody s talking, the government is actually doing something. mazze, who currently serves as distinguished university professor of business administration at uri, said,  rhode island is definitely in a ***recession**,  and many other parts of the country are in the similar economic circumstances, with rising unemployment rates and a drop in confidence by business people and consumers. people are really living so close to the edge now, [mainly] because of the rising price of gasoline. the [rebate] money is going to immediately help,  and will also spur economic activity -- no matter if people spend their rebate money, invest it or use it to pay bills, mazze said.keep in mind that the treasury still plans to issue rebates by direct deposit first, paper checks later.so, as a general rule, if you filled out the  direct deposit  section of your federal income-tax return, you should receive your rebate by direct deposit, too -- and get it sooner than those who ll receive rebate checks by mail.president bush late last week announced that some rebates will be issued earlier than planned.the treasury followed up with yesterday s first round of directly deposited rebates, riley said. the simpler returns were processed through a more modernized computer system, so it speeded up the processing, and we were able to get the [rebates] out quicker,  riley said yesterday.the irs is still sticking with its originally published schedule for rebate distributions. the irs also says that rebates will continue to be distributed based on the last two digits of your social security number.but the irs now says, in effect, that the dates in that schedule are at the extreme end of the range. as a result, you could receive your rebate earlier.for example, the treasury originally planned to start mailing rebate checks on may 16. so if the last two digits of your social security number are between 00 and 09, your rebate check wasn t supposed to be in the mail before may 16.but the irs now says that rebate checks for some of the people with those social security numbers will be mailed may 9, and that all of the checks for people with those social security numbers will be mailed by may 16.in general, rebates will range from $600 to $1,200 if you re married and filing a joint return, or $300 to $600 if you used another  filing status  on your federal income-tax return (such as  single  or  head of household ).you may be eligible for an additional rebate amount of up to $300 for each child you have who was under 17 as of dec. 31, 2007.(the rebate schedule described above applies to people who filed their federal income-tax returns by april 15 and who are eligible for a rebate. if you re eligible for a rebate but file or filed after april 15, you ll receive your rebate later this year.)today s tip: the irs still plans to mail you an individualized notice which will let you know, based on your circumstances, how much you ll receive and when you can expect to receive it.but because some rebates are being issued earlier than planned, some people will receive their rebates before they receive their notices, riley said.keep the notice in your tax files; you ll need it early next year, when you complete your 2008 federal income-tax return, she said.to hear recorded messages about the federal rebate program and its rules, call the irs s rebate hotline toll-free at 1-866-234-2942. you can also find out more about the rebate program from the irs web site:www.irs.gov",2008-04-29,recession

""ubs also continued the fraud after they knew the fraud was revealed for what it was after the auctions were failing they continued to sell the securities.""the civil suit seeks to force the swiss bank to buy back ars from its customers across the nation at par. ubs customers currently hold more than $25 billion of illiquid ars, cuomo said. the case is not limited to new york, he said.""we believe we have nationwide jurisdiction and we're looking for recoveries not just on behalf of one state but nationwide,"" he said.ubs spokeswoman karina byrne said in a statement that the firm would ""vigorously"" defend itself in the case and that the bank had acted in the best interest of its clients.""ubs categorically rejects any claim that the firm engaged in a widespread campaign to move ars inventory from the firm's own books and into private client accounts,"" she said. ""ubs has dedicated significant resources and substantial effort to find solutions for its clients in this unprecedented ars ***market crisis**.""the spokeswoman said that ubs had been fully engaged in good faith negotiations with cuomo's office to bring liquidity to its clients holding ars. while certain individuals exercised poor judgment, their actions were not illegal, she said.the suit alleges that ubs became aware of disruptions in the ars market in august 2007 when three auctions it managed failed. the firm began to take on more inventory to support its auction, surpassing its $2.1 billion cap for ars, according to the suit.the bank had to repeatedly raise its inventory cap as investors began leaving ars and it had to buy more securities to support the auctions. by december 31, the bank held approximately $6.2 billion of ars. a week before the ars market froze up in february 2008, ubs' inventory had risen to $10.5 billion, according to the suit. on february 13, ubs stopped supporting its auctions and they began to fail.while this was going on, ubs had ramped up its efforts to market the securities to retail investors even as internally it was expressing concern about risks. individual investors received account statements from ubs that identified their ars as ""cash alternatives"" and some did not know they held ars until the market collapsed in mid-february and their statements began to list ""auction rate securities"", the suit alleges.a trading desk manager in december 2007 raised the possibility of widespread auction failures, according to an e-mail included in the suit.""this forces the hand of every broker-dealer in the auction market to decide between supporting deals, taking inventories or at levels far below market rates or failing auctions (not supporting) which triggers a chain reaction of selling across all auction products ... mark to market losses would be significant to all parties involved.""in 2006 the securities and exchange commission sanctioned 15 firms for faulty ars disclosures, though ubs was not one of them, after the commission investigated broker-dealer ars practices.the fact that ubs was not one of the firms sanctioned has led some market participants to wonder why. a bond attorney in washington with knowledge of the situation said that ""it would not be wrong"" to assume that ubs may have been one of the first firms to alert the sec to problems in the ars market and was treated with leniency.sec and ubs officials have declined to comment on this issue.under the terms of the 2006 sec settlement, 15 firms agreed to pay more than $13 million in penalties to settle securities law violations for engaging in practices like bidding in auctions that were never disclosed as a possibility in offering documents.the settlement was unusual because it started with the commission asking firms to voluntarily provide information about their ars programs and it differs from the ubs lawsuits because it focused on disclosures about the firms' auction programs and practices, not their sales practices for selling ars.still, the suits come less than two years after the sec sanctions and if the details in the new york and massachusettsubs suits are reflective of industry-wide behavior, future law suits by other states investigating auction-rate securities may reveal a widespread disconnect between what was going on within firms and what broker-dealers were disclosing.cuomo's suit, unlike galvin's, does not name individual ubs bankers by name, but it does provide fresh details on the value of

suit, an e-mail from ubs's chief risk officer on dec. 12, 2007 states that ars were ""experiencing digestion problems"" and that each product has ""potential trouble."" an unnamed executive who was copied on the e-mail instructed his personal financial advisor to get him out of ars. within four days all of the executive's $250,000 of ars had been sold. other executives liquidated millions of their ars.""by failing to disclose market disruptions that were occurring while it was allowing its senior executive to reduce or eliminate their personal auction rate securities holdings, ubs

deals with investors, investor protection bureau chief david markowitz said that the office could seek remedies for issuers of ars as well.the filing of the suit follows news on wednesday that the state of texas is considering suspending ubs ag's broker dealer and financial services license. a september hearing will consider whether the bank misrepresented and failed to disclose information about the liquidity and risks of the ars market.among several revelations in the massachusettsubs suit is how reluctant officials at the firm were to continue to support the ars market.""i don't want to service this product either - quite frankly and am happy to responsibly dispose of it - we are trying for sure,"" wrote david shulman, global head of the firm's municipal securities group and head of fixed income, according to the massachusetts suit.shulman, who was responsible for pitching the securities to so-called wealth management, or retail clients, began to sell his personal stake in ars in august and converted his investments to variable-rate demand obligations. by december he had liquidated his holdings, and told galvin's investigators that he began selling them because of his lack

""our last show of the season opened literally as the banks were going under and (the government was) seizing everything.""we estimated the drop in attendance lost us $70,000. people were staying home, gas was astronomically expensive. people were waiting to see what would happen to their 401(k)s and everything else.""as a result, the company likely will shorten its season and focus more tightly on shows that appeal to the whole family.""from every angle of our operation, we're looking at, `what's plan b?'

"154","4TRC-K2N0-TX2J-205S-00000-00.txt","point of viewover the past few weeks, some silly ideas have circulated on the impact of the ***financial crisis** on latin america. the most dangerous was that latin america would be largely impervious to a debacle that was, as brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva imprudently phrased it, ""bush's crisis."" leaders ranging from mexico's felipe calderón on the center-right to fidel castro and hugo chávez on the extreme left all claimed, for different reasons, that orthodox macroeconomic policies, recent growth, solid banking systems, the high price of commodities (oil, soybeans, copper, iron, coal) and tighter market regulation and supervision would help spare the latin economies from the woes of their partners across the rio grande, the atlantic and the pacific. or, in their more excessive moments, castro, chávez and a few others (on occasion, argentina's cristina fernández de kirchner) gloated over the demise (finally) of the capitalist system, from which socialist countries like theirs would emerge in better shape than others.well, the brazilian real has dropped 30 percent from its august high and the sã£o paulo stock exchange has fallen 45 percent since the end of june. the mexican peso has fallen 30 percent against the dollar since mid-september, and the local stock exchange has collapsed. commodity prices, which through direct ownership (mexico, venezuela, ecuador, colombia, chile) or taxation (argentina, bolivia) provide huge shares of government revenues, have dropped sharply. growth forecasts for the last quarter of 2008, and mainly for next year, have been cut dramatically. so much for the idea of latin immunity from contagion.it was always naive, even deceitful, for these experts and rulers to maintain that the region would be cushioned from the effects of the crisis. while many latin banks do not depend as much on foreign credit and thus are less vulnerable to the credit crunch than richer nations, suppliers' credits are key for exports, foreign loans are crucial for infrastructure projects and foreign investment remains important for many economies (mexico, brazil, colombia, peru). since much of the impressive recent growth has been commodity driven, the fall in prices can be devastating for countries like peru, venezuela, ecuador and argentina.even brazil, which has the region's most diversified and sophisticated export base, is also an enormous producer of food exports and minerals and is being shaken by falling-hard currency earnings. the country that is perhaps the least sensitive to commodity prices--mexico, because of the large volume of its manufacturing sales abroad--is the most sensitive to the swings and lurches of the u.s. economy, since 90 percent of its exports and tourism, and 100 percent of its remittances, are american-based.another unnoticed vulnerability is that, as latin economies globalized over the past two decades, the number of local companies listed in new york rose rapidly. thirty-eight brazilian companies are quoted on wall street; 20 mexican ones are; 15 chilean; and a growing number of peruvian, colombian and argentine corporations are too. they all represent large proportions of the market capitalization in their own home exchanges (telmex alone accounts for nearly 50 percent of the mexican bolsa's trading), and they all track the dow with great fidelity.if the dow plunges, their value follows in new york, the fall spreads to sã£o paulo, and so on, and local investors flee the local exchanges and buy what the rich in latin america have always bought: dollars. the currency plummets, central banks raise interest rates to retain money at home, and a domestic debt bubble bursts: mortgages, automobile loans and credit-card balances become unsustainable. all of this is beginning to happen, and will probably get worse before it improves.this is a stark reminder of how contagion works. one of the other silly ideas about the fallout was that in the past, crises began in latin america and spread north, making this year a very new scenario. not so. it was paul volcker's 1980 decision to raise interest rates that led, two years on, to the latin debt crisis, which never really affected the creditor countries. the 1987 stock-market collapse began on wall street, spread to mexico and throughout latin america, but never returned; finally, the mexican collapse of 1994-95, as well as the brazilian devaluation of 1997, occurred during one of the longest economic booms in modern u.s. history. all crises that begin in the rich countries spread south; those that originate in the south rarely travel north.some countries will emerge from the current crisis better than others. mexico, chile, brazil and uruguay should manage just fine, with only bruises and scrapes; others will weather the storm, though suffering greater harm (colombia, peru). but others will incur severe damage: venezuela, bolivia, ecuador, central america and the caribbean. with too much delay, all of their leaders have finally acknowledged what everybody knew: no crisis with this impact in the united states and europe could avoid ravaging latin america as well. now all these leaders have to do is decide how to protect their societies, and how to pick up the pieces when the time comes.castañeda is the former foreign minister of mexico and global distinguished professor at new york university.",2008-10-27,financial crisis

""we need to understand that the old ways of looking at our cities just won't do.""donovan will inherit various tools to confront the problem. obama wants to use the second half of a $700 billion financial industry rescue plan to help stem foreclosures. congress this year also put in place a $300 billion program designed to let troubled homeowners swap risky loans for more affordable ones, though few have applied. moreover, homeowners have continued to default on mortgages despite government efforts to lower interest rates and modify repayment terms.with one in 10 u.s. homeowners delinquent on mortgage payments or in foreclosure, obama said donovan will bring ""fresh thinking, unencumbered by old ideology and outdated ideas"" to the housing and urban development department to help resolve the housing and ***economic crisis**.donovan, head of new york's housing preservation and development department, is a former clinton administration hud official with a national reputation for curtailing low-income foreclosures, developing affordable housing and managing the nation's largest housing plan.""mr. donovan's background prepares him to address the extremely difficult challenges our country faces in helping americans find affordable housing,"" said sen. christopher dodd, d-conn., chairman of the senate banking, housing and urban affairs committee.if confirmed by the senate, donovan would become the nation's top housing official in the midst of the worst ***recession** in decades. falling home values and stricter lending standards have ensnared millions of u.s. households. more than 259,000 homes received a foreclosure-related notice in november, up 28 percent from a year earlier.conrad egan, president of the nonpartisan national housing conference, said obama's selection of donovan signals that he recognizes hud can play a big role in the economic recovery.""it really needs to be a seat at the cabinet table that is the principal point where housing and community development issues are brought together and resolved successfully,"" egan said. ""hud has been perceived as a second-tier participant in meeting that challenge.""obama's housing plans, as spelled out during his campaign and the current transition, include:-enacting a 90-day foreclosure moratorium for homeowners ""who are acting in good faith.""-getting treasury and hud to coordinate with state housing agencies to restructure mortgages.-reforming the bankruptcy code to help homeowners.-enacting a 10 percent refundable tax credit on mortgage interest.""this plan will only work with a comprehensive, coordinated federal effort to make it a reality,"" obama said.

""but like my parents, i became a democrat because i liked how they seemed to fight for the middle class and underserved.""on the environment, one of the biggest issues in the district, kratovil has cast himself as similar to gilchrest, a longtime advocate of measures to protect the chesapeake bay. harris has presented himself as an environmentalist, too, but has criticized many past measures as ineffective and unnecessary.on the economy, the two have largely pursued traditional lines of attack. both opposed the first version of the bailout plan that went to congress. at a debate last month, kratovil blamed the crisis and lack of solutions on partisan gridlock; harris blamed past liberal policies.""it's still harris's race to lose, but the economy is starting to close out everything else as the main issue, and the longer that goes on, the more it helps kratovil,"" said michael cain, head of political science at st. mary's college.then again, in a race this tight, cain said, ""the only thing we know for sure right now is that it's looking like it'll be very close.""",2008-10-17,economic crisis

''if banks start lending to each other that would be a very positive sign and that would be key.''  many borrowers are being penalized in the bond markets, if they can borrow money at all. credit spreads  --  the premium investors demand to lend money to everybody but the federal government  --  need to fall, said jerry webman, chief economist and senior investment officer for oppenheimerfunds. last week, in a rare reversal that occurs only in times of extreme stress  in the credit markets, tax-free municipal bonds  were yielding more than treasuries, which are not tax exempt.  many municipal and corporate borrowers were unable to borrow money in the credit markets last week. mr. webman said the economy could suffer  if those tight conditions persist.  ''credit is man's confidence in man,'' mr. webman said. ''that confidence in the financial system needs to increase.''  analysts said the market would be watching closely how the treasury department structured its planned purchases of troubled assets from financial firms. the government has suggested it might use auctions to establish prices for the securities and loans it plans to acquire. mr. zandi said the treasury should disclose more details in the next several weeks and conduct its first auctions soon after the presidential elections.  once investors have a better sense of what the troubled assets are worth, they will become more willing to invest in ailing financial firms that have not been able to raise capital because analysts fear they have not fully disclosed the quality of their assets.  ''we need to get clarity with respects to which institutions need to write down their assets and which institutions are well-capitalized,'' mr. zandi said. ''that would provide solace to investors who would then provide capital to the system.''  furthermore, once financial firms have raised more capital, a crucial test will be whether they plow that new money back into the market through loans and investments in businesses, said mr. webman. if banks remain fearful and hoard cash instead, as they have done in recent months, the rescue effort will only have a modest impact on the economy and financial system.  ''we need more capital coming into the market and actual investor money coming through the banks into economic activity,'' mr. webman said. ''that's what i would really like to see happen.''  but even if the government intervention is successful, economists and investors said it would not restore the days of easy credit that prevailed during the recent housing boom. mortgage rates should come down, but they are unlikely to return to the levels seen in 2003 and 2004. also banks are unlikely to make many adjustable-rate loans without verifying the  incomes and assets of borrowers.  furthermore, the rescue might not forestall a ***recession**, said g. david macewen, chief investment officer for the bond department at american century investments. though he thinks the rescue efforts will help the economy, mr. macewen expects bankruptcies to spread, home prices to fall and unemployment to rise.   ''having this plan contains the damage to some extent,'' mr. macewen said. but, he added, ''i think we are going to see slowing in economic activity. this is like steering a battleship, you make course adjustment but they take time to take effect.''",2008-09-29,c("recession", "recession")

""they were always the hometown airline. they were in the downtown parades. they invested in the community.""eagle's flights out of san luis obispo were running nearly 90 percent full. still, the airline, a unit of amr corp. and feeder carrier for american airlines, told nairne it was losing money on the service.the airport planned to spend $60 million on a new terminal and parking garage. now both are in limbo, nairne said, although she expects county supervisors will approve a scaled-down terminal.""we have a number of businesses that depend on good air service,"" said david garth, president of the san luis obispo chamber of commerce. ""it's going to be much harder for us to convince a high-tech company that they should come here. it hurts.""most u.s. airlines are cutting flights after the heavy summer travel season to reduce costs and drive up fares. they suffered big losses in the first six months of this year, largely because of a huge increase in jet fuel prices.leaders of dozens of airports, many of them smaller ones, were worried enough that they called an emergency strategy meeting last month in washington. they heard politicians blame the airline industry's problems on inadequate u.s. oil production and oil-price speculators.relatively speaking, dallas-fort worth is sitting pretty thanks to a stroke of only-in-texas good luck - an energy company has already paid the airport more than $160 million to drill for natural gas, and royalties could boost the tab for years to come.even so, american and american eagle will cut flights here beginning next month. airport officials predict the number of passengers will decline more than 7 percent, to about 54 million in the fiscal year that starts oct. 1, the smallest number in five years.that will mean about $15 million less in revenue from parking, rental cars and concessions, said ceo fegan. besides freezing the budget, landing fees will rise ""slightly,"" he said, and this week airport officials tossed around the idea of closing part or all of one of the terminals to save money.in cleveland, continental airlines inc.spoke just last year about increasing capacity by 40 percent in two years. instead, it will cut available seats 13 percent and end nonstop service to 24 cities.there will be about 160,000 fewer passengers a week passing through los angeles international airport, where capacity will fall nearly 11 percent, according to airline industry database innovata. american, delta air lines inc., and ual corp.'s united airlines are making big cuts; low-fare southwest airlines co. is standing pat.to offset fewer flights, lax is raising landing fees by 15 percent, to about $500 for a fully loaded boeing 737 and more than $2,000 for a full boeing 747 jumbo jet.airlines and airports often have tense relationships - partners in the travel business, but adversaries when it comes to haggling over landing fees.southwest is the only major u.s. airline not shrinking and so it stands to pay a larger share of landing fees. last month, ceo gary kelly complained that unlike airlines, airports do not control their spending during ***economic downturn**s, which runs up the tab on the airlines.""we have a few airports out there that i think are spending more than they should, quite frankly, and so there are some real total airport cost increases that we are very vocal about,"" kelly said.""the more you raise fees, the more you drive airlines and customers away,"" said howard putnam, a former southwest airlines ceo and now an aviation consultant.airport executives say they get the message and are keeping landing fees as low as possible.deborah mcelroy, executive vice president of the airports council international, a trade group for airports, said kelly's comments reflected the short-term view of airlines that must report to shareholders every quarter.""it's rhetoric i've heard for 41 years, but i understand,"" mcelroy said.

""look at the people on either side of you, because one of you won't be here anymore,"" said john chambers, head of health care investment for merriman curhan ford.the same investors coached the biotechnology executives on how they could stay alive by vying for money from alternative sources, but those, too, are directed toward mid- to late-stage companies.the sources include firms such as cowen healthcare royalty partners, which provides money to companies with established revenue streams. or symphony capital, which invests funds from endowments, foundations, public pension funds and family estates into small public companies or mature private companies.""well, at least chicken little didn't show up here today,"" said ian wisenberg, biocom's senior vice president of business development, getting smiles in the ballroom full of biotech executives.in its third year, biocom's investor conference aims to persuade the finance community that concentrates on the bay area and east coast to spend more time in southern california.fifty-two companies, equally split between privately held and publicly traded, will make their pitch to investors in the two-day conference.some need money now, some will need funding in a few months, and others are looking for potential partners. executives from other companies -- including well-funded startups amira pharmaceuticals, which is developing drugs for inflammatory disease, and gen-vault, which has technology for storing biological samples -- said they were just looking for some visibility that could help in the future.""this is my favorite investor conference,"" tracon pharmaceuticals chief executive charles theuer said. ""it's small enough that you can meet everyone you need to. if you go to the rodman and renshaw conference in new york, it's a total zoo.""tracon, a privately held company, received three rounds of equity funding from paramount capital investments that should ""keep it in good stead,"" theuer said. but in 2009, the company will be looking to partner with a large pharmaceutical company on the later-stage development of its cancer treatment, he said.by attending last year's conference, theuer said he made the contacts he needed for possible collaborations with pharmaceutical companies.more pharmaceutical-company-backed venture capital firms have moved to san diego hoping to find promising early investments.rajeev dadoo, a principal with sr-one, the venture arm of glaxosmithkline, has been visiting san diego several times a year. he's now opening an office in la jolla.the smaller venture funds are continuing to invest in the early-stage biotechnology companies that make up a large part of the industry in san diego, said standish fleming, a managing member of forward ventures, another of those firms.dadoo said the ***economic downturn** has made investors more cautious. to stand out, companies have to show that their product drives innovation and has the potential to be a first-in-class creation. such a product would generally be expected to be more lucrative to investors. what is not wanted by investors, and the people paying for consumer drugs, are new versions of drugs already on the market, dadoo said.however, companies that are finding new uses for existing drugs are also attractive to investors because much of the expensive safety aspects have been worked out and regulators are familiar with the medicines. an example is orexigen pharmaceuticals, a san diego company using combinations of already-marketed drugs to fight obesity.also opening a san diego office was binson patrick securities corp., a new york firm that helps companies raise capital by selling their shares when money is needed. san diego biotechnology veterans jack florio, an angel investor and former eli lilly executive, and gregory hanson, a former chief financial officer at several companies, were hired to run that office.biotechnology executives remain cautiously optimistic that the industry with weather this economic storm, said john dobak, chief executive of lithera, an 18-month-old private company with technology for targeted fat reduction.""there's lots of money out there that will be put to work,"" he said.in the public markets, about $110 billion has been invested in biotechnology companies since 1979, said stelios papadopoulous, a former biotechnology executive, industry analyst and investment banker.the initial public offering market has always been a good barometer for interest in the industry, papadopoulous said. based on its rebound after previous ***economic downturn**s, biotechnology is poised to see big initial public offerings when the economy turns positive, he said.but that is contingent on the industry having innovative ideas to keep investment dollars from going elsewhere, he said. promising areas for innovation may include stem cell biology and alternative energy, he said.",2008-10-28,c("economic downturn", "economic downturn", "economic downturn")

from different ends of the food spectrum to see how rising prices affect business and what options they have to stay in the black.shipping and handling not includedproduce wholesalers witness firsthand the effects of rising transportation costs. joe kuspa, co-owner of detroit-based metro produce inc., said his company's ability to counter increases is limited because of its heavy reliance on transportation.``i think we have the least amount of options because we are totally vulnerable to those (shipping) costs,'' kuspa said. ``even if we pay the same free on board (shipping and loading costs), we have experienced a dramatic increase in the price of transportation. just getting produce to detroit has raised 55 to 60 percent since march 2008.''kuspa said metro produce is paying between $16,000 and $19,000 per truckload of fresh mixed produce from california — about $7,000 of that pays for freight on an average load.shipping represents up to 60 percent of the unit cost to bring certain produce to detroit. as of july 1, a 50-pound box of wholesale potatoes costs between $21 and $27. last year during the same month the price was between $11 and $14, kuspa said.even though metro produce is able to maintain its gross sales from last year, it's unable to get the same markup as before.alternatives to shipping by truck are few and unappealing, kuspa said. take, for example, transporting idaho potatoes by rail. trains have the ability to carry 3.5 truckloads for $8,000 in a railcar. but shipping by rail takes 10 days, compared with three days by truck. there's also no guarantee that the produce will arrive fresh.signing an annual rate contract with a trucking company is another option, but kuspa said he has yet to take a serious look at this avenue because of diesel fuel price fluctuations. if diesel goes down, he's stuck paying the contract price.kuspa said he's been forced to alter the way he does business. kuspa said his best strategy is to tighten metro produce's inventory to ensure it reflects customers' needs.with no foreseeable end to rising costs, and a lack of understanding among customers, kuspa remains frustrated.``with all the consumers feeling it at the gas pump,'' he said, ``i think there's a reluctant understanding of increased cost at the supermarket.''evolving through adaptationkosch catering and dining services relied heavily on corporate meetings and events, but budget cutbacks among clients forced the company to re-examine its customer base to stay viable during turbulent times.it's not easy, said gordie kosch, president and ceo of the rochester-based company. it took tenacity, determination and a survival instinct to persevere.``in 2004, we had $250,000 worth of business from a big, tier-one company. now that company provides about $50,000,'' kosch said. ``business and industry feeding used to represent about 50 percent of the contract side of our business, whereas eight years ago it was 100 percent.''now, kosch serves country clubs, schools and universities, hospitals and nursing homes. he began recognizing the need to diversify his business in 2001.in addition to expanding its available services, kosch also has looked internally to reduce costs.``fuel and food inflation require a significantly greater allocation of resources to cost-effectively manage it and combat its effects,'' kosch said.he encourages owners to scrutinize every expense.``it's important to ask yourself if a menu item can be engineered with products that aren't so expensive,'' kosch said. ``maybe provide smaller meat portions but more vegetables so the plate still has the same volume but is proportioned differently.''small changes, communicationwhile rising costs are affecting nearly every aspect of the food industry, restaurant owners are making tough decisions on how to curtail them without losing their customer base.bill roberts, owner of streetside seafood in birmingham, town tavern in royal oak and the beverly hills grill in beverley hills, has managed to navigate the current ***economic downturn** without sacrificing quality through flexibility and communication.``if you cut, cut, cut, you end up cutting out the reason people come to your establishment in the first place,'' roberts said. ``quality and service are the most influential parts of sales. without quality and service, it doesn't matter what the price is.''to make it easier to identify ways to reduce costs, it is important to have open lines of communication with and between employees. roberts said they can help identify unnecessary expenditures.``the chefs from all three restaurants will communicate together if they find a good deal on ingredients,'' roberts said. ``it's like when a family sees specials at a grocery store and tells others about them.''roberts also said owners should be involved in their restaurant's daily operation to find small changes that can make a big impact.``in 2003 i switched from using black cocktail napkins to white. this saved about $5,000 annually at beverly hills grill and saved us around $12,000 annually throughout all three restaurants,'' roberts said.it's also necessary to be flexible. roberts' restaurants print menus three times a year to adjust for price increases on specific items. they also use a ``specials'' chalkboard to make targeted price increases.``when guests leave your restaurant, will they be able to tell you what color the bar napkin was? no, but they will remember the food, and customers will go back to the restaurants they know they like,'' roberts said.nathan skid: (313) 446-1654, nskid@crain.com",2008-07-21,economic downturn

according to data provided by the state department of employment, training and rehabilitation.unemployment in las vegas increased by seven-tenths of a percentage point, to 6.5 percent.the last time nevada's unemployment rate was this high was in february 1994, when it was 6.4 percent. it came toward the end of a ***recession** when the unemployment rate topped out at 7 percent for a few months

number of nevadans without a job is troubling, both for the struggles those individuals and families are going through, and as a symbol of the turmoil our economy is going through,\"" he said in a statement.\""as a state, we must continue working to encourage businesses to retain their workers and expand and hire new ones. to do so we cannot put an additional tax burden on businesses that are already struggling and coping with the ***economic downturn** through layoffs. as we struggle to keep our budget balanced, i remain committed to doing so without raising taxes.\""state treasurer kate marshall said that nevada has long been a magnet for workers from other states, but that the influx of new residents may finally be taking a toll.\""the gaming industry provides a lot of jobs, but they can't do it by themselves,\"" she said.nevada's jobless figures reflect the fact that the number of individuals actively seeking employment has increased every month this year, growing by 27,200

and carson city employment has fallen by 500.\""employers are being forced to adjust to a challenging business climate constrained by fuel-related inflation and lagging consumer demand,\"" anderson said. \""businesses are finding it difficult to pass price increases onto customers and are struggling to maintain employment levels.\""one area of job growth continues to be government employment, which totaled 158,900 jobs in june, compared to 155,600 jobs in june 2007. most of the increase, or 2,800 jobs, came at the local government level.exacerbating the unemployment situation in nevada is a lackluster gaming economy, anderson said.gross gaming win fell by 15.7 percent in may, the largest monthly year-over-year drop in more than 10 years. the total win fell below $1 billion for the first time in 11 months. all major markets saw declines except carson valley.the decline will place added pressure on government budgets, anderson said. june initial claims for unemployment benefits in nevada were more than 33 percent higher than year-ago levels. the average duration of a claim was up by 4.6 percent, with more than 40 percent of claimants exhausting their benefit rights.the casino and hotel sector saw a 3.8 percent drop in the number of workers, from 215,100 last june to 211,000 this june.there is some good news though for the approximately 50,000 nevadans who previously ran out of benefits or who may run out before march 31 of next year.under a bill passed by congress and signed by the president, claimants currently unemployed with no additional benefit rights will get an additional 13 weeks of benefits. the federally funded benefits should give a boost to households and provide a measurable injection of economic stimulus.economic conditions are not expected to improve anytime soon.in a report from the state department of administration dated june 20, the continued housing and ***mortgage crisis** and resulting contraction in residential construction is expected to hamper nevada's growth into fiscal year 2009-10 .other bleak projections in the report for this fiscal year: new and existing home prices will post declines, retail trade sales will be off 4.4 percent and visitors to clark county will fall by 3 percent.if there is a bright spot, it is the state's mining industry, according to the employment report.\""although nevada's economy as a whole

""people can't fill up their car with gasoline. people are losing their homes. and he's in canada and colombia worried about more free trade, which will export american jobs.""hoffa said mccain's prospects are especially bleak in the very places where many observers expect the presidential race to be most critical: manufacturing states such as ohio, michigan and pennsylvania.""trade is basically killing jobs in all the major states in the midwest,"" hoffa said.sallie james, a trade policy analyst for the libertarian cato institute, rejected that argument, saying the benefits of free trade are more difficult to see. but she acknowledged that mccain will probably take a beating in those states for his position.""his stance on free trade is not going to win him the election,"" she said.

""it is, if it reinforces his brand as a straight talker.""that was clearly on mccain's mind as he boarded his new campaign jet, emblazoned with the straight talk express logo, for the trip to colombia.in order to assuage voters' concerns about lost manufacturing jobs, mccain said he will push to revamp u.s. programs aimed at workers who lose their jobs to overseas plants. calling those programs ""terrible,"" mccain said he would empower community colleges to take charge of the programs even as he pushed to lower trade barriers for foreign goods.""we need to fix the displaced-worker program and the unemployment insurance program to bring it up to the 21st century from the 1950s. . . . herbert hoover signed into law the smoot-hawley tariff acts and we went from a ***recession** to the country's deepest depression in modern history,"" he said. ""so i've got to convince people, particularly those who have recently and suddenly lost their jobs, that i have a plan to give them the kind of education and training they need, so they can reenter the workforce and lead even more profitable and better lives than the jobs they left.""asked whether the trip could bolster his standing among latinos, a voting bloc he has courted assiduously, mccain said hispanic voters are more interested in his stances on education, jobs and health insurance than on his trips abroad.""i hope that it would give them some assurance that i understand the issues and challenges that the countries that they came from face, but i don't think there's a large number of voters that are going to say, 'gee, john mccain went to wherever it was and therefore i'm going to vote for him,' "" he said.the larger question, however, is whether mccain's outspoken support for greater ties to latin america will prove a liability with some americans who have grown increasingly hostile to latino immigrants, both legal and illegal.during the primaries, mccain did worst among voters who identified immigration as their top concern. an abc news analysis of polling data from all states with gop exit polls showed that mccain received only 30 percent of the vote in that group, while getting more than 40 percent of voters with other top issues.the issue of immigration remains a vital one for the republican party's conservative base. a usa today-gallup poll found that 73 percent of conservatives describe the issue of illegal immigration as very important or extremely important this year. among all adults, 58 percent described illegal immigration that way.during a town hall meeting in pipersville, pa., on monday, mccain did not discuss his latin american trip, but one woman questioned why she has to deal with spanish speakers in the united states.""why, as an american, do i have to push a button to speak english or hear english?"" she asked, prompting a huge round of applause.""i think you struck a nerve,"" mccain told the woman, laughing a little nervously.""i'm telling you, i really get ticked,"" she replied.mccain started his response by reiterating his commitment to cracking down on illegal immigration -- ""we have to have comprehensive immigration reform, and the first step has to be securing our borders."" but he also reminded the questioner that diversity remains a key part of america's identity.""there's a thing that's wonderful about america, and i'm sure you'll appreciate it, we welcome all cultures from all over the world,"" he said.shear reported from washington. polling analyst jennifer agiesta in washington contributed to this report.",2008-07-02,recession

[and] a photocopying machine doesn't care whether i'm a democrat or a republican.''word-splitters may care to call this something other than corruption. but the pennsylvania general assembly has to decide how to balance a budget with much less money. before it cuts anything, it must cut itself.""

(us insurers do not cover piracy. figures released last month by marine broker aon reveal the surcharge for separate kidnap and ransom coverage could mean a shipowner pays an extra $30,000 per journey - for every $3 million worth of coverage - through high-risk seas - 10 times that charged last year. insurance firms are sensitive to suggestions that they benefit from the actions of pirates wielding rocket-propelled grenades, more so when their shipowning clients are wheezing from the impact of ***recession**. but with 22,000 gulf transits a year, additional premiums could be worth up to $400 million, says j. peter pham, a piracy expert at james madison university in harrisburg, va. ""we've seen inquiries for [coverage] escalate as shipowners seek to protect their employees and businesses,"" explains ashley leszczuk from aon's crisis-management team. ""the cost of insurance is simply rising in correlation with the risk of kidnap in piracy hot spots."" for decades piracy was deemed a low-level risk and designated as a ""marine peril"" covered by insurance for loss or damage to the ship's hull. but the success of somali pirates has forced insurers to weave new policies. piracy is now a ""war risk"" - a pricier coverage - and shipowners must either pay up or brave traveling with poor coverage. there are also additional protection and indemnity premiums covering crew safety - an issue of increasing importance as shipowners weigh the risks of hiring armed guards. one shipping broker for a leading market player, who spoke on condition of not being named, says the firm is surcharging a minimum of 0.125 percent of the hull value, rising to 0.2 at the top. war policies without the amended piracy clause cost around 0.025 percent early last year.

""those goals are the foundation of the american dream, and they are the focus of my tax policy.""still, thousands of protesters marked the day federal income taxes were due by attending hundreds of ""tea parties"" from florida to hawaii, organizers said. the rallies were promoted by freedomworks, a conservative nonprofit group led by richard k. armey, a lobbyist and texas republican who once served as house majority leader.in a pre-rally telephone interview from atlanta, where he was preparing to speak on the steps of the statehouse, armey conceded that ""the federal tax rate right now is at a good level."" but, he said, ""there are very few people who believe obama will be content to leave it at that.""armey said the real target of the protesters' ire is not the current tax rate but the much higher one that will be needed to pay for trillions of dollars in financial-sector bailouts; the stimulus package, which is projected to add nearly $800 billion to the federal debt over the next 10 years; and obama's ambitious health-care and education initiatives, which are projected to raise the debt by trillions of dollars more.""there's no way he can do the spending he does and cut taxes for most people,"" armey said. ""people know that spending inevitably means more taxes.""the white house stuck to its own low-tax message yesterday, as obama repeated his ""clear promise that families that earn less than $250,000 will not see their taxes increase by a single dime."" asked whether obama is confident that he can stick to that pledge throughout his administration, press secretary robert gibbs told reporters: ""he is. he is. he is.""to add heft to that promise, the white house released a lengthy list of tax breaks included in the stimulus package to benefit college students, car buyers, first-time home buyers, families with children, poor people and others -- all told, about 120 million households.overlooked was one big drawback for the nation's finances: more people are likely to pay no income taxes at all.according to the most recent irs statistics, about 45 million households -- a third of all filers -- owed no federal income tax after taking their credits and deductions in 2006. this year, with the profusion of new credits in the stimulus package, about 65 million households -- or 43 percent of all filers -- are likely to owe no income taxes, according to a new analysis by the tax policy center, a joint project of the urban institute and the brookings institution.of course, even filers who have no income tax liability still pay federal taxes, due in large part to the payroll tax, which funds federal insurance programs like social security. according to the cbo, taxpayers shelled out an average of 7.5 percent of their earnings in payroll taxes in 2006.but if the ***recession** lingers and congress and the white house consider another economic stimulus package, that tax could temporarily disappear, as well. economists say one of the first items that should be considered is a payroll-tax holiday.staff writer michael d. shear contributed to this report.",2009-04-16,recession

strickland warned monday that he could be forced to close two adult prisons and juvenile facilities and cut off mental health treatment and other services to tens of thousands of ohioans.the democratic governor said a proposed $25 billion reduction in general aid targeted to cash-strapped states to shore up their budgets and preserve essential social services would have a \""devastating impact\"" on ohio.among other things, it would undercut his plan for at least a one-year freeze on tuition at state universities and colleges, requiring 40 percent of students to pay more.mr. strickland's two-year $54.7 billion budget proposal is barely a week old.the plan is dependent on about $5 billion in one-time funding, including $3.4 billion in general and targeted emergency federal aid that has yet to be delivered.spokesman amanda wurst said the $25 billion reduction in direct proposed state aid nationally could translate into a $930 million reduction in general aid for ohio.\""put simply, without substantial fiscal relief for states, more ohioans will lose jobs and fewer ohioans will have access to the critical services that our state and local communities provide,\"" mr. strickland said in a letter sent yesterday to members of ohio's congressional delegation.the u.s. house passed an $819 billion economic stimulus package sought by president obama solely with democratic votes. but despite a democratic majority in the senate, republicans succeeded in forcing a compromise with the white house after arguing that the plan was too heavy on government spending and too light on tax relief.a compromise $827 billion plan that could come to a vote today is expected to draw support from a handful of moderate senate republicans. the compromise would slash proposed one-time aid for states for such things as education, social services, and highway and bridge construction in favor of more general tax cuts and tax credits designed to boost car and home sales.whatever the final vote, the package is destined for a senate-house conference committee to hammer out a final bill.\""as an elected official, i believe that fiscal restraint and taxpayer accountability are fundamental responsibilities rightly demanded by the people we serve,\"" mr. strickland wrote.\""they deserve nothing less. yet nearly all economists agree that substantial federal spending is necessary today to avoid the dangers of deflation and to stimulate a stagnant national economy.\""ohiohouse republican leader bill batchelder (r., medina) said the state is playing a \""dangerous game\"" by proposing to balance its budget on federal support that doesn't yet exist.he and other republicans have also argued that the strickland budget, which increases spending 4.4 percent over two years despite declining tax revenues, will simply delay the day of reckoning for the budget another two years.\""in my opinion, there is an incredible amount of wasteful spending within this federally funded stimulus plan,\"" said mr. batchelder.\""the people of ohio are looking for fiscal responsibility. if the federal government passes on funding to the people by care of the state, as state leaders we are then charged with the responsibility to ensure that the funds are used in such a way that we do not push the state's problems into tomorrow.\""the $930 million proposed reduction in direct general state aid is almost exactly the amount by which mr. strickland has proposed increasing state aid to k-12 schools over the next two years. but ms. wurst said the governor remains committed to his proposed education reforms.\""the governor believes this investment in education is critical for ohio to emerge from this ***recession**, so he will make the necessary tough decisions to continue the investment in education,\"" she said.the compromise package expected to come to a vote in the u.s. senate also holds less in education aid for schools, but the strickland administration is still studying how that would affect ohio.the letter mr. strickland sent yesterday mentions no specific cuts for k-12 education.between the general aid and other cuts in specific targeted aid, social service advocates argue the senate plan could hold $40 billion less for all states.\""of all the talk of economic recovery, this stimulus money will help retain jobs -- 8,000 or

you must refuse some stuff.a: what we don't accept is merchandise that is not stable. rickety tables, cracked wood, things that aren't usable. there has to be a certain degree of stability. fabric can have different (issues), like stains and pet problems. we clean things up and merchandise them, trying to set up a vignette.q: who decides how much things sell for?a: we have a staff of three of us that do the assessment of the value. that's done by a market approach to pricing, and we get that market value from information we derive from items we've sold. we also use the internet. if something doesn't sell, every 30 days there's an automatic reduction of 15 percent. it's a four-month contract, at the end of which it's up to the consigner to pick up merchandise if it doesn't sell. q: how's the sale price divided?a: it's a 50-50 split. that's pretty much the industry standard.q: do you have a web site?a: we are in the process of building a web site now (www.cherishedpossessions.com). it should be (up) within the next three or four weeks.q: will it be informational, or will you sell stuff online?a: we're not going to sell at the beginning, but we have plans to do that down the road. it will be informational - the merchandise that comes in each week, prices, highlighting some of the nicer items, plus information about consigning and how it works.q: what did you used to do?a: i was a burger king franchisee and also had several other franchises. i was with the burger king system for over 20 years, in louisville, ky., and buffalo, n.y., roughly from 1976 to 1998. i worked in corporate as well, so i was on both sides of the fence. after that i was a franchisee for a sub sandwich company by the name of jersey mike's, in tampa, fla. i was also in the consumer fireworks business, and had retail outlets, also in tampa.q: interesting progression. from burgers to fireworks to consignment.a: well, i had a friend who did fireworks, and i'd known him for 10 or 15 years, and we thought, 'why not do a joint venture?' i would still be doing it, other than that the county banned sales of fireworks. that was around 2002, somewhere in there. and then i almost got into a taco situation in nashville with some friends, but a financial partner backed out. so here i am.q: what brought you to the portland area?a: i just decided to pick a place in the u.s. that seemed to be attractive to live in and find a different job. so i decided to do this, and it's been extremely interesting.q: had you ever been to maine before?a: no. i used a business broker, cbi, and they were very helpful in working with me to get a business.q: so they found you one in south portland, maine.a: correct.q: was it expensive to buy?a: well, like anything else, that's relative to sales, so ...q: have you felt the economic blips?a: well, it's affected the consignment business, at least the furniture end of it, i guess to the same degree as any other business. if people aren't selling their homes, going to high-end furniture stores and purchasing new, and getting rid of the old, it affects us. so a lot of people think this is a ***recession**-proof business, but it's not. but i will say that things are picking up. i think the worst is over. it's really starting to be a good time to consign again.q: how old is the business?a: it was started in 1986, so at least 23 years ... i'm the third owner, i guess.q: when i was a kid, your building was a grocery store.a: that's what i've been told. the location? actually i think it's pretty convenient, just over the casco bay bridge. pretty central to south portland, and convenient to cape elizabeth and scarborough.q: you don't wish you were out by the mall?a: not particularly. we have nice off-street parking in the back. it makes things easy in that respect.q: do people ever break things in the store?a: it's surprising, with all the glassware we have, there's very little that breaks.q: ever get anything especially rare or valuable or old or cool?a: from time to time. i can't think of specifically really high-priced items. recently we have had several consignments of old japanese dishes, plates.&lt;!-- 200a(unknown) --&gt;... it's called imari. hand-painted, to a large extent. and a lot of old, old kitchen untensils, probably from the 1880s or 1890s.q: anything especially hard or challenging or unexpected about the business?a: not really. i guess the most notable, based on my business experience, is that there is more documentation needed than in anything else i've been involved in. everything is owned by the consigners, and therefore we're kind of like the middleman, supplying the opportunity to sell the merchandise. it's our responsibility to make sure it's done properly, and that requires quite a paper trail.q: are consigners ever unsatisfied with the prices?a: well, it's inherent in the business that there are negotiations. we don't try to put a price on something with the attitude that that's the final price. if a customer has a concern, we negotiate the price to where the customer feels good about it. we're able to work it out 99 percent of the time.",2009-04-30,recession

''we've never had an exact figure, but it has to be near a million,'' bev norwood, a close palmer associate for 31 years, said when asked how many palmer had signed.   that many autographs already in circulation could explain why a vintage pennzoil piggy bank bearing palmer's signature had not yet fetched an opening ebay bid of $4.99 by friday. palmer is proud of the autograph glut he has created, and plans to keep prices down by continuing to sign for free. he then turned his attention to the golf market.  q:your tournament seems to be doing well despite the tough economy. is it?  a: it is. we have more going on than we have ever had. the crowds have been good. we could use some more sponsors, but there's a lot of action.   q: some other events on tour are challenged, though. does it concern you?  a: i'm not overly concerned. i think maybe we're overstating the overall seriousness of the situation. the financial houses and the automotive industry are hit the hardest. but i think that will come back. i think that that's a temporary thing.  q:recently wachovia chose to remove its name from its tournament in may but will continue its sponsorship through 2014. does that strike you as unusual, that this would become a political issue?   a: that's exactly what it is. do i find it unusual? yes. but i think the fact they are living up to their commitments is very good, and i think once this ***recession** is gone it will return to normal. it's going to take maybe a couple years, but i think it'll go away, and we'll go back to the type of sponsorship that wachovia and some other financial institutions have given us because it is good customer relationships, and it creates a good customer relationship with the people that they're doing business with.   q:some critical comments from washington recently did not seem to reflect an understanding of the business?   a: i'm disappointed in our political reaction and actions right now. when some of our politicians are flying around the country in private airplanes all the time, using public services as their mode of private transportation, and then criticizing us who are in business.   q:you were born and raised during the great depression. any vivid memories?  a: i have a lot of recollections. my father was a greenkeeper.  i can remember details of what we had to do to survive, and i know in our case we lived on the edge of a golf course, and we thought it was normal that we raised chickens, we raised pigs, we butchered in the fall, and it was all a result of the depression. in 1939, my father bought a four-door chevrolet, financed it, and he paid it off in 1948. that kind of thing was sort of commonplace.  q:in 1960, you and the masters and television converged and you became synonymous with the event. lately there is talk about how lengthening augusta national has drained some drama because people want to see ...  a: birdies and eagles, right? there's no question that the galleries still like to see birdies and eagles. if you take them all away, it takes some of the dramatics, the excitement of a golf tournament and we don't want to do that.   q: switching gears, you and elvis both deserved the nickname of king, but some friends have said you don't like it. true?  a: that's right. i don't think golf has a king, and i don't think it needs a king. it just started and a lot of people, players, everybody picked it up. there were times, i suppose, that i was flattered they thought it was appropriate. but i never really did like it and i didn't think it was necessary.  q:it bothered you?  a: i suppose looking back now, the people that started it were very interested and didn't do it maliciously; they were doing it because they liked me and they felt like i was lending something to the game.  q:if you were the czar of golf, what would you change?  a: i would put in regulations to slow the ball down by 15 to 20 percent, so if a man drove it 300 yards, he'd be really hitting it. i want to take it back to where the golf courses are a little more challenging without making them 7,600 or 8,000 yards long. i'd also do a campaign to get the pace of play up a little bit. that's why i don't object to range finders. anything that would help people get around a golf course a little faster i'm in favor of.   q: you and your father had a special relationship that has been well-documented. other than your dad, who was a special influence on your life?  a: well, my father was no. 1. i can't ever remember him telling me something that was wrong, even to this day. the things that he told me or said to me have been right, and they are right today. dwight eisenhower was someone i'd put in the class with my father. i sat and talked to him for hours years ago, when he was ailing and not able to play golf anymore. we'd talk and have a beer, and his remarks were much on line with what my father had said. and of course we got into other areas that i won't talk about, likes and dislikes. i thought he was one of the wonderful people that i had the privilege of knowing in my life.  q:anything you would like to have a mulligan on?   a: (laughs) i'd like to have a do-over on a couple p.g.a. championships. but, no, i'm pretty happy with golf. i think when i started playing and the purses were $10,000 -- that's $10,000 total money -- and i see how fast and how quickly it went up, which was my objective to help make that happen, and it happened. it may have happened a little faster than maybe i thought it should, but certainly i'm very happy that it made the progression that it did. i suppose looking at the overall scene, the golf picture is pretty good. i'm not happy about losing the number of golf courses we're losing through this ***recession**. that bothers me. but again, a ***recession**, no one plans on ***recession**s or depressions, and there isn't much we can do. in my speech this morning one of the things that i said was that, you know, the world isn't going to go away. we're going to come back. we'll see the game come back and gain its position again.  q: are there any positives resulting from the ***recession**?   a: i think there's some good news, too, and the good news is that the players have become more aware of the fact that we need sponsors, and we need the good will that is created by the players being, let's say, cooperative with the sponsors -- meaning friendly.   q: being friendly was not something you needed to be reminded about, was it?

"221","7V8Y-TP90-Y9NC-P2CK-00000-00.txt","things sure are different now than the last time the hanover school board sat down to negotiate a new teachers contract.last time, negotiations took about a year and nearly resulted in a teachers strike. this time, the new contract was finalized - three months earlier than needed - during a weekend retreat attended by negotiating teams from both sides.the five-year contract, which takes effect july 1, includes an average salary increase of 3.9 percent in the first year, 4.1 percent in the second year, and 4 percent in each of the remaining three years. the increases are tilted more heavily to younger teachers still moving through the step system of seniority and post-graduate education. it's not unusual to see this kind of uneven distribution of increases, generally reflecting a school board's desire to raise starting salaries in order to attract and retain high-caliber young teachers. a starting salary that will rise to $41,420 next year should help in that goal.the new contract also includes increases in the teachers' contributions for their health insurance. that increase will include higher co-pays for office visits and prescription drugs, as well as hikes in the amount teachers pay monthly for their health coverage.and that's a good thing. for several years now, school boards and teachers unions throughout the area have been moving toward more realistic agreements on health coverage. the skyrocketing costs of health care over the past decade have done away with the expectation that taxpayers would or should provide fully paid health insurance for public employees.granted, the hanover teachers still have a pretty good deal on health insurance. for instance, the monthly premium for family coverage with a traditional preferred provider option is just $115 a month.but the board did negotiate a clause that, over the final two years of the new contract, teachers' premium contributions will increase or decrease by the same percentage as the district's change in premium costs. that was a responsible move by the board - and by the teachers who agreed.so, what's not to like about this new contract?well, as we said at the outset, things are different now. there's a global ***economic crisis** out there. people are losing their jobs left and right. those who still have jobs are hearing that there will be no raises this year. some, in fact, are taking pay cuts in order to keep their jobs - and help keep their employers in business.but at the hanover school district, the coming year will bring an average increase of 3.9 percent. we understand that some teachers - about 24 of them, according to the teachers union president - will actually get less than 1 percent. so, if 3.9 percent is the average, then some teachers will be getting considerably more. when news of the contract success was announced, the school board and teachers union couldn't congratulate themselves enough. we heard a long tribute to the ""timed mediation"" process of negotiation. and no doubt it is a worthwhile process.but instead of racing through the negotiations, maybe the board should have taken a little more time. the contract didn't have to be signed, sealed and ratified three months early. given some more time, maybe the board could have won some contract concessions - for the first year, at least - more suited to these troubled economic times.maybe the board negotiators should have said, ""hey, a lot of the people who pay your salaries are unemployed right now. and a lot of the rest of them are losing out on a pay raise this year.""and maybe the teachers union negotiators should have said, ""look, we're part of this community. and in the spirit of solidarity, maybe our members would agree to forgo increases for the first year of the contract. let's ask them.""we realize the chances of all that happening were slim - make that mighty slim. but that's what should have happened. instead, we got a quickie contract, with salary hikes that, while they might have been quite reasonable a year or two ago, are all out of proportion to what's going on now.it probably is beyond belief that a teachers union would agree to sacrifice for the good of the community. but then, we've seen lots of things in the past six months that we would have thought beyond belief.",2009-03-22,economic crisis
"222","7VF8-1DS1-2PBB-20W0-00000-00.txt","c(""michael meyer's book, ''the last days of old beijing,'' comes out in paperback in may."", ""''in the old days,'' the novelist henry bech, john updike's fictional alter ego, once said, ''a respectable author never asked for an advance; that was strictly for the no-talents starving down in the village.''  since then, washington square rents have soared, and writers of fair and ill repute alike seek advance payment for their books. once minuscule, some advances have escalated into the millions, like the $5 million scribner paid last month for audrey niffenegger's second novel, ''her fearful symmetry.'' news of that deal may have seemed odd coming shortly after the chief executive of simon &amp; schuster, scribner's parent company, announced that because of declining revenue the house would be ''watching every penny.'' indeed, in the latest of a string of eulogies for the book industry as we know it, time magazine fingered advances as part of the ''financial coelacanth'' of publishing's business model, doomed to disappear like brick-and-mortar bookstores.  yet despite the ***economic downturn**, and the fact that 7 out of 10 titles do not earn back their advance, the system doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon. in recent interviews, a dozen new york-based publishers and agents told me, more or less, ''publishers have to keep buying books,'' and ''they have to bid for the best books'' -- which in large part means those that will sell.   advances are seldom specified authoritatively. amounts are coyly described like cigarette brands -- the ''mid-fives,'' the ''low sixes,'' the ''mild sevens.'' in the preface to ''a heartbreaking work of staggering genius,'' dave eggers broke form by telling the reader he received $100,000 for the manuscript, which -- after his detailed expenses -- netted him $39,567.68.   advance envy is common. ''writers who can't recall their social security number can say to the penny how much of an advance their nemesis received,'' elissa schappell, a fiction writer and co-editor of the anthology ''money changes everything,'' said in an e-mail message. to an outsider, the numbers can seem arbitrary, even absurd. ''no one ever says of an advance, 'that's exactly what that book deserves,' '' schappell said. ''yep, a coming-of-age first novel involving drug addiction and same-sex experimentation is worth $25,000.''  as a payment to be deducted from future royalties, an advance is a publisher's estimate of risk. figures fluctuate based on market trends, along with an author's sales record and foreign rights potential, though most publishers i talked to cited $30,000 as a rough average. in standard contracts, the author receives half up front, a quarter on acceptance of the manuscript and a quarter on publication, though that model is changing, said the literary agent eric simonoff, whose clients include james frey and jhumpa lahiri. ''now we see advance amounts being paid in thirds, fourths and even fifths,'' simonoff said in an interview. ''for a writer dependent on those funds, that's not an advance, it's a retreat.''  the numbers can sound much bigger than they are. take a reported six-figure advance, roy blount jr., the president of the authors guild, said in an e-mail message. ''that may mean $100,000, minus 15 percent agent's commission and self-employment tax, and if we're comparing it to a salary let us recall (a) that it does not include any fringes like a desk, let alone health insurance, and (b) that the book might take two years to write and three years to get published. . . . so a six-figure advance, while in my experience gratefully received, is not necessarily enough, in itself, for most adults to live on.''  the novelist walter kirn agrees. ''a low-six-figure advance has allowed me to work at less than minimum wage for three years,'' he told me. ''perhaps that's for the best; a large advance might create a disinclination to do anything other than play blackjack in las vegas. when i hear these large, publicized advances, it feels like watching the casino play around me.'' (weep not for kirn, however; he phoned me from the set of the film adaptation of his novel ''up in the air,'' starring george clooney.)  the question of what to pay which authors has confounded publishers at least since a stationer agreed to give milton $:5 for the right to sell ''paradise lost.'' joseph conrad often begged his agent for more money and once asked to be advanced ''a fountain pen of good repute.''  but the current culture of blockbuster advances really took shape in the 1970s, when ''hardcover publishing was becoming research and development for mass-market paperbacks,'' said peter mayer, who started the trade paperback division at avon books and is now publisher of overlook press. ''it was the hardcover houses who drove the increases by selling paperback rights.''   in 1971, for example, viking sold paperback rights to ''the day of the jackal'' to bantam for 36 times the $10,000 hardcover advance it had paid its author, frederick forsyth. ''agents realized that they should be the ones holding auctions for their authors and get advances more in line with the anticipated total value of their books,'' georges borchardt, who brokered the hardcover rights, said in an interview. (full disclosure: borchardt, who is my agent, got me $50,000 for my first, nonfiction book.)  in the 1980s and '90s, big money also started taking hold on the literary end. agents like andrew wylie succeeded in fetching celebrity-size advances for canonical authors -- norman mailer, philip roth, salman rushdie -- on the strength of their backlists and sales over time. before then, the biggest advances went to ''disgraced politicians and failed novelists,'' wylie said in an interview. not that everyone was happy about the litterateur's shift in fortunes. in 1995, martin amis drew the kind of anger reserved these days for derivatives traders when he left his longtime agent for wylie, who sold amis's novel ''the information'' for the then outlandish sum of half a million pounds, or nearly $800,000.   today, such figures are hardly unusual. jonathan safran foer's first novel, published in 2003, is said to have fetched $500,000. more recently, foer's brother joshua reportedly got $1.2 million for a book about memory competitions.  but some say that authors grabbing for the brass ring can risk not just ridicule and envy, but their careers. ''it used to be that the first book earned a modest advance, then you would build an audience over time and break even on the third or fourth book,'' morgan entrekin, the publisher of grove/atlantic, said in an interview. ''now the first book is expected to land a huge advance and huge sales. the media only reports those, not the long path of writers like john irving, richard ford, anne tyler and toni morrison. the notion of the 'first book with flaws' is gone; now we see a novelist selling 9,000 hardcovers and 15,000 paperbacks, and they see themselves as a failure.''  at publicaffairs, an independent house specializing in current events, advances are as good as capped, said its founder, peter osnos. osnos paid an average advance of $40,000 for publicaffairs' four new york times best sellers in 2008, including scott mcclellan's ''what happened,'' sums greatly augmented by royalty payments when the books hit it big. ''if the market says you need to pay $10 million to acquire a title, no one requires a publisher to pay it,'' he said in an interview. ''you're not going out of business if you don't pay that money.''  today, some publishers are experimenting with low or no advances. in exchange for low-five-figure advances, the boutique press mcsweeney's, founded by eggers, shares profits with its authors 50-50, as does the new imprint harper studio, which offers sub-six-figure advances.  as for henry bech, updike -- whose own advances were reputed to be modest -- never let him take money up front. but bech couldn't entirely avoid the commercialism engulfing publishing. he turned in his final manuscript to his longtime publisher, vellum press, which had been sold to a supermarket chain that peddled it to an oil company, which foisted it off on a shale-and-lumber conglomerate. ''it was like being a fallen woman in the old days,'' updike wrote. ''once you sold yourself, you were never your own again.''""

"229","7V4P-N431-2PBB-24GJ-00000-00.txt","despite assurances that the takeover of fannie mae and freddie mac would be temporary, the giant mortgage companies will most likely never fully return to private hands, lawmakers and company executives are beginning to quietly acknowledge.the possibility that these companies -- which together touch over half of all mortgages in the united states -- could remain under tight government control is shaping the broader debate over the future of the financial industry. the worry is that if the government cannot or will not extricate itself from fannie and freddie, it will face similar problems should it eventually nationalize some large banks.the lesson, many fear, is that a takeover so hobbles a company's finances and decision making that independence may be nearly impossible.in the last six weeks alone, the obama administration has essentially transformed fannie mae and freddie mac into arms of the federal government. regulators have ordered the companies to oversee a vast new mortgage modification program, to buy greater numbers of loans, to refinance millions of at-risk homeowners and to loosen internal policies so they can work with more questionable borrowers.lawmakers have given the companies access to as much as $400 billion in taxpayer dollars, a sum more than twice as large as the pledges to citigroup, bank of america, jpmorgan chase, general motors, wells fargo, goldman sachs and morgan stanley combined.regulators defend those actions as essential to battling the ***economic crisis**. indeed, fannie and freddie are basically the only lubricants in the housing market at this point.but those actions have caused collateral damage at the companies. on monday, freddie mac's chief executive, david m. moffett, unexpectedly resigned less than six months after he was recruited by regulators, having chafed at low pay and the burdens of second-guessing by government officials, according to people with knowledge of the situation.fannie mae has also experienced a wave of defections as people leave for better-paying and less scrutinized jobs.last week, fannie mae announced that it lost $58.7 billion in 2008, more than all its net profits since 1992. freddie mac is also expected to reveal record losses in coming days.most important, by taking over the companies, lawmakers have gained a lever over the housing market and national economy that many -- particularly democrats -- are loath to discard, legislators say.''once government gets a new tool, it's virtually impossible to take it away,'' said representative scott garrett, a republican of new jersey and member of the financial services banking subcommittee. ''and fannie and freddie are now tools of the government.''one reason that fannie and freddie will never return to their earlier forms is simple mathematics: to become independent, fannie mae and freddie mac must repay the taxpayer dollars invested in the companies, plus interest. even if the firms achieve profitability, it could take them as long as 100 years -- or longer -- to pay back the government. and almost no one expects the companies to return to profitability anytime soon.moreover, the takeover has provided legislators with a long-sought ability to influence the mortgage marketplace directly and pursue social goals like low-income housing.''there is a commitment to restructure these companies, and we are going to want to retain a hand in the things that matter, like affordable housing and making sure that the housing economy doesn't become a threat to the entire economy again,'' said representative barney frank, democrat of massachusetts and chairman of the house financial services committee. ''some of what these companies did will be returned to the private sector, and some of it is going to remain with a public entity.''republican lawmakers -- many of whom believe the federal government should not be involved in the mortgage business at all -- have signaled they will try to end the government's involvement with fannie and freddie, even as they acknowledge that effort is likely to fail.and lawmakers of all stripes are quietly voicing worries that government involvement in the mortgage industry could lead to the very problems that caused the current crisis.''when you use mortgage companies for political purposes, such as helping low-income borrowers or expanding homeownership, you make bad economic decisions,'' said mr. garrett, the republican congressman. ''and bad economic decisions are why we're in this trouble right now.''analysts say that one reason fannie mae and freddie mac were privatized in the first place was to prevent political whims from dominating the mortgage marketplace. the companies were founded by the government but sold to investors decades ago.''the theory was that if fannie and freddie were private, they would only be interested in profits, and so they wouldn't take too many risks,'' said thomas a. lawler, an economist who worked at fannie mae for more than two decades before leaving in 2006 to become a consultant. ''if the government owns fannie and freddie, politicians will make choices that make voters happy, but may not be wise from an economic standpoint.''of course, the past year has proved that focusing on profits alone doesn't protect you from bad choices, either,'' mr. lawler added.lawmakers are quietly discussing a handful of possible proposals for fannie and freddie. they range from outright nationalization, in which the government would formally absorb the companies and guarantee millions of new home loans, to public-private hybrids, in which lawmakers would explicitly backstop part of the mortgage industry if economic catastrophe strikes, and would dissolve fannie and freddie into smaller, private companies that would handle the day-to-day business of mortgage finance, but be heavily regulated.lawmakers say they are unlikely to begin serious discussion about the companies' futures until this fall.",2009-03-03,economic crisis

""the president ... understands the critical importance of fiscal discipline. now we need to see some action.""for the most part, obama's updated budget tracks the 134-page outline he submitted to lawmakers in february. his budget remains a bold but contentious document that proposes higher taxes for the wealthy, a hotly contested effort to combat global warming and the first steps toward guaranteed health care for all.meanwhile, the congressional budget plan approved last month would not extend obama's signature $400 tax credit for most workers -- $800 for couples -- after it expires at the end of next year.obama's ""cap-and-trade"" proposal to curb heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions is also reeling from opposition from democrats from coal-producing regions and states with concentrations of heavy industry. under cap-and-trade, the government would auction permits to emit heat-trapping gases, with the costs being passed on to consumers via higher gasoline and electric bills.also new in obama's budget details are several tax ""loophole"" closures and increased irs tax compliance efforts to raise $58 billion over the next decade to help finance his health care measure. the money would make up for revenue losses stemming from lower-than-hoped estimates for his proposal to limit wealthier people's ability to maximize their itemized deductions. ",2009-05-11,c("recession", "economic crisis")

"235","7VKX-MM41-2PBB-24NB-00000-00.txt","wages are falling all across america.  some of the wage cuts, like the givebacks by chrysler workers, are the price of federal aid. others, like the tentative agreement on a salary cut here at the times, are the result of discussions between employers and their union employees. still others reflect the brute fact of a weak labor market: workers don't dare protest when their wages are cut, because they don't think they can find other jobs.  whatever the specifics, however, falling wages are a symptom of a sick economy. and they're a symptom that can make the economy even sicker.  first things first: anecdotes about falling wages are proliferating, but how broad is the phenomenon? the answer is, very.  it's true that many workers are still getting pay increases. but there are enough pay cuts out there that, according to the bureau of labor statistics, the average cost of employing workers in the private sector rose only two-tenths of a percent in the first quarter of this year -- the lowest increase  on record. since the job market is still getting worse, it wouldn't be at all surprising if overall wages started falling later this year.  but why is that a bad thing? after all, many workers are accepting pay cuts in order to save jobs. what's wrong with that?  the answer lies in one of those paradoxes that plague our economy right now. we're suffering from the paradox of thrift: saving is a virtue, but when everyone tries to sharply increase saving at the same time, the effect is a depressed economy. we're suffering from the paradox of deleveraging: reducing debt and cleaning up balance sheets is good, but when everyone tries to sell off assets and pay down debt at the same time, the result is a ***financial crisis**.  and soon we may be facing the paradox of wages: workers at any one company can help save their jobs by accepting lower wages, but when employers across the economy cut wages at the same time, the result is higher unemployment.  here's how the paradox works. suppose that workers at the xyz corporation accept a pay cut. that lets xyz management cut prices, making its products more competitive. sales rise, and more workers can keep their jobs. so you might think that wage cuts raise employment  --  which they do at the level of the individual employer.  but if everyone takes a pay cut, nobody gains a competitive advantage. so there's no benefit to the economy from lower wages. meanwhile, the fall in wages can worsen the economy's problems on other fronts.  in particular, falling wages, and hence falling incomes, worsen the problem of excessive debt: your monthly mortgage payments don't go down with your paycheck. america came into this crisis with household debt as a percentage of income at its highest level since the 1930s. families are trying to work that debt down by saving more than they have in a decade  --  but as wages fall, they're chasing a moving target. and the rising burden of debt will put downward pressure on consumer spending, keeping the economy depressed.   things get even worse if businesses and consumers expect wages to fall further in the future. john maynard keynes put it clearly, more than 70 years ago: ''the effect of an expectation that wages are going to sag by, say, 2 percent in the coming year will be roughly equivalent to the effect of a rise of 2 percent in the amount of interest payable for the same period.'' and a rise in the effective interest rate is the last thing this economy needs.  concern about falling wages isn't just theory. japan  --  where private-sector wages fell an average of more than 1 percent a year from 1997 to 2003  --  is an object lesson in how wage deflation can contribute to economic stagnation.  so what should we conclude from the growing evidence of sagging wages in america? mainly that stabilizing the economy isn't enough: we need a real recovery.  there has been a lot of talk lately about green shoots and all that, and there are indeed indications that the economic plunge that began last fall  may be leveling off. the national bureau of economic research might even declare the ***recession** over later this year.  but the unemployment rate is almost certainly still rising. and all signs point to a terrible job market for many months if not years to come  --  which is a recipe for continuing wage cuts, which will in turn keep the economy weak.  to break that vicious circle, we basically need more: more stimulus, more decisive action on the banks, more job creation.   credit where credit is due: president obama and his economic advisers seem to have steered the economy away from the abyss. but the risk that america will turn into japan  --  that we'll face years of deflation and stagnation  --  seems, if anything, to be rising.

''but we have been succeeding in the most competitive market in the world for 31 years.''   indeed, in 2007, the first year it went up against ''wintuk,'' big apple achieved record high revenues of $7.5 million. during last year's ***recession** christmas, big apple was down 2.3 percent in sales. cirque did not release figures, but box office experts who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to discuss confidential information said  ''wintuk'' sales were  down some  20 percent. nevertheless, ''wintuk'' has sold 750,000 tickets since 2007, according to cirque.   ''we and big apple have different niches and audiences.'' mr. laliberte said    on a recent afternoon, during which he chain-smoked gauloises.  he described the beacon production, possibly titled ''vaudeville,'' as a show about that tradition, with a cast of 50 to 55, to be directed by david shiner, also  the director of  ''kooza.'' the show, written by laurence o'keefe, the author of music and lyrics for ''legally blonde,'' is to be in tryouts from nov. 19 through dec. 31 at the chicago theater in that city. the show will run at the beacon for at least three months and could be extended to half a year.   during those months ''we will continue to work with all artists, including the allman brothers band, to find the best alternative performance options while the vaudeville cirque show is at the beacon,'' said jay marciano, president of madison square garden entertainment.  another $20 million still unnamed show, for the music hall, ''will fully utilize the space and spend half of each year in paris or london,'' and have  72 to 80 performers, said mr. laliberte, a wiry 49-year-old former street accordionist, stilt walker and fire-breather who rarely talks to the press.   mr.  marciano said that ''it's only natural that we partner with them, given 'wintuk,' '' adding that the music hall ''is the only stage in the city that can handle such a large-scale production.''  cirque has long been circumspect about  its profits, but mr. laliberte acknowledged that it has felt the effects of the ***recession**. in las vegas, it has been ramping up its discount offers at its six shows. as a result, mr. laliberte said, in that city  ''our lowest occupancy is 82 percent.''   so, though mr. laliberte said that the cirque touring shows were up about 7 percent in revenues this year, cirque's six shows in las vegas are down 7 percent.   meanwhile, the company's casino show in macau, asia's gambling capital, has suffered after the chinese government  curtailed visits from the mainland because of concern about gambling losses. and an agreement to develop a permanent cirque show on palm jumeirah, a manmade island in dubai, is now in ***recession** postponement.   despite the down economy, mr. laliberte is aggressively making ''optimistic plans,'' of which new york's shows are a part, he said, adding that ''we've gone through three ***recession**s in cirque history, and they were all growth periods for us.''  cirque has the wherewithal to expand. last august the company sold a 20 percent stake to a dubai sovereign wealth fund and a real estate developer for $600 million, mr. laliberte said. the sale lined his pockets as well: according to forbes, mr. laliberte's personal wealth is $2.5 billion.  the privately held cirque does not disclose profits, but analysts who asked not to be named because they did not want to jeopardize their relationship with the company estimated a margin of more than 20 percent, better than the 18 percent return that casinos customarily aspired to before the ***recession**. mr. laliberte said cirque was forecasting $810 million in total revenue this year.   ''but we are not tsunami-proof,'' he said. referring to the casinos, he added, ''it is a scary crisis in vegas -- our partners have so much debt.''  cirque has been fighting against the undertow in which hotels have posted historically low occupancy despite historically low room rates.   some circus people, most of whom would not speak for the record because they did not want to alienate cirque, have suggested that with two more new york shows on the way and an elvis tribute show headed for las vegas, cirque is overextended, and have wondered whether the once-scruffy, former avant-garde commune -- which has transformed itself into a blue-chip multinational  disney would-be that has sold $7 billion worth of tickets -- is losing touch with its creative soul.   ''there has been some dilution of the quality of their product,'' said david rosenwasser, a veteran arena manager and former circus executive who is director of the greater st. charles convention and visitors bureau in missouri. ''i'm not as awed as i used to be. the shows are almost indistinguishable to me.''   but mr. laliberte countered that ''we constantly readdress the issue of our shows being too corporate,'' adding: ''every show must be one of a kind. and we must have fun.''",2009-04-29,c("recession", "recession", "recession", "recession", "recession")

''i don't dwell on it. i try to stay positive, and i try to stay well.''young is one of thousands of mainers who have become unemployed during the ***recession**. in december, maine's economy shed 3,400 jobs, bringing the total loss for the year up to 11,700. the unemployment rate reached a 16-year high of 7 percent in december, the latest month for which figures are available.it's not clear how many mainers are uninsured because of lost jobs. some may be able to get coverage through a spouse's employer. others may qualify for mainecare, the state's version of medicaid, or are continuing employer-based coverage temporarily through the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act (cobra).but the dramatic rise in unemployment, an increase in charitable care at hospitals and a spike in traffic at free clinics all suggest maine is following a national trend: more people are going without health insurance.a help line run by consumers for affordable health care fielded 183 new calls in january, a record for the organization.''what we're really seeing is the people who are falling through the cracks, those middle-income people,'' said cherilee budrick, spokesperson for the augusta group. ''they make just a little too much to qualify for public assistance that's out there, but they don't make nearly enough to buy their own insurance or purchase a cobra plan.''a lot of those people are generally in the younger adult ages, 21 to low- or mid-30s, and that's kind of alarming, because that's a lot of our work force that we're talking about. more and more, we're dealing with a lot of people who have lost their jobs, and they don't know what to do.''few affordable coverage optionsa new survey released last week by the kaiser family foundation indicates that americans are delaying doctor visits, surgeries and preventive care.in a telephone survey of 1,204 adults, 53 percent said they had cut back on health care in the past year because of concerns about costs. thirty-eight percent said they are very worried about affording needed health care. the figure is higher - 56 percent - among those who worry that someone in their household will lose a job this year. the survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.mainers are facing those same fears. although there are alternatives available to employer-funded insurance, for many, they're too cost-prohibitive.in maine, the average monthly cobra premium for family coverage eats up 99.4 percent of the average unemployment benefit, according to a study released in february by families usa.dirigochoice, the state-subsidized insurance program for small businesses and individuals, is not an option for newly laid-off workers because enrollment was capped about two years ago. about 2,000 people are on a growing waiting list, according to trish riley, director of the governor's office of health policy and finance.at the portland community free clinic on india street, staff members ''definitely have seen an increased number of calls from people saying they are calling because they just lost their jobs and lost their health insurance,'' said clinic director katie addicott.appointments are being booked two months ahead instead of the usual two weeks, she said. that's a first.''we've seen a lot of people who were our patients who were unemployed, got jobs, and they left us because they got health insurance,'' addicott said.

''we see a husband and wife that are both diabetics, and the wife takes it one day and the husband takes it the next, all to try to stretch the medication out.''hospitals in maine have been seeing the ***recession**'s effects in decreased patient volume and increasing bad debt and charity care. at maine medical center, charity care is up by 15 percent. at goodall hospital in sanford, it's up 8 percent.about half the hospitals participating in a december survey by the maine hospital association reported decreases in patient volume, with between a third and a half seeing decreases of more than 10 percent.in the primary care offices of mercy health system of maine, the phones were ringing less often last fall, and more patients were canceling appointments or failing to show up, said dr. jeffrey heckert, medical director of the primary care network.''they didn't even want to drive the five or 10 miles to the office, spend the money on the gas and the $5, $10 co-pay,'' he said, noting that the situation has since gotten better.the patients who did come in admitted to skipping medications and failing to fill prescriptions, heckert said.bosses stretch to offer benefitthe federal stimulus package recently passed by congress includes provisions to make cobra more affordable. a tax credit for eligible individuals would allow them to have cobra for nine months at 35 percent of the premium cost instead of the usual 102 percent, but health advocates say that even with that subsidy, it will be out of reach for some mainers. and it will cover only those who lost their jobs between sept. 1, 2008, and dec. 31, 2009.it's not clear how many people are using cobra now, because the government does not collect that information and relies instead on survey data, which is not sufficiently up to date to capture the effects of the ***recession**.mainecare, the state's medicaid program, has not yet seen a bump in enrollment. that typically occurs further into an ***economic downturn** because people will generally use their savings or cobra before enrolling, said health and human services commissioner brenda harvey.in january, the department saw a spike in food stamp applications, harvey said, which typically comes before increased demand for mainecare.it's not just job loss that's causing financial pain. as the ***recession** deepens, employers are finding it increasingly difficult to offer affordable coverage to their workers.''some employers are either dropping insurance or raising the deductibles and co-pays to the point where employees can't afford it,'' said the brunswick clinic's mcguire.

''i made sure i got a physical exam and mammogram. all the things that you should have done annually, or every other year, i got up to date. i refilled my medications.''young says it would have cost her $6,000 a year to extend the coverage she was getting through her employer, on top of a $4,000 medicare coverage gap for her husband.a knee injury recently sent young to the portland community free clinic, where the staff helped her apply for prescription assistance so she won't have to cut her pills in half anymore. but she still worries about the future, as she has yet to find another job.her predicament has taught her how to spend her money more wisely. she buys medications for controlling her cholesterol, diabetes and thyroid at wal-mart. she thinks about prevention by adding aspirin, vitamin e and fish oil to her regimen. she does yoga and exercises regularly, and visits a chiropractor once a month.young also applied for and received a grant that helps pay for her husband's medication, which runs $1,900 a month.when she has to, she visits the free clinic. it's a bit uncomfortable, but she believes the experience will make her a better nurse. she is determined to one day repay those who have helped her in her time of need.''when things are more prosperous for me, i'll give back,'' young said.

""he's a good man. a decent man. don't let him get slapped down by know-nothings.""oberstar and the panel's ranking republican, john l. mica of florida, said lahood was right to suggest that policy makers consider shifting from the current tax on motor fuel purchases to a levy based on the number of miles driven.the idea is expected to be a key recommendation of a task force due to report on ideas for restructuring the highway trust fund. but after lahood suggested the idea as an option during an interview last week with the associated press, white house press secretary robert gibbs dismissed it. speaking at a conference for state transportation officials on monday, oberstar said gibbs doesn't know anything about transportation policy and should stay out of the conversation. ""i've got news for you,"" oberstar said. ""transportation policy isn't going to be written in the press room of the white house.""mica took some of the blame for getting his old friend into hot water, saying he told lahood before his confirmation that the long-term answer to shortfalls in the fund that pays for highway, bridge and transit projects will have to include a mileage-based tax.""i was shocked,"" mica said of the backlash. ""it was almost unfair to ray and he's quite correct that it is an option.""many transportation experts agree that moving toward that fee would be a fairer way to tax those who are using the roads. a tax on gasoline, which currently funds the federal highway system, is not sustaining the program at its current level. ""we should look at the vehicular miles program, where people are actually clocked on the number of miles that they traveled,"" lahood told the ap on friday.critics immediately attacked the idea as ""big brother"" surveillance of their movements by the federal government, although the technology for such a switch is not developed and would likely not be implemented for a decade or so. gibbs moved quickly to distance the white house from the remarks by lahood, the former illinoishouse member who is one of two republicans in president obama's cabinet.""i can weigh in on it and say that it is not, and will not be, the policy of the obama administration,"" gibbs then told the ap. the 2005 highway law (pl 109-59) commissioned two task forces to identify new federal policies for surface transportation. the first, the national surface transportation policy and revenue study commission, said the government should move to a vehicle-miles-traveled levy by 2025. the second panel, the infrastructure financing commission, is expected to offer a similar recommendation this week. highway spending is outstripping the revenue generated from the motor fuels tax, which is not indexed to inflation. as motorists move to more fuel efficient cars and cut back on their driving, they buy less gasoline -- and pay less in motor fuels taxes.in his interview with the ap, lahood also said he would be reluctant to raise the motor fuels tax during a ***recession**,pilot programs in a few states have been successful at implementing taxes based on vehicle miles, but those have only been employed on a sampling of volunteer drivers. jack schenendorf, chairman of the first commission, said he hoped the exchange between the white house and lahood was a misunderstanding.

"243","7VMB-KP91-2PBB-246X-00000-00.txt","cotton is no longer king of the mississippi delta.  farmers working land that has bloomed a dazzling snowy white every september since before the civil war are switching to corn and soybeans. as gleaming silver corn silos go up on farm after farm, cotton gins are laying off workers or shutting down.  ''we're closer than  we've ever been to looking like iowa,'' said danny hargett, a veteran farmer who has decided for the first time not to grow any cotton this year on his 3,000 acres of fertile, well-irrigated land. ''it was extremely hard for me to make this decision, but the economics have made it almost impossible to make cotton a profitable crop.''  the most immediate cause of king cotton's decline is that people around the world are buying less clothing and home furnishings. global cotton production and consumption are dropping, and the agriculture department expects the nation's exports to fall by $1.2 billion this year.  cotton growers have seen hard times before, of course. as with other commodities, prices and acreage have gone up and down on economic cycles. but cotton farmers and farm economists say they have never seen a downturn quite like this, one that started during the global boom and has quickened in the ***recession**.  the agriculture department estimates that 8.8 million acres of cotton will be planted in the united states this year, down 7 percent from 2008 and 42 percent from 2006.   it will be the lowest cotton acreage since 1983, an anomalous year when farmers cut acreage after a string of bountiful harvests that created a surplus.  nowhere has the slump been  greater  than in mississippi, where farmers decreased their cotton planting to 365,000 acres in 2008, from 1.2 million acres in 2006. a survey suggested that could fall to 268,000 acres this year.   meanwhile, the number of gins in the state has dropped to 71, from 89 in 2006, said darrin dodds, an extension service agronomist at mississippi state university, who predicts this year, ''we may lose a few more.''   cotton acreage has been declining in mississippi for decades, but it remained the crop of choice for many farmers in the delta, the fertile region in the northwestern part of the state, where the mississippi and yazoo rivers share a flood plain.  not everyone is likely to feel nostalgia for a crop long associated with abject work conditions and low wages. though a source of wealth, cotton was also a source of back-breaking work for slaves and sharecroppers, and later for poor farm laborers.  early in the 20th century, the travail of picking cotton in the blazing delta sun was a touchstone theme for the blues musicians of the region. later, mechanization in the cotton fields contributed to several waves of black migration from the south to industrial cities of the north, and to high rates of unemployment for those left behind. these days, cotton is rarely picked by hand -- machines do the work.   cotton's cultural roots are still on display around greenwood, where visitors are welcomed by a sign proclaiming it ''cotton capital of the world.'' some people plead with farmers to keep planting cotton beside the roads, considering it prettier than other crops, and fearing that corn stalks will obstruct drivers' vision on curved roads.  ''it's a funny sense, a different sense, not seeing the cotton crop,'' said mike sturdivant jr., a farmer who has cut his cotton crop to 2,400 acres this year, from 4,900 in 2007. ''i don't like it.''   the rapid slump of cotton in the united states has been influenced by numerous factors, including weather and the plummeting fortunes of the american textile industry. but lately, the most important factor has been the declining profitability of cotton farming, in contrast to the rising profitability of corn and soybean farming.  poor canola harvests in europe and dietary changes in several countries produced a world shortage of vegetable oil, pushing up the price of soybeans, which are crushed for their oil. meanwhile, as middle classes grew in china, india and other developing countries, demand for feed grains grew, and world corn prices rose.  ''globalization has dethroned king cotton without question, not only in mississippi, but throughout the south and the united states,'' said o. a. cleveland, professor emeritus of agricultural economics at mississippi state.   expanding federal mandates for ethanol prompted farmers to plant more corn to keep up with its growing role as an energy feedstock. also, new corn strains have made the crop more practical in mississippi's hot climate.  since 2003, cotton prices have declined nearly 23 percent, while prices for soybeans are up more than 38 percent and corn nearly 65 percent. cotton surpluses have been stacking up around the globe in part because of  rising yields from genetically modified cotton seeds and other technological improvements.  those trends are leaving farmers and cotton gin owners feeling pessimistic.  with the textile mills that make clothes ''leaving the country to where the labor is cheaper, it's not very smart to think we can grow the commodity here so they can make a shirt in china,'' said walter reese pillow iv. he followed in the footsteps of his father, grandfather and great-grandfather in growing cotton  -- until 2006, when he and his family converted their cotton fields to corn and soybeans.  ''the prospects for cotton coming back here are about as good as the mills coming back to south carolina,'' mr. pillow said.  jason colquett, owner of the crossroads gin, said his plant ginned 33,000 bales of cotton in 2006, 24,000 in 2007 and 15,000 in 2008. he does not expect to reach 10,000 this year. that has meant a loss of jobs, as it has at other gins across the state. mr. colquett's repair crew has dropped to four full-time workers, from nine, and his ginning season has been reduced to 30 days, from 90.  ''i can imagine mississippi without cotton gins,'' mr. colquett said. ''it's not a pretty picture.''",2009-05-06,recession

""these types of declines are unprecedented,"" says patrick farrell, enterprise’s vice president of corporate responsibility. the deepening ***recession** is prompting layoffs at long-established employers that avoided job cuts in previous downturns. these layoffs demonstrate both the severity of the current ***recession** and the continued erosion of workplace norms that once shielded many u.s. workers from permanent job loss. several of these employers are in hard-hit industries. employment in the car rental and leasing sector, for example, fell 3.3 percent in october from a year earlier, according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics. gentex corp., a zeeland, mich., automotive supplier, conducted its first layoffs in 34 years this month amid plunging car sales.  some workplace experts say such layoffs show that the stigma associated with permanent job cuts - unthinkable to many employers three decades ago - continues to decline. they say companies find it easier to let go of workers when rivals and other employers also are eliminating jobs. ""companies really respond to these things based on what they think they ought to be doing,"" says peter cappelli, director of the center for human resources at the university of pennsylvania’s wharton school. ""they watch what their competitors do and listen to what the investment community tells them."" kevin hallock, a professor at cornell university’s school of industrial and labor relations, says as layoffs become more common, managers may find it easier to discount the human and business costs. he recalls a group of senior executives who broke into tears after announcing their company’s first layoffs. when hallock returned to the company six months later, the same executives were discussing another round of job cuts in ""the starkest economic terms."" ""it was a really difficult thing for them the first time,"" he says. but ""they got over that hump."" many of the employers conducting their first layoffs say they first tried other ways to cut costs, such as freezing salaries or drumming up work for idle employees. enterprise managed to grow through past ***recession**s. its business, based largely on referrals from insurance companies, was mostly immune to volatility in airport traffic. but the  2007 acquisition of rival vanguard car rental group inc., parent of the alamo and national brands, increased enterprise’s stake in the airport rental market and added 10,000 employees, leaving the company more vulnerable to economic factors heading into 2008. for most of this year, closely held enterprise skirted the drop in rentals that hit some competitors as fuel prices climbed. but in its fiscal first quarter, which ended oct. 31, revenue at the st. louis company dropped 4 percent. enterprise initially slowed hiring, froze salaries and reduced overtime. in mid-october, chief executive andrew taylor urged employees in a company-wide e-mail to seek ""additional opportunities to reduce expenses."" two weeks later, with the prospect of further revenue declines, enterprise decided to close struggling branches, consolidate regional offices and dismiss hundreds of administrative and tech support staffers. ""this was not easy for us to do,"" farrell says. but ""in the end it’s better for our company and employees to make the difficult decisions today ... and ultimately protect the majority of jobs in the long term."" the ***recession** and tighter credit markets prompted the first-ever layoffs at life time fitness inc. by derailing expansion plans. the chanhassen, minn., fitness-center operator has grown rapidly, to 81 centers in 18 states, from 45 centers three years ago. this fall, though, life time fitness scaled back its planned 2009 expansion to six club openings, from 11. in november, the company laid off 100 of its 15,000 employees, primarily architects, designers and real-estate developers, says spokesman jason thunstrom. gentex, which makes rear-view cameras and other gear for cars and airplanes, earlier this month dismissed about 370 employees, or roughly 15 percent of its staff, in its first layoffs.

"245","7VT1-YNM0-Y8TC-S0PF-00000-00.txt","appliances -- big, sturdy labor savers -- seem like they should last forever. but according to data from consumer reports, at least a fifth of gas ranges, dishwashers and washing machines sold between 2003 and 2006 broke within three years. and pity the purchasers of side-by-side refrigerators with ice machines and dispensers: after three years, 37 percent of them needed service.  with 20.96 million major appliances shipped to retailers   in the united states in just the first four months of this year, that's a lot of broken products in america's future.   retailers and service technicians have long advised that it often makes sense to buy a new product rather than repair a broken one. they use the 50 percent rule: if a repair would cost half or more of what it costs to buy a new product, the product should be replaced. a new product is also likely to be more energy efficient.   but with the country deep in a ***recession**, repairmen say many consumers are rejecting this suggestion and, like their forebears during the depression, trying to spend as little as possible.  recently, sibylla waters,  46, a homemaker in odenton, md., who has two children living at home, hired landers appliance in baltimore to repair a plastic detergent dispenser on her roper dishwasher for $179, even though the machine is seven years old and could be replaced for about $400. since buying her home in 2005, she and her husband,  james, who works as a computer technician for the state,  have repaired a washer, a dryer and a water heater. why not keep this machine running, mrs. waters asks, ''especially if it will most likely last a few more years or so?'' besides, the couple already gave in once and bought a new dryer in february when repairing it seemed impossible.  ''they came out three different times and always had the wrong parts so i finally got fed up with it,'' she said.  kathryn harvey, 53, a mother of four who works as a toll collector on the new jersey turnpike, said that she bought a maytag washing machine five years ago that recently began ''screeching.'' although the repair, at $239 plus tax, is only about $150 less than a new machine, ms. harvey says every penny counts, particularly since her husband, a truck driver, had his workweek cut by one day. ''i have two sons in college already and my 18-year-old twins are going to college,'' she said. ''if i can milk the washing machine to make it work a little longer, talk to it and make it happy,  that's what i'm going to do. i need every cent.''  but getting anything repaired  can be frustrating. to stay profitable, service companies book multiple appointments on the same day, forcing consumers to sit home and  wait for hours. and because it would be impossible for technicians to drive around with every possible replacement part, some repairs require a follow-up visit that can be subject to the same inconveniences.  frustrated consumers have created web sites to vent. paul makulski, a 55-year-old accountant in waterloo, ontario, started such a site after trying to get electrolux to fix the handle on his frigidaire over-the-range microwave after he had already paid to repair it twice. ''i phoned electrolux, which wasn't easy, because their voice asks you to phone a different number, then that number tells you to phone a different number,'' he wrote in the site's inaugural complaint. ''then the person who answers the phone says to call back because everybody who knows anything is on lunch.'' mr. makulski was eventually told in an e-mail message, also posted, that the defect might be due to mounting the over-the-range microwave ''over a gas range.''  typically manufacturers outsource warranty service to another company, which subcontracts the actual work to a third party. so after contacting the manufacturer, consumers frequently find themselves calling yet another number, and then later, after the service call has been arranged, communicating with a third party -- who inevitably seems to have a different idea about when the work will be done and what the warranty covers.  appliance-repair rage has also driven at least one person, a 42-year-old woman in northern england who says she endured six months of rescheduled appointments and other delays, to hold a repairman hostage until he fixed her washing machine. ''i am not proud of what i did,'' tracey fox told the daily telegraph  in january, ''but it was the only way i was going to get something done.''   after the nightmare comes the bill. manufacturers intentionally charge a lot for replacement parts as a way of encouraging consumers to buy more products, said ronald sawyer, an appliance servicer in cohoes, n.y., and a founding member and executive director of the professional service association, an appliance repair industry group.   ''when manufacturers came up with a machine that retails for $400, that price covers all parts,'' he said. ''but when it breaks down and you needed a new timer, the timer alone could cost $250.  manufacturers create the technology when they design new machines, they control the manufacturing process, they make the replacement parts, so we're at the mercy of the manufacturers.''  lg electronics was the only one of the five biggest manufacturers to acknowledge that replacement parts can be costly. (general electric, electrolux and samsung all sidestepped the  question. whirlpool said it could not respond by press time.) john i. taylor, a vice president at lg electronics usa, said the reason parts can cost half or more of the price of the appliance is that ''there are thousands of specialized parts for appliance products -- maintaining inventories of replacement parts that may or may not get used can be costly.''  the complexity of warranties makes matters worse. years ago, most manufacturers gave warranties of at least two years. now, warranties on most midrange appliances are just one year,  say retailers and service providers. (boutique companies like sub-zero and miele typically provide coverage for longer periods.)  the best way to avoid the hassle of repair, according to numerous repairmen and consumer reports, is to buy the simplest possible appliance. ''the more doo-dads, the more stuff you add to an appliance, the more likely it's going to need a repair,'' said mark kotkin of consumer reports national research center. consumers would also be wise to recognize that the more sophisticated the equipment they buy, the more complicated -- and expensive -- the repairs can be.   still, few products will last as long as those made during the 1960s and 1970s. ''the old maytag washer your grandmother had, she bought that thing and used it for 35, 40 years,'' mr. sawyer said. ''it held up like nothing was ever going to go wrong with it. today, you just don't get that quality.'' ",2009-05-28,recession

neither have our institutions of higher education.richard j. sauerblue springs, mo.professors earn our payi am one of those professors who is  blamed for contributing to rising college costs. the false impression is that we do too little and earn too much. although i am in the classroom only seven hours per week this semester, teaching is only 10% of what i do.i publish only one  to two papers each year, but each usually represents three or four years of data collection.i also have a responsibility through the cooperative extension system to work with farmers throughout my state, and this requires considerable travel.i spend hours each week answering questions from the public in my area of expertise, at no charge. advising students, preparing for class, grading papers, writing grants, updating websites, writing reports, preparing presentations, acquiring supplies, and managing staff and a laboratory take considerable time.i, along with most of my colleagues, work 50 to 60 hours per week and rarely take vacations.most of my colleagues are extremely dedicated to their work and do far more than is recognized.there are other factors driving up costs. one is the desire to have better facilities in order to be more competitive for grants and for students.in addition, colleges must hire more administrative and support personnel to conform to ever-increasing regulatory demands.professors' salaries have not increased much more than the average household income over the past decade, and identifying them as the driver of high college costs earns a failing grade.marvin pritts, professordepartment of horticulturecornell universityithaca, n.y.taking colleges to taskit's about time a major u.s. news publication took universities to task for using tuition to rip off students for the past 30 years. as usa today's editorial indicated, too many universities and colleges, in the middle of an ***economic crisis**, continue to run their operations with a business-as-usual approach.tuition has risen well beyond inflation rates, with many rates as high as $40,000 a year. it's not uncommon to see tuition rates rise more than 10% in one year. those are obscene costs and a burden to the consumer.more disturbing, as tuition and book costs continue to rise, full-time professors actually spend less time in the classroom. usa today correctly points out that many professors spend fewer than 10 hours a week in the classroom.yet, they continue to get significant pay increases. the example cited in the editorial of the university of massachusetts planning to raise tuition and fees by a whopping 15% while raising faculty salaries is almost beyond belief.i would urge usa today to keep pursuing this issue. we have been ripped off by these academic thieves for much too long. it's about time someone took them to task.jerry komarcollingswood, n.j.invest in higher edusa today's editorial paints a severely distorted picture of the realities public colleges and universities are confronting in these harsh economic times.severe state funding cuts are profoundly affecting public schools nationwide. nevada gov. jim gibbons proposed a 36% cut for higher education. in washington, gov. christine gregoire proposed a 13% cut for the state university system.in new york, where the editorial notes there will be a tuition hike of 14% at the  state universities, gov. david paterson and the legislature decreed that 80% of tuition will be diverted to help pay for the state deficit, and only 20% will go to suny.rather than equipping labs and hiring faculty, institutions must use increased revenue primarily to meet inflation and offset the losses in state appropriations.tuition increases might not be popular, but they are necessary -- not so that  public colleges and universities can increase salaries, but so that they can make ends meet. funding cuts are exactly the wrong approach.public investment in higher education, especially in ***recession**ary times, is sound economic policy.shirley strum kenny, presidentstony brook universitylong island, n.y.",2009-04-03,c("economic crisis", "recession")

breeding, feeding and other practices to boost the milk output from each cow.for all of that, one brutal truth remains: when the supply goes up and demand goes down, the farmers take a hit.the past six months have been some of the worst on record, as the ***recession** sapped demand for dairy products around the world.\""i have never seen it this bad,\"" said mensonides, who has 450 cows near turlock. \""we have always had our ups and downs, but never as steep and dire as it is today.\""california farmers are getting about $1 per gallon of milk but face about $1.50 in production costs, according to the california department of food and agriculture. that's the price for the fluid market. milk bound for cheese and other processing plants goes for even less.the crisis could force 10 percent of the state's dairy farms out of business this year, western united dairymen estimated.\""it is a mess,\"" said michael marsh, chief executive officer of the modesto-based group. \""the market just disappeared with the global ***economic crisis**, and unfortunately for dairy producers, they can't simply turn the cows off to reduce the supply of milk.\""milk is the top farm product in the northern san joaquin valley, employing thousands of people on farms, at processing plants and in related businesses.tom marchy used to be one of them, running a farm in the waterford area. he said he saw disaster looming in the industry last fall and called it quits.his biggest customer, foster farms, had just canceled his milk contract and \""it was hard to find anyone else to ship to so i just got out,\"" marchy said.'it's a hard life'he sold his herd, about 1,100 black-and-white holsteins, to a farmer starting a dairy in oklahoma. he continues to tend some young cattle until they are milking age, then will be done with the business.\""this is a young man's game,\"" he said. \""unless you are big enough to hire people to do the work for you, it's a hard life.\""a year ago, the state's farmers enjoyed milk prices as high as $1.74 per gallon. overseas demand was strong and drought had reduced supplies from europe and new zealand, said rick kment, a dairy analyst for dtn, an omaha-based company that provides business information.farmers tend to respond to high milk prices by expanding their herds, he said. the number of milking cows on california farms went from 1.76 million in 2005 to 1.84 million last year, according to the u.s. department of agriculture.gross income to farmers shot up to $7.3 billion in 2007, when demand was strong enough to absorb the increased supply. the income dropped to $6.9 billion in 2008 as consumers tightened their spending and a surplus developed on the world market late in the year. this year looks to be much worse.meanwhile, many farmers have continued to milk their larger herds, trying to make what money they can but contributing to the glut.\""for many producers, reducing the cow numbers is one of the last options,\"" kment said.the industry took action earlier this year to deal with the surplus -- reducing the number of cows via sales to the beef market from farms that are shutting down.'unbelievable career wreck'collectively, u.s. farmers need to slash milk production by about 5 percent to bring supplies in balance with current demand, \""but we have no good mechanism to do that,\"" said geoffrey vanden heuvel, who owns dairy farms in southern california.\""this is an unbelievable career wreck,\"" he said. \""the amount of wealth being destroyed in this industry every week is just mind-boggling. the emotional toll this is taking is just amazing.\""industry people hope that prices will rebound in the coming months. some help could come from recently approved federal subsidies for dairy exports and increases in the use of dairy products in school meals and other nutrition programs.farmers have faced low prices before, but what's different this time is that their cost for feed and other expenses is high compared with their income, said bill schiek, an economist with the dairy institute of california in sacramento.\""they are just bleeding cash,\"" he said.mensonides, a board member with the dairy farmers of america processing cooperative, said farmers have tried to cut costs and seek help from lenders, but both have their limits.he said righting

"257","7W4N-DC01-2RG6-P00T-00000-00.txt","the relentlessly sanctimonious association of community organizations for reform now may not deserve its carefully cultivated image as a defender of the poor.that's because the group has become the leading cheerleader for a controversial real estate development that is slated to use eminent domain to remove the poor people it claims to represent.acorn, which has long prided itself on fighting the so-called gentrification of neighborhoods as rising property values force the poor to move, has also taken money from the project's developer and signed a binding agreement forcing it to stand behind the project no matter what.in the world of corporate shakedowns it is commonplace for liberal activist groups to use the money they extract from a supposed ""donor"" to fund operations, but it is very unusual for a group to take money in exchange for betraying those it is supposed to represent.but the far-left activist group acorn, which claims to defend the poor from what acorn ally rep. john conyers (d-michigan) last year called america's ""capitalist predators,"" is doing precisely that.in 2005, acorn signed an agreement with forest city ratner companies, llc, a megabucks real estate development firm, pledging its support for the ambitious atlantic yards development in brooklyn, new york.the taxpayer-subsidized 22-acre mixed-use project is currently expected to cost $4.9 billion. the sprawling complex would be built in the neighborhood of prospect heights and would include the barclays center, a proposed sports arena that would become the new home of the new jersey nets basketball team.in exchange for acorn's support, the developer agreed to set aside 50% of the expected 4,500 rental housing units for what the agreement's income tables define as ""affordable housing.""at a staged media event at brooklyn borough hall, acorn's bertha lewis publicly sealed the deal by planting kisses on the mouths of new york city mayor michael bloomberg and bruce ratner, ceo of the development company and principal owner of the money-losing new jersey nets.acorn hadn't wasted any time after the u.s. supreme court threw the door wide open for expropriation for private profit in the infamous kelo v. new london eminent domain case. the kelo decision was handed down june 23, 2005, and after the above-described bout of public osculation, the formal so-called community benefits agreement between acorn (and other local groups) and the developer was signed on june 27, 2005.without acorn's horse-traded support for the project, ""it was unlikely the atlantic yards deal would prevail,"" john atlas of the national housing institute wrote a few months later in shelterforce magazine. ""and if atlantic yards gets built, acorn will need all of its muscle to ensure that promises are fulfilled and the poor are protected.""it's worth noting that the venal acorn, which apparently supplied instant supporters for various public hearings on the project, and the government subsidy-seeking forest city ratner are a perfect fit for so many reasons.""we like working with acorn,"" an unnamed forest city ratner executive told the brooklyn paper in 2005. ""they have that radical feeling, they really fight for what they believe in. we just love their history, how they started, and feel it really represents what we're working to do here.""incidentally, left-of-center political activism runs in the ratner family.bruce, who used to teach law, ran the consumer protection division in new york city mayor john lindsay's administration. he was also consumer affairs commissioner under mayor ed koch. ""bruce is an old lefty, he's an old hippie,"" one friend told new york magazine. he also worked for the model cities program, an artifact of president lyndon johnson's ill-fated anti-poverty crusade.his brother is michael ratner, a che guevara admirer who has long campaigned for the closure of the u.s. military's guantanamo bay terrorist detention center in cuba. michael heads up the greenwich village-based center for constitutional rights, which has scored legal victories that undermined the global war on terror. their sister ellen is a left-wing journalist who said in 2002 it was ""my hope"" that president george w. bush ""messes up the war"" in iraq so he wouldn't be reelected in 2004.although in 2005, forest city ratner, struggling to move forward with atlantic yards, might have needed acorn more than acorn needed it, by 2008 the roles were reversed.stung by internal scandal, election fraud allegations galore, unprecedented nonstop negative media coverage, and cash flow problems, acorn agreed to accept a cash infusion from the developer.with millions of dollars in back taxes owing to the irs, states, and localities across the nation, acorn's continued backing for atlantic yards was apparently purchased for $1.5 million in 2008.according to documents posted online by acorn whistleblower anita moncrief, this bailout consisted of a $1 million loan and $500,000 in donations. the loan agreement stipulated that $500,000 would be paid to acorn upon signing and a further $500,000 would be paid out on oct. 1, 2008. a promissory note provided that interest would accrue at the rate of 4.58% with a final balloon payment of $100,000 due on may 31, 2011.forest city ratner indicated in a letter to acorn that it would disburse $500,000 in grants but the money wouldn't go to acorn directly. the grants were to be made to the acorn institute, one of acorn's 100-plus tax-exempt nonprofit affiliates.whether the money will stay at the acorn institute, which trains aspiring community organizers, is anyone's guess. acorn routinely shuffles cash around its network. its nebulous legal status and opaque corporate structure allow it to keep its activities largely hidden from public view.and there's a powerful financial incentive for acorn not to withdraw its support for atlantic yards. that's because the acorn institute was to receive $300,000 of the $500,000 grant up front, with the remaining $200,000 to be paid out in equal installments in august 2009 and august 2010.not surprisingly, as doubts have surfaced about whether forest city ratner will honor the promise it made to build 2,250 units of affordable housing -- the promise that helped it win the support of acorn and the prospect heights community -- acorn has remained silent.despite acorn's acquiescence, local politicians are becoming increasingly nervous about the affordable housing component of the project.""the sweeping promises of affordable housing made by the developer at the onset of this project have now evaporated to a mere whisper,"" assemblyman hakeem jeffries, a brooklyn democrat who backed the original plan, told the new york post last month. ""at this point, it is not clear that the developer plans to build anything other than an arena and a few affordable apartment units, and that is simply unacceptable.""although the officially approved plan called for 2,250 units of affordable housing to be built over 10 years, there is evidence that forest city ratner has been trying to renegotiate the deal for some time, noted an intrepid researcher named norman oder on a recent episode of cuny tv's ""brian lehrer live.""""in september 2007, before the ***economic downturn**, september 2007, the city and state signed funding agreements that require forest city ratner to build much, much less,"" said oder, who maintains the encyclopedic atlantic yards report blog. ""they can get away with building much less without penalty, maybe three towers, only 300 units of affordable housing in 12 years.""the idea that the developer would construct only three residential buildings was floated by bruce ratner himself. in a rare new york times report on the difficulties the project is facing, ratner said in march of last year that the bad economy and credit crunch were delivering a double-whammy to his plans. ""it may hold up the office building,"" he said. ""and the bond market may slow the pace of the residential buildings.""so in the developer's hierarchy of priorities, creating affordable housing seems to be far down on the list.""i would say their priority, clearly, is moving the new jersey nets, which they own in part, which are losing tens of millions of dollars a year, moving them from the izod center in new jersey to the so-called barclays center in brooklyn, where they'll have luxury suites, naming rights, they bring in new revenue, they stop losing and they can sell the team at a profit,"" oder said.a group of tenants, property owners, and business owners represented by south brooklyn legal services is fighting forest city ratner in court.in court documents they say that a state agency's study concluded that the project ""could indirectly eliminate 2,929 at-risk households (defined as 'privately held units that are unprotected by rent regulations, whose incomes or poverty status indicates that they could not pay substantial rent increases.')"" this means that ""nearly 3000 low-income households will be displaced in exchange for the ever-dwindling possibility that the project might create 2,250 'affordable' units -- a net affordable housing loss.""although the litigants in goldstein et al. v. empire state development corporation lost at trial, new york's highest court has agreed to hear an appeal in october. this will be cutting it close for the developer whose right to take advantage of tax-exempt financing for part of the project expires at the end of the year.if forest city ratner wins, acorn will bear partial responsibility for the roar of bulldozers in prospect heights.although acorn takes credit for saving residents of places such as hurricane katrina-ravaged new orleans from having their property taken by condemnation, the potential displacement of brooklyn residents doesn't seem to bother acorn's chief organizer bertha lewis. as recently as february, lewis patted herself on the back for her group's development work on the brooklyn project, which she described as ""sexy, sexy, sexy atlantic yards.""in the interview published in the current edition of regional labor review, lewis noted that when entering into talks with a developer, ""you really have to know your sh--.""""you need to be big enough and have the strength and have enough expertise and be able to bring the political capital to the table,"" she said.lewis may not be bothered by her conscience, but the displacement of property owners and poor people to make way for private developments does bother prominent acorn supporters.three months after the u.s. supreme court's widely condemned 2005 ruling that allowed revenue-hungry state and local governments to take private property and give it to private developers, lawmakers of every political stripe, including the very liberal rep. maxine waters (d-california), were incensed.waters, who frequently speaks at acorn events, said ""the taking of private property for private use, in my estimation, is unconstitutional. it's un-american, and it's not to be tolerated.""""this is not a partisan issue,"" she said of the ruling in the kelo v. new london eminent domain case.hilary o. shelton, director of the naacp's washington, d.c., bureau, pointed out that eminent domain has long been a favorite tool of officials who want to make way for city-planned renewal projects that force minorities out of communities.""the history of eminent domain is rife with abuse specifically targeting minority neighborhoods,"" he said. ""by allowing pure economic development motives to constitute public use for eminent domain purposes, state and local governments will now infringe on their property rights of those with less economic and political power with more regularity.""watchdog norman oder is upset that the new york times hasn't paid enough attention in his opinion to the atlantic yards story, especially with respect to forest city ratner's payments to acorn.he finds this lack of interest in the acorn bailout particularly troubling given the newspaper's dogged pursuit of the story of how the group covered up for eight years an embezzlement involving nearly $1 million by the acorn founder's brother, dale rathke.oder notes that the developer's payments constitute the second bailout of acorn. the first was covered in an august 16, 2008 times article about how drummond pike of the secretive tides foundation personally covered the remaining restitution payments that the rathke family was making to acorn.the old gray lady's virtual news blackout might stem from the fact that the new york times company and forest city ratner were development partners in the times company's newly constructed headquarters on eighth avenue in manhattan. eminent domain was used in the project.when the project was unveiled a few days after the 9/11 attacks, bruce ratner wrapped himself in the flag, saluting the newspaper's corporatist project as a ""very important testament to our values, culture and democratic ideals.""ironically, the new york times wasn't always enthusiastic about using the power of government to seize property. in a 1909 editorial, the newspaper railed against the income tax: ""when men get in the habit of helping themselves to the property of others, they cannot easily be cured of it.""acorn, which in theory is opposed to eminent domain abuse, isn't likely to be cured anytime soon.this article appeared on www.spectator.org.",2009-07-09,economic downturn

""i’m hoping everything comes out ok on that,"" said ward 7 alderman steven purcell.

""barbour added that more cuts to the fy10 budget were probable, if not all but guaranteed. that guarantee won't become until reality until at least oct. 23. last week, barbour ordered state department heads to prioritize their programs to guide him as he makes another round of budget cuts.""balancing the fy 2010 budget will likely require reductions of more than 5 percent,"" barbour said in a statement issued last week. ""to fully balance the budget through cuts, i would have to impose significant cuts to medicaid, as well as to other programs already cut by 5 percent or more in the fy 2010 budget itself. ""to comply with the 5 percent law, barbour's options are few. a few education line items - such as the $6,000 national board certification salary supplement for teachers, student financial aid and university of mississippi medical center's rural physicians scholarship - have not yet been cut 5 percent.the state's court system hasn't been cut 5 percent either, but based on chief justice bill waller's testimony before the joint legislative budget committee, in which he told lawmakers that the courts already don't have enough money to make it through the budget year, it seems unlikely the courts would be brought up to the 5 percent level.court-ordered settlements and debt service would also be held harmless.the two agencies who haven't been cut 5 percent, and that would probably have the most profound impact on mississippians, are the department of corrections and the division of medicaid. barbour went out of his way when he announced the $170 million in cuts to education that cutting the corrections budget would basically entail ""turning prisoners out on the street. "" commissioner of corrections chris epps declined multiple interview requests from the mississippi business journal.  division of medicaid director dr. robert robinson said keeping the dom's administrative costs as low as possible is the first step in holding expenses down.""it is important to keep in mind that our program's needs are partially driven by our state's economic environment,"" robinson said in an email. ""when our economy suffers, our program enrollment increases and costs increase accordingly.  much of that is out of our control. ""if the federal center for medicaid services (cms) approves the language of a bill the legislature passed in june, any deficit incurred in the medicaid budget would be made up of a combination of increased assessments on hospitals, a reduction in payments to providers or the transfer of money from the health care trust fund tobacco companies pay into as part of their settlement with the state. ""the objective is to avoid reductions in services to beneficiaries,"" robinson said.state economist phil pepper told the jlbc during the budget hearings late last month revenue collections will almost certainly continue to dwindle the rest of the fiscal year.""there will be little bounce to state and federal economies when recovery (from the national ***recession**) does occur,"" he said. recovery will be slow and steady. we've got hard times ahead.

morning.south carolina's high school assessment program serves two purposes: it tests whether students know enough to earn a diploma. also, federal education authorities crunch the scores to determine whether high schools are adequately preparing students for the future. that report, which falls under the no child left behind law, is scheduled to be released early next year.students take the two-part test, which includes a section on english language arts and math, during the first semester after their freshman year. students who don't pass take it again.here's how area high school students performed:rock hill--rock hill high: 80.2 percent of 478 test-takers passed both sections on the first attempt.--south pointe high: 77.7 percent of 327 test-takers passed both sections on the first attempt.--northwestern high: 75.2 percent of 463 test-takers passed both sections on the first attempt.fort mill--nation ford: 95 percent of 337 test-takers passed both sections on the first attempt.--fort mill high: 94 percent of 346 test-takers passed both sections on the first attempt.clover--clover high: 80.4 percent of 469 test-takers passed both sections on the first attempt.york--york comprehensive high: 73.7 percent 358 test-takers passed both sections on the first attempt.--york junior high: 25 percent of 4 test-takers passed both sections on the first attempt.statewide, the passing rate on south carolina's high school exit exam fell for the first time in four years.of the roughly 51,400 first-time test takers, 76 percent passed both the english and math sections. that's down from 81 percent in 2008, the state's best showing. the results match those posted in 2004, the first year for the revamped exit exam.school officials say the backward slide after three years of improvements is puzzling.whether it marks a downward trend or a \""random blip\"" won't be known until next year's results, said state schools chief jim rex. but he said he's concerned the dip is a symptom of budget cuts in education during the ***recession**.the cuts \""put pressure on schools just to maintain their core programs at a time when so many of our students have much greater needs,\"" he said.but a spokeswoman for the education oversight committee notes students took the test in the spring, before the brunt of the cuts took effect. if the budget cuts affect scores, then test results could continue to get worse, said dana yow.\""the results are discouraging, especially after the gains we've seen,\"" she said.students initially take the test in their second year of high school -- generally, their sophomore year -- and must pass to graduate. those who don't pass both sections have multiple chances to retake any part they failed. about half of states nationwide require students to pass a test to receive a diploma.broken down by subject, 80 percent of initial test-takers passed the math portion this year, down 4.4 percentage points from 2008, and 85 percent passed english, down 2.8 percentage points.the high school assessment program also is used to judge how well high schools are progressing on state and federal education goals.the tests are scored on a scale of 1 to 4. while the state considers 2 passing, federal evaluations are based only on the higher scores. the federal no child left behind law says all students must score 'proficient' or 'advanced' by 2014.students scoring at least a 3 declined from 56 percent in 2008 to 51 percent in math, and from 59 percent to 50 percent in english.the slides come in a year when the benchmarks ramp up for meeting federal education goals. that likely means significantly fewer schools will make \""adequate yearly progress.\"" that data is expected in january.the results were quickly highlighted by critics of public education. the president of a group that advocates legislation to help parents send their children to private school said parents should be worried.\""each and every child in south carolina deserves access to great classrooms, tailored instruction, and a meaningful diploma,\"" said randy page. \""no one's child should be a 'random blip.'\"" before 2004, south carolina high school students had to pass the basic skills assessment program to graduate -- a pass-or-fail test developed in the 1980s. the high school assessment program is based on the

''it goes really to the heart of what kind of society you want to have.''as opposed, collins noted, to the kind of society we've had under ''the bush-era tax cuts'' on everything from wealthy estates to capital gains and dividends to plain old six- and seven-figure salaries.collins' message: ''people who have achieved high accumulations of wealth should pay back the society that made it all possible.''so who exactly is this guy?for starters, he's a great-grandson of hot dog magnate oscar mayer who grew up in a world where money was never a problem. a world where talk of wealth-generated tax havens was ''part of the oxygen you breathe.''his childhood, collins said, ''gave me a good window into the nature of taxes and privilege.'' his conscience, on the other hand, constantly reminded him that ''i am so blessed'' as he graduated debt-free from pricey hampshire college in 1984 and embarked on a career dedicated to narrowing the ever-growing gap between the haves and the have-nots.hence, when collins inherited $500,000 from his great-grandfather's estate at the age of 25, he didn't run to the nearest high-yield, low-tax investment strategy. instead, he went looking for worthy charitable foundations - and gave every penny of the inheritance to them.and now, as a senior scholar at the washington, d.c.-based institute for public policy, collins argues that the ''organized complainers'' who howl at the mere mention of higher taxes for the rich do not reflect what all wealthy people feel these days.rather, he said, a ''silent majority'' of the wealthy understand that they've been pretty darned fortunate - maybe too fortunate - over the past decade as the wars in iraq and afghanistan, the worst ***recession** in half a century and a record-breaking federal deficit have left middle- and lower-income americans reeling.''we (people making more than $235,000 a year) got $700 billion in tax cuts from george bush since 2000,'' collins said. ''for a lot of us, the idea that we could get those cuts during a time of war is really unseemly. in all of our history, it's never been done before.''so now what?wealth for the common good's most immediate goal, collins said, is to persuade the obama administration to immediately rescind the bush tax cuts (which are scheduled to expire in 2011) on households that make more than $235,000 a year. doing so, he said, would pump $43 billion of much-needed revenue into federal coffers to help fund health care, education, green energy and transportation infrastructure.how well that message will play in maine depends, as always, on whom you ask.at the maine center for economic policy, which is sponsoring collins' appearance this evening, executive director christopher st. john calls collins ''one of the very, very few people who can actually talk about taxes in a way that makes sense to ordinary folks.''moving over to the right side of the political spectrum, chief economist scott moody at the maine heritage policy center would beg to differ.noting that many of those ''households'' that make over $235,000 are actually small businesses that can ill afford to pay more taxes, moody said collins' call for an early end to the bush tax cuts ''is like using a bazooka to kill a mouse.''''ideally, you want a flat-tax system where everyone pays the same rate,'' moody said.''in our opinion, that's the best way to level the playing field.''then there's andrew cadot, an attorney with perkins thompson in portland and one of a dozen mainers - out of more than 1,000 people overall - who have logged onto wealth for the common good's web site (www.wealthforcommongood.org) and signed the petition calling for obama to reset the tax code sooner rather than later.cadot said that while he's not one of the 225 (and counting) petition signers who now make more than $235,000 per year, his asset portfolio does put him in the ''top one percent'' of americans when it comes to net worth.and why did he sign?because, cadot said, it's high time that those with the most money in this country accepted their responsibility not just to themselves and their heirs, but to the society that helped put them where they are.''many of them can't possibly spend in their lifetime what they're carrying in their hip pocket,'' cadot said.right next to their anxiety pills.columnist bill nemitz can be contacted at 791-6323 or at:bnemitz@pressherald.com",2009-08-05,recession

""but that doesn't mean problem assets will become performing assets.""a moody's investors service report last week indicated that the worst is yet to come with respect to banks losing money on bad business, home and credit card loans.""there is a long way to go,"" said craig emrick, a vice president and senior credit officer there. ""we don't think we're close to a peak.""emrick estimates that the 66 banks he covers will lose $415 billion on bad loans in 2009 and 2010, including $70 billion charged off early this year.he predicts the banks are facing another $100 billion in residential loan losses, $73 billion in commercial mortgage losses and $41 billion in commercial and industrial loan losses.provisioning has not kept pace with rising nonperforming assets, emrick said. ""nonperformers translate into chargeoffs - they will need to continue to provision,"" emrick said. ""that is going to hurt their profitability significantly.""capital adequacythough the government signed off on the capital levels of the nation's biggest banks earlier this year, many other banks are likely to need more funds to make it through the ***recession**.robert albertson, the chief strategist at sandler o'neill &amp; partners lp, said $80 billion in capital was raised after the stress tests, but another $28 billion is needed to fortify the balance sheets of small and midsize banks.""there are 7,800 banks where the majority aren't there yet"" in terms of having adequate capital, albertson said. ""a significant amount of capital is still needed ... to keep the blood flowing.""fred cummings, president of the hedge fund elizabeth park capital management, was more optimistic - ""on balance i'd have to say the industry's capital position is in pretty good shape"" - but even he envisions more banks raising funds to prepare for repaying the troubled asset relief program.regulators could also spur a need for more capital. james rohr, chairman and ceo of pnc financial services group inc., said this week during a conference hosted by barclays capital that regulators may raise the threshold for being ""well capitalized"" to a tier 1 capital ratio of 9%, from the current 6%.fortunately for the industry, bank stocks have been rising, with the kbw bank stock index up 149% since march 6. several banking companies, ranging from regionals such as the $52.9 billion-asset zions bancorp. in salt lake city to the $1.56 billion-asset eagle bancorp of bethesda, md., have taken advantage, selling common stock in the past month.""capital raising has become less dilutive and more possible,"" said frederick cannon, co-director of research at kbw inc.'s keefe, bruyette &amp; woods inc. ""we've made a lot of progress in the last few months, particularly since the end of the second quarter.""no one knows how long the window may remain open or the degree to which investors will want to keep investing in bank stocks.""whether or not the window will remain open will be a function of the economy and credit quality,"" cummings said. ""healthy banks with nonperforming assets in line with expectations are having no problems raising capital. there is clearly a strong appetite for banks in that position.""deposit coststhe importance of deposit-gathering punctuates any conversation about the future of banking, but it is easier said than done.increased competition for deposits could drive up deposit costs faster than loan rates, squeezing margins, said novantas llc managing director sherief meleis.""historically, banks have been able to make a lot of money on deposits coming out of ***recession**s, because deposit pricing has lagged interest rate increases,"" meleis said. ""but what if this time there isn't much of a lag, because everybody is realizing the importance of deposits?""for every 10 basis points in deposit pricing that banks are not able to lag behind the latest fed interest rate increase, the industry collectively loses $5.5 billion in spread income, meleis said.on the flip side, $1.5 trillion in retail money market mutual funds is sitting with brokerages and other firms that banks may be able to poach, given the challenges to the money market mutual fund industry once the government stops guaranteeing such instruments, meleis said.another risk for deposit pricing - and margins - is additional special assessments or premium increases by the federal deposit insurance corp. as more banks fail, meleis said.moreover, the low yield curve will drive down the profitability from low-cost demand deposits, as banks won't do as well investing those dollars in securities, said aaron fine, a partner in the retail and business banking practice at oliver wyman group in new york.that means banks will need to rely more on income from loan yields, which carries increased credit risk if banks book a lot of risky but lucrative loans to generate more spread income, fine said.both meleis and fine pointed to another huge risk for banks: a substantial reduction in deposit fee income if congress or regulators crack down on overdraft fees.it is unclear how banks would replace that lost revenue, fine said.merger pitfallsconsolidation in the banking industry is inevitable, with some experts estimating that the number of u.s. banks could shrink from 8,000 to 4,000.the reasons for this are simple. after the ***recession** eases, banks won't be able to rely on the excessive leverage and exotic financial products that delivered eye-popping profits before the credit crisis. growth will have to come from buying other companies.and there will be plenty of opportunities to go shopping at bargain prices, as small and midsize banks confront troubled business and consumer loans through 2010 at the least. the healthier banks will be on the prowl for those with attractive deposits.but mergers are risky. recent history is rife with examples of buyers that overpaid, did poor due diligence or branched into an unfamiliar business line.""you're basically buying somebody else's problems,"" said mark fitzgibbon, director of research at sandler o'neill &amp; partners lp. ""it could be credit. it could be structural issues within the bank, particularly as we come out of this atypical credit period.""some industry watchers say consolidating the banking sector among several large, stable companies is healthy for the entire industry. they will be more likely to set rational lending and trading standards than the specialty finance companies and so-called shadow banks that ran rampant in the pre-***recession** days.but john jay, senior analyst with aite group, said there are systemic risks in consolidation.""you're actually, by this process, concentrating the risk,"" jay said, ""because you have fewer hands that are actually operating banks.""as they hunt for deals, fitzgibbon said banks need to move cautiously and do proper diligence.customer trustthough public anger at the banking industry over the ***financial crisis** has subsided, skepticism of what banks can really deliver persists, said michael d'esopo, senior partner at the new york brand strategy and design firm lippincott mercer.according to a lippincott survey of 1,004 bank customers released in july, respondents were still angry with ""wall street,"" but not necessarily at their own banks. in fact, 72% said ""trust"" is one of the emotions that best describe how they feel about their primary bank; 64% said ""loyalty"" and 48% said ""acceptance."" in contrast, only 5% said ""anger"" was one of the emotions, 3% said ""fear"" and 2% said ""rejection.""still, banks need to back up their reputations as safe havens with actions that demonstrate the customer truly comes first, or else customers won't buy it, d'esopo said.for example, he said, if a bank's brand touts its employees as friendly and approachable, the bank must ensure that its customer inquiry and dispute-resolution procedures at branches and call centers live up to those notions.""banks need to make sure they are delivering on their promises through interactions with customers, so superior customer experience is more than just a slogan,"" d'esopo said.customers want even greater control of their finances as a result of the ***financial crisis**, he said. banks that provide tools or instructions on how customers can make more informed financial decisions can reinforce trust, he said.banks should not get complacent just because many customers have stayed with them during the crisis, said dave martin, a retail banking consultant at ncbs, a unit of suntrust.""sometimes, banks lose sight that customers can and do vote with their feet, and so banks really need to step up their efforts to show customers just how much they appreciate them,"" martin said.les dinkin, a managing director at novantas llc, said banks can do everything right on one side of their business - say, in retail banking - but still suffer huge reputational hits overall if their earnings dive because of another side of their business. bad loans to residential developers, for example, have forced many banks to explain to customers why they should still be considered safe.""even if it's in just one part of the institution, it can affect the entire bank,"" dinkin said.attracting talentthe financial meltdown has created a recruiting challenge.lower earnings growth, heightened regulation, and more restrictions on compensation will hamper banking companies' efforts. the days of the huge signing bonuses are gone, observers say.rod taylor, the senior partner in the atlanta executive search firm taylor &amp; co., said banks will have to find new ways to compete for the best prospects. long-term viability will be a key selling point for companies that can be convincing, he said.""most banks realize they need energetic bankers if they want to be the big winners five years out,"" taylor said. ""our clients are confident the industry will come back, and when it does, there will be greater opportunities for those with the skills and the time left in their career.""robert voth, a partner in the financial services practice of the executive search firm ctpartners, said companies and job seekers have to take the view that the changing markets have an upside.""the disruption has provided multiple opportunities for companies to reinvent, reinvigorate and innovate their business approaches, processes and customer relationships,"" voth said.

[that]  will have a  great impact on many well-established  organizations.instead, their focus has been on  the innovative, the creative and  the new  all of which were blossoming  in the jewish community  when madoff was arrested and  the stock market took a dive.the most vulnerable jewish not-for-profits may be the more than  300 small independent jewish  organizations born in the past  decade that were counted by los  angeles-based jumpstart, one  of these small jewish organizations.  jumpstart describes itself  as a thinkubator of sustainable  jewish innovation.today's economic uncertainty  may signal the end for some of  these organizations. a few, like  jewish family &amp; life (jfl media),  have already dissolved.the climate could signal that  it will be harder than ever to get  people to be risk takers again,  hyman said.but others say that the world of  jewish not-for-profits has already  reached a tipping point in a shift  toward innovation, and that the  current climate may foster continued  change.marker, for one, thinks there  may be a continued blossoming  of innovative start-ups.since their overhead is smaller,  their dependence on a broad range  of support is less, they are often  exciting and can show immediate  success or failure, many funders  who see the difficulties of established  organizations may choose  to support these alternatives.a funder's money goes further,  the buy-in is less and the projects  are often higher energy. he continued,  saying when most organizations  are wringing their hands  about the past, the innovators are  envisioning a different future.this process had begun before  the ***recession**, but this may be a  case when the economic cutbacks  accelerate a process of innovation  and change rather than inhibit it.  build her own legacy.",2009-11-20,c("recession", "recession", "recession", "economic crisis", "recession")

""we are attentive to the implications of changes in the value of the dollar,"" bernanke said in rare remarks about the greenback. the fed, he said, will continue to ""monitor these developments closely."" commodity prices - such as oil - have risen lately. that pickup likely reflects a revival in global economic activity and the recent depreciation of the dollar, he said. despite ""cross-currents"" in the outlook for prices, he predicted inflation probably will remain ""subdued for some time."" that gives the fed leeway to hold rates at record-low levels for an ""extended period,"" bernanke said, repeating a pledge made at the fed's meeting earlier this month. the sagging dollar has helped sales of u.s. exports because it makes those goods less expensive on foreign markets. but if the dollar were to plunge in value, it could ignite a new ***economic crisis** in the u.s., prompting investors to dump their dollar holdings and driving up domestic interest rates.",2009-11-17,economic crisis
"286","7VY9-D7X1-2PBB-2524-00000-00.txt","le poisson rouge, the coolest place to hear contemporary music in new york, did little to celebrate its first anniversary on sunday night. a renovated bleecker street club, formerly the village gate, it presented a typically adventurous program. alarm will sound, the brilliant 20-member contemporary-music ensemble, conducted by alan pierson,  played five polystylistic pieces by the audaciously eclectic composer derek bermel, who draws from firsthand exposure to indigenous music of west africa and elsewhere.   john schaefer, the wnyc announcer, introduced the program, interviewed mr. bermel  and led a  round of applause for le poisson rouge, the only acknowledgment of its birthday. yet in just a year this black-walled greenwich village basement club, which presents all styles of contemporary music (classical, indie rock, jazz, electro-acoustic, ethnic), has become so essential to the new york music scene that it seems as if it had  been around  longer.   there are alternative sites for experimental contemporary music, like joe's pub and the cornelia street cafe in greenwich village, roulette in soho, barbes and the issue project room in brooklyn. but the programming of contemporary music from the classical tradition is especially lively at le poisson rouge.   a ''multimedia art cabaret,'' as the club bills itself, le poisson rouge was founded by david handler, a violinist and composer, and justin kantor, a cellist, who began envisioning an alternative space for new music when they were students at the manhattan school of music. they were exasperated with the traditional concert setting, with its ''preacher and congregation seating,'' as the lanky, bearded mr. handler, 28, said in a recent interview.   ''our mission here has been to foster a more symbiotic relationship between art and revelry,'' he said. ''only in recent history have art and revelry diverged,  and both are suffering from the breakup.''  i made my first visit to the club in october, when the dynamic jack quartet played the complete string quartets by the thorny modernist iannis xenakis, who died in 2001. i never expected to hear these hard-driven, complex pieces played in a single program, let alone at a club before a packed house of mostly young people, sitting at tables and sipping drinks. le poisson rouge relies on food and beverages to turn a profit. its motto: ''serving art and alcohol.''   the barely known xenakis quartets might have seemed a hard sell. but the club routinely attracts listeners curious about any kind of out-there contemporary music. the jack quartet certainly gets around the club scene in new york. a  concert for its new recording of the xenakis quartets on the mode label will take place on july 5 at joe's pub, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year.  last month at le poisson rouge i was exhilarated to hear a vibrant performance of schoenberg's ''pierrot lunaire,'' a path-breaking atonal score from 1912. schoenberg's music is still stigmatized and feared by conservative segments of the classical music audience. so you can imagine how gratified the composer would have been to hear this fresh, keenly dramatic account of ''pierrot lunaire'' presented at an informal club for an eager and receptive audience.  in a compelling performance, the veteran soprano lucy shelton was joined by five accomplished young instrumentalists from the ensemble acjw, part of the training academy run jointly by the juilliard school and carnegie hall, in partnership with the new york city department of education.   in many ways the club was an ideal place to hear schoenberg's seminal piece. ''pierrot lunaire,'' a setting of german translations of 21 french poems by the symbolist belgian writer albert giraud, came out of the berlin cabaret tradition. it was written for a noted actress, albertine zehme, who performed it in a pierrot clown costume. schoenberg composed the solo part in a sprechstimme style, half spoken and half sung. ''pierrot lunaire'' may be a formidable modernist score, but it is also a dramatic recitation with weirdly mesmerizing music.   given the dismaying lack of knowledge about classical music among young audiences today, le poisson rouge and similar alternative sites are making a virtue of necessity. if you program xenakis and schoenberg alongside indie rock and experimental jazz, you are inviting audiences to put aside preconceptions and respond instinctively to everything.   mr. kantor and mr. handler are not enemies of categories. they acknowledge that different styles of new music come from different traditions, and they cede most of the programming decisions to a roster of experts, among them ronen givony, who lines up classical contemporary ensembles. yet stylistic categories of modern music are blurring as never before.   take indie rock. ''these days the pieces are longer, there is less emphasis on words and a more experimental approach to instrumentation,'' mr. handler said. so why not mix it up?  on wednesday night audiences at le poisson rouge can hear dinosaur feathers, browns and pow wow!, three indie rock and pop groups. but on monday the contemporary ensemble signal plays steve reich's double sextet, and on tuesday the pianist aki takahashi plays works by morton feldman, giacinto scelsi and that poisson rouge regular, xenakis.   there is no set arrangement for paying performers at le poisson rouge. depending on circumstances and the clout of the artists, some receive guaranteed fees. others take a percentage of the receipts, or a combination of the two. a group can clear from $100 or less to $1,000 or more, mr. handler said.   with the severity of the ***recession**, le poisson rouge and similar clubs are at least offering artists, especially younger ones, an outlet. but another way to look at it is that these clubs are benefiting from the ***economic downturn**, which is leaving performers eager for any exposure. still, at every concert i have attended at le poisson rouge, the classical performers have seemed elated to be reaching new audiences in this unconventional and liberating setting.  on monday night the pianist bruce brubaker, who has championed minimalist and post-minimalist composers, played a solo program of subdued works drawn from his new recording, ''time curve'' (arabesque). he opened with ''the time curve preludes,'' book 1, by the american composer william duckworth. written in the late 1970s, these pieces subtly combine haunting repetitive patterns with hints of diverse musical idioms, like scat singing, bartok dances and medieval chant.   as mr. brubaker explained to the audience, the preludes require the performer to place narrow metal weights on various keys in the piano's low register. this lifts the dampers on the selected notes,  allowing the strings to resonate sympathetically as nearby keys are struck, creating a backdrop of continuous, softly droning sound.   mr. brubaker concluded his program with sensitive performances of ruminative pieces by philip glass: the etude no. 5 and ''metamorphosis two.'' when the undulant chord patterns of the final work faded away, a rapt audience let the silence linger, then broke into whoops and cheers. one person shouted, ''thank you.''  a good start to year 2 at le poisson rouge.",2009-06-17,c("recession", "economic downturn")

"288","7VY9-BXB1-2PB4-7193-00000-00.txt","the obama administration last night detailed a series of proposals to involve the government more deeply in private markets, from helping to steer borrowers into affordable mortgage loans to imposing new limits on the largest financial companies, in a sweeping effort to curb the kinds of reckless risk-taking that sparked the ***economic crisis**.the plan seeks to overhaul the nation's outdated system of financial regulations. senior officials debated using a bulldozer to clear the way for fundamental reforms but decided instead to build within the shell of the existing system, offering what amounts to an architect's blueprint for modernizing a creaky old building.the white house makes its case for this approach in an 85-page white paper that describes the roots of the crisis. gaps in regulation allowed companies to make loans many borrowers could not afford.  funding came from new kinds of investments that were poorly understood by regulators. big firms paid employees massive bonuses, while setting aside little money to absorb potential losses.""while this crisis had many causes, it is clear now that the government could have done more to prevent many of these problems from growing out of control and threatening the stability of our financial system,"" the white paper says.the plan is built around five key points, according to a briefing last night by senior administration officials and a copy of the white paper obtained by the washington post.the proposals would greatly increase the power of the federal reserve, creating stronger and more consistent oversight of the largest financial firms.it also asks congress to authorize the government for the first time to dismantle large firms that fall into trouble, avoiding a chaotic collapse that could disrupt the economy.federal oversight would be extended to dark corners of the financial markets, imposing new rules on trading in complex derivatives and securities built from mortgage loans.the government would create a new agency to protect consumers of mortgages, credit cards and other financial products.and the administration would increase its coordination with other nations to prevent  businesses from migrating to less regulated venues.president obama is scheduled to announce the full plan today, ending months of political calibration and internal discussion and dropping the details into an already-heated debate on capitol hill.  congress is scheduled to hold its first hearings on the proposals tomorrow, and interest groups already are ramping up their campaigns. congressional leaders say they hope to pass some version of the plan by year's end.""speed is important,"" obama said yesterday in an interview aired by cnbc. ""we want to do it right. we want to do it carefully. but we don't want to tilt at windmills. we want to make sure that we're getting the best possible regulatory framework in place so that we're not repeating the mistakes of the past.""the administration already has hammered out a number of compromises with key democrats in congress, in hopes of creating a proposal that can survive the challenge from competing interests such as hedge funds hoping to avoid regulation  and consumer groups seeking even greater protections. but while the proposals sharpen the discussion about reform, they don't end it.""with their proposals today, the administration has moved this critical debate from broad discussion to specific action,"" said timothy ryan of the securities industry and financial markets association.the administration's plan leans heavily on the fed, expanding its role as the regulator of the nation's largest banks such as j.p. morgan chase and goldman sachs to include other giant financial firms, such as the insurance companies american international group and metlife. the agency, which has greater independence from the political process than other regulators, would have broad authority to impose special requirements on those companies, such as mandating that they set aside a larger percentage of their assets against possible losses than smaller firms. such a requirement could limit large companies' appetite for risk, but also their profit and growth.the plan calls for a council of regulators to consult with the fed, including the treasury secretary and the heads of the other financial regulatory agencies: the securities and exchange commission, commodity futures trading commission, the federal housing finance agency and the agencies that regulate banks. a primary task of the council would be to recommend which large, globally interconnected firms are too big to fail and should be subject to more rigorous oversight. but the council will not have the authority to oppose decisions made by the central bank.agencies other than the fed pressed for the creation of such a council, but its limited role is likely to disappoint them. prominent democrats and republicans in congress also have signaled that they are reluctant to increase the fed's powers without imposing stronger limitations.a second element likely to provoke fierce debate is the establishment of a consumer financial protection agency.the agency would have broad authority to overhaul a tangled mess of federal regulations, such as the various laws that compel lenders to give mortgage borrowers a massive stack of paperwork at closing that includes several calculations of the true cost of the loan itself.""consumers should have clear disclosure regarding the consequences of their financial decisions,"" the plan states.the agency also would have the authority to change the way that loans are sold. one idea highlighted by the administration is to require that lenders offer all customers standard ""plain vanilla"" loans, such as 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages with streamlined pricing. the sale of loans with more complicated terms would be subjected to greater scrutiny by the agency. it could even require that customers who take more complicated loans sign a waiver.and the agency would have a mandate to increase the availability of financial products in lower-income communities and other underserved areas, in part by enforcing the community reinvestment act, which requires banks to make loans everywhere that they collect deposits.to carry out these responsibilities, the agency would be granted the same powers as the regulators charged with keeping banks healthy, including the ability to write rules, conduct examinations, and impose fines and other penalties.regulatory agencies and industry groups acknowledge failures in recent years. but they say the existing model remains the best way to protect consumers, arguing that the agencies can identify problems more easily because of their close engagement with firms. they also are concerned that a consumer agency could be overly restrictive, limiting access to loans and constraining the development of new types of accounts, loans and other financial services.""this consumer protection agency would be deciding how people get to live as opposed to people getting to decide for themselves,"" said kelly king, chief executive of bb&amp;t, a large commercial bank based in north carolina.consumer advocates say the current ***financial crisis** is ample evidence of the need for a new approach.""we've tried it the other way for years, and obviously it didn't work. that's how we got here,"" said john taylor of the national community reinvestment coalition.several ideas have been dropped as the administration picks its battles. the plan will not include a new way of regulating insurance companies at the federal level.  the insurance industry, which is regulated at the state level, is deeply divided, and the white house  anticipated a distracting fight. the administration instead plans to create an office in the treasury department to monitor the insurance industry.some of the largest insurance companies could still fall under the scrutiny of the federal reserve in its new role as a systemic risk regulator.the administration had earlier backed away from a proposal to merge the two agencies that oversee financial markets, and to merge the four agencies that regulate banks. it still will seek to merge the office of thrift supervision and the office of the comptroller of the currency to create a single agency to oversee banks with national charters. it also will propose eliminating the regulatory category for thrifts, traditionally defined as banks that focus on mortgage lending.steve adamske, spokesman for the house financial services committee, said committee chairman rep. barney frank (d-mass.) plans to launch hearings on the specific proposals

""good policy changes could put off the next [bubble] by 50 to 75 years, instead of five or 10,"" he said.asset bubbles date to the 1600s.during holland's ""tulip mania"" in the 17th century, the slender flower became a status symbol and sparked a brief but ruinous bubble that saw tulip bulbs sell for as much as the price of a house before the market crashed. in the late 1800s, shares of u.s. railroads soared and crumbled. and just a few decades later, after the birth of the u.s. auto industry helped pump up the economy - and home prices - the stock market made its historic ascent and 1929 crash, triggering the great depression.from world war ii up until the 1980s, large-scale asset bubbles in the u.s. were rare.world economies were tightly regulated and the flow of international capital was restricted, making it much harder for bubbles to form, says carmen reinhart, an economics professor at the university of maryland.it's a vastly different picture today. international financial markets have become deeply enmeshed, and the cross-border flow of money has ballooned, making the u.s. economy ""much more crisis prone,"" reinhart says.it's true that credit is harder to come by today and that could temper the threat. but until lending standards are further tightened, a ""misalignment"" between the risks and rewards of investing with borrowed money will persist, says mark t. williams, professor of finance and economics at boston university.the obama administration is calling for tougher measures against subprime lending to ensure that only qualified borrowers get loans. it also has proposed limiting executive pay to discourage excessive risk-taking and making banks keep more capital on their books to safeguard against risky borrowing, or leverage.harrison hong, an economist at princeton university who researches bubbles, says the same short-term mind-set that prods investors to pile into the next boom also allows them to forget the previous bust.after the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000, it only took a few years before the same investors who lost money on internet stocks turned their attention to real estate as home prices rose rapidly. ""memories are fairly short,"" hong says.

"299","7WF5-GKW0-Y8TC-S05P-00000-00.txt","''thirtysomething'' arrived on network television in september 1987, 20 days before black monday, when the dow jones industrial average dropped nearly 23 percent, and the culture of yuppiedom, put to the series's meticulous dramatic scrutiny, seemed threatened with dissolution.   what could have proven ruinous for the show's producers and the american economy at large turned out to be less perilous than initially imagined. the ***recession** that followed was brief, and the boomer values that bolstered the world of reeboks, oversize horn rims and jane fonda gym clothes were strong enough to sustain ''thirtysomething'' for three subsequent seasons, until the near end of the bush presidency in 1991.  created by marshall herskovitz and edward zwick, ''thirtysomething,'' whose debut season will be available on dvd for the first time on tuesday, illuminated the escalating culture wars without ever fully capitalizing on mounting tensions. the show was never watched as much as it was debated, worshiped, maligned and endlessly dusted over for markers of social and psychological relevance. (in 2007 it became the subject of a short book aspiring to academic pretension: ''thirtysomething: television, women, men, and work.'') broadcast on abc, it never made it into the nielsen top 20. the show achieved its highest rating during the first 15 minutes of the premiere.  and yet ''thirtysomething'' has become such an ingrained part of late 20th-century popular culture for a certain type whose tastes were perfectly synchronized to clinton liberalism. for the benefit of anyone who might have missed the historic significance of the volvo in american consumer life, ''thirtysomething'' revolved around a good-looking ad man, michael steadman (ken olin); his stay-at-home wife, hope (mel harris); and the group of self-analyzing friends around whom the couple formed a family more emotionally grounded than the ones they'd come from.   until ''thirtysomething'' babies were virtually absent from the landscape of serial television, and it is the show's examination of the nascent obsession with child care that remains its most prescient and meaningful legacy. hope and michael have a daughter, janey, whose smeared face is ever present and whose burps, wails and gurgles function in some sense as the series soundtrack (as they remain a recurring threat to her parents' attempts at coital happiness). in an early scene in the first episode michael shops for baby gear in a moment that foretells what will be a resonant fixation of affluent parents for the next 20-plus-years: stroller pricing. (he is aghast at the $278 cost, not realizing that the future will bring, among other questionable advancements in child transport, the $1,029.99 bugaboo cameleon denim.)  although the show spoke exclusively to the interests of its privileged and therapeutically inclined audience, it managed  endlessly to offend members of its own constituency, particularly feminists appalled by hope's relationship to motherhood. ''thirtysomething'' was accused of traditionalism, but it never seemed to benefit from the backlash. hope opted to run a household, but she was never honored with a luncheon given by the eagle forum.  on the series she is a princeton graduate who had been on her way to becoming a kind of journalistic ralph nader until she gave birth. hope's devotion to her daughter is fetishistic and sometimes hysterical, a factor heightened by ms. harris's acting style, which often lacks the modulation of her more gifted colleagues. in the early episodes hope can't leave her child for a weekend, or even six minutes, and any efforts to find a baby sitter only turn up candidates who seem to be sadists, addicts or lunatics.  susan faludi was one of the many who faulted the show for its perceived exaltation of motherhood, but the criticism doesn't easily hold. hope's ambivalence about having left her professional life is palpable, and her responsibilities often unravel her. at the same time her friend nancy (patricia wettig), the wife of michael's business partner, is rewarded for her unwavering attention to her family with an unfaithful husband and a body later ravaged by chemotherapy. she isn't given just any random malignancy but, rather symbolically, the deadliest gynecological cancer of all: ovarian.  visually ''thirtysomething'' was committed to depicting the disorder and mess of marital life. the steadmans' arts and crafts house needs constant renovation; space is cramped; hope's clothes never seem to make it to the laundry, the yogurt and gerber stains always visible. not since ''all in the family'' has a series been as intent on reproducing the sound of a toilet flushing.  ''thirtysomething'' came a decade after ''looking for mr. goodbar'' and 11 years before ''sex and the city,'' and while its evocation of single life feels archaically sandwiched between those two touchstones, it is impossible to watch the series and think that it glamorized marriage as a sacrosanct alternative. in the show's mind, adulthood was its own bittersweet torture no matter what domestic form it took.  while the unmarried on ''thirtysomething'' endured their share of abjection -- at one point melissa (melanie mayron), a talented photographer, is rejected by a potential blind date when he spots her through his apartment video monitor -- within the context of '80s television the show's view of professional women can only be regarded as progressive. even on acclaimed series praised for verite portrayals of urban life, competent professional women suffered despite great reserves of strength. on ''l.a. law'' grace van owen (susan dey) was given a nervous breakdown; dr. wendy armstrong (kim miyori) of ''st. elsewhere'' killed herself after she couldn't save a child's life; others were saddled with breast cancer, infertility, divorce, loneliness. by the time ''thirtysomething'' came to a close, both melissa and hope's best friend, ellyn (polly draper), a single urban planner, had found endings that did not solicit our pity.   ellyn didn't make a fortune working for the city of philadelphia, where ''thirtysomething'' is set. and it is that distance, far enough away from the money culture of new york and ''wall street'' (which also appeared in 1987), that allowed the show's principals to remain largely untouched by the untrammeled ambition that distinguished the era.   michael's friend gary (peter horton) is a professor of english at the university of pennsylvania who doesn't get tenure and doesn't much mind. michael is in advertising only because he never found a way to become john irving, and the company he starts with his friend elliot (timothy busfield)  is never in danger of putting j. walter thompson out of business. the period in which advertising was the reigning profession of america's ruling class is over, and michael is just another middle-class schlub, don draper's reluctant descendant.  when ''thirtysomething'' appeared, it was thought to have inaugurated, along with a handful of other network series, a new golden age of television. that age would not actually come until the late '90s and the hbo revolution, and it seems unfair to watch the show against the backdrop of all that has evolved since.   ''thirtysomething'' often felt like real life, but it also deployed, and even developed, what would become some of the most regrettable conventions  of network storytelling: goofy fantasy sequences, music intended as emotional cues, pointless flashbacks (in this instance, those that remind us that during the late '60s people had long hair and congregated around vans). ''thirtysomething'' wasn't great television, but it was very good television, and when it ended, many of us felt as if we were losing something -- not art, but something less abstract and more personal. the '80s weren't all a misery.
