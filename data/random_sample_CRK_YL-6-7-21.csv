""we have a lot of people struggling to get by in an area where living costs are high, and they're not able to get coverage. so they just don't get care at all.""shell said the county is considering opening a primary-care clinic at the county hospital, where the uninsured could seek care for one-fifth the cost of going to the emergency room.costs have waylaid many a plan.only an infusion of $1.2 million in federal stimulus money kept the prince william community health center from closing its doors. the center served 6,000 people last year, director liz sykes said. many are jobless or uninsured working poor who have part-time or entry-level jobs. at the free clinic, which is open two nights a week, schuler said she has seen more homeless patients in the past seven months than in the previous 15 years.montgomery set an ambitious goal of caring for 40,000 uninsured residents -- half the estimated total -- at a network of ""safety net"" clinics. five years later, the county is halfway there and the clinics have waiting lists.county council member george leventhal (d-at large), who heads the panel's health and human services committee, said most of the uninsured are working-class people and recent immigrants. council member duchy trachtenberg (d-at large) said a growing number are divorced women 55 to 64. many forgo health insurance in the face of more pressing needs.""the cost of living is so high,"" leventhal said. ""if you're making discretionary decisions, you pay the rent or groceries or health insurance.""the district boasts the most comprehensive health coverage in the region -- and some of the biggest health challenges. it has the region's highest rates of low birth  weights, premature births, breast cancer, heart disease and aids, for example.julie hudman, head of the city's health care finance department, said the district has fewer uninsured adults because of its high eligibility levels. its healthcare alliance program covers almost 55,000 adults who make up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or $36,620 for a family of three. fully a third of the adults in the city are covered under alliance or medicaid.under alliance, patients have no premiums and no cost sharing. prescription drugs cost the patient $1. everyone is eligible, including newly arrived and undocumented immigrants.""our goal is to have everyone covered,"" hudman said. a survey is being done to determine why some people haven't enrolled.woodward, who headed the cog study, said hospitals are providing a lot of primary care that the clinics cannot handle, particularly in emergency rooms.""having a fifth of adults without health insurance is a huge problem,"" he said.

4SKJ-MNP0-TWX3-K0WW-00000-00.txt,"what would it take to stop the madness of rising oil prices? shocking increases in crude-oil costs - which spiked above $135 a barrel at one point last week - are now pushing airlines and truckers to the brink, forcing many consumers to say they are staying home this holiday weekend, and recharging fears of ***recession** in the face of $4-a-gallon gasoline. it's a supply-demand problem on steroids. here are five possible solutions, along with the outlook for each. solution no. 1:  reduce world demand for oil. outlook: very unlikely. but oil supplies haven't changed much over the last five years, so why not simply throttle back demand? well, who isn't trying? hybrid cars and fluorescent bulbs help. but as the saying goes, the genie is out of the bottle. oil demand, particularly from china, continues to skyrocket. at the same time, efforts to switch to alternative fuels continue to stumble - and are short-term losers. converting corn to ethanol is making food more expensive, and scarce, some experts say. building more nuclear power stations would take years. solar and wind power? planners are just waking up to the huge amounts of real estate the current technologies would consume to reach meaningful outputs. solution no. 2: pump more  oil out of the ground. outlook: not likely for decades. the international energy agency, which is based in paris, said last week that oil companies might be incapable of keeping up with demand for the next 20 years. the opec oil cartel is disinclined to try harder, and some of its officials even question whether there is a supply shortage. on thursday, opec secretary-general abdullah al-badri pointed a finger at market speculation and the weak dollar to explain high crude prices. ""even if we increase output tomorrow, the prices will not come down, because of speculation and because of a weak dollar,"" he said. ""when we see there is a shortage of supply, we will act."" solution no. 3: pop the speculation bubble. outlook: try changing human nature. if wild speculation is the problem, let's round up those naughty traders and bus them to chester and bensalem to bet the slots and ponies instead of the price of a barrel of crude. but then what? speculators, who never intend to take possession of a barrel of oil, are simply paying what they think that barrel will be worth at some future date. they're taking into account all the same fundamental factors that have propelled the price of oil up for the last six years. solution no. 4: strengthen the weak dollar. outlook: this could happen in coming months. the federal reserve has signaled that it doesn't see further interest-rate cuts for now, and opec president chakib khelil told reuters last week that a 10 percent gain in the dollar probably would result in a 40 percent drop in oil prices. this is largely because oil futures are traded in dollars, and a weak dollar makes oil less expensive to buyers dealing in other currencies. meanwhile, the price of oil has tended to slip on any day that the dollar strengthens against the euro. economists still disagree, though, on how best to shore up the dollar and about what effect that would have on the overall economy. instead, the fed has been trying to stave off ***recession** and solve a credit crisis by lowering key interest rates. solution no. 5:  a big, bad ***recession**. outlook: sadly, this could happen, regardless of the efforts of the fed, stimulus checks and anything else. and it is oil that could finally tip the economy into ***recession**. experts say gasoline prices have yet to catch up with the spike in crude, and $200-a-barrel oil, which some officials say is possible in the next two years, could cost $6 per gallon at the gas pump. chances are, that'll do the trick. contact staff writer reid kanaley at 215-854-5114 or rkanaley@phillynews.com.

7WJW-JF81-2RG2-N0NF-00000-00.txt,"ethan b. kapstein holds the insead chair in political economy at insead in fontainebleau, france, and is a visiting fellow at the center for global development, in washington, d.c. he is the author, with nathan converse, of the fate of young democracies. in one of the great ironies of history, africa may well emerge from the current global ***recession** as the only region in the world that remains committed to global capitalism. while the tired industrialized nations of the west are nationalizing their banks and engaging in various forms of protectionism, africa remains open for business -- promoting trade, foreign direct investment, and domestic entrepreneurship. analysts in the industrialized countries are concerned that foreign aid flows to africa might drop because of the ***recession**, but africans themselves are much more worried about rising barriers to their exports and diminishing private investment from abroad, which could impede the continuation of the impressive economic progress the continent has made over the past decade. it is still a well-kept secret that the african continent has been in the midst of a profound economic transformation. since 2004, economic growth has boomed at an average level of six percent annually, on par with latin america. this rate will undoubtedly decline as a result of the global ***financial crisis**, but the international monetary fund still projects growth of around 1.5 percent for this year and four percent for 2010 throughout africa -- a relatively healthy figure by today's depressing standards. international trade now accounts for nearly 60 percent of africa's gdp (far above the level for latin america), and foreign direct investment in africa has more than doubled since 1998, to over $15 billion per year. overall, private-sector investment constitutes more than 20 percent of gdp. furthermore, since 1990, the number of countries with stock markets in sub-saharan africa has tripled and the capitalization of those exchanges has risen from virtually nothing to $245 billion (that is, outside of south africa, which has long had an active stock exchange). these ""frontier"" markets have, until recently, given investors huge returns compared to those found in other emerging economies. but these positive trends may not last. bad governments in africa -- often tribal in their orientation, with kenya being a notable example -- have long rewarded insiders and engaged in widespread corruption and often even the outright theft of national resources. in such regimes, military officials and dictators have generally monopolized economic activity, providing few, if any, incentives for legitimate entrepreneurs to do business. it comes as no surprise that under these circumstances africa suffered from low growth rates and high levels of poverty. far-reaching political changes since 1990, however, have played a crucial role in africa's capitalist revolution. with the tragic exception of zimbabwe, one finds widespread progress alongside the economic transformation. in january 2009, ghana held a crucial presidential election that led to its second peaceful transfer of power in a decade, an event that was widely celebrated across the continent. even where democracy remains fragile, as in kenya, leaders understand that the old patrimonial ways of doing business are becoming increasingly costly to maintain. anticorruption commissions of varying degrees of effectiveness are springing up in a growing number of countries, with cameroon being one example. citizens are also demanding more competent leaders who are capable of governing modern societies integrated into a global economy. for example, after being democratically elected in 2006, the president of benin, thomas yayi boni, emphasized that his cabinet would consist of ""technocrats,"" recruited from universities and development banks. and in liberia, a former world bank official, ellen johnson-sirleaf, became president in 2006. but given the continent's many chronic problems, these changes are not necessarily durable, and they could easily be reversed by the current crisis and rising protectionism in the west. if africa does not do more to encourage entrepreneurship, and if the current great ***recession** leads to a significant reduction in foreign capital flows and higher trade barriers in the united states and western europe, then the region's nascent capitalist revolution could meet an untimely demise. the twilight of afro-pessimism during the 1990s, just as africa was laying the groundwork for its current growth spurt, many western experts and policymakers were busy writing off the continent's future. but the generalized failure to predict africa's capitalist revolution should come as no surprise. the end of the cold war meant that africa was no longer a focal point for the u.s.-soviet struggle, and the continent lost the strategic significance it had once enjoyed. oil prices were low, and the region's economies seemed hopeless. they were commodity- and aid-dependent at a time when the revenue streams from each of these sources were falling, and they were mired in billions of dollars of debt to western governments and banks. to the extent that anyone cared about africa, it was the foreign aid community. donors and humanitarian organizations -- driven in part by a desire to ensure continued flows of foreign aid -- painted a relentlessly bleak picture of a region beset by hunger, disease, violent civil conflict, huge debt burdens, and corrupt and dysfunctional governments. yet behind this façade, africa's economic potential was stirring. at home, africa was urbanizing and democratizing, and internationally, the continent was opening up to global trade, forcing its economies to become more competitive. together, these changes provided the background conditions for the region's capitalist revolution. urbanization is one trend that development economists seem to ignore when making their forecasts. that is striking, because more than 30 percent of all africans now live in cities -- up from 15 percent in 1965 -- a number that should rise to over 50 percent of the population in the next 20 or 30 years (a percentage comparable to that in asia, a region that most people think of as exceptionally urbanized). the shift from rural to urban life is crucial for galvanizing economic development because cities bring people with goods and ideas together with those who have capital. this interaction is the foundation of a market economy. but the pathway to the market requires an additional step beyond mere networking. trading also requires something that is incredibly risky: engaging in exchanges with people who are not family members or personal friends. in markets, people agree to trade with those they do not know, and that requires a major act of faith. in africa, one great virtue of urbanization is that it has forced members of different tribes to interact on a regular basis in ways that remain unusual in more rural settings. these continuous interactions, whether in small shops, on buses, in dwellings, or in the workplace, are absolutely crucial to the development of market economies and democratic institutions, because they help break down patrimonial exchange relationships, in which local chiefs basically run a command economy. as economies become more complex due to urbanization, new skills, such as finance, become valuable; possession of these skills becomes more important than ethnicity when it comes to survival. these urban areas are also great centers of economic activity, and their citizens naturally seek to stay informed about what is going on around them. cell phones and the internet have made the outside world increasingly accessible to africans, with far-reaching consequences for economic and political life. since 2000, growth in cell-phone usage has been greater in africa than in any other region of the world: it has increased tenfold, to about 80 million subscribers. internet growth has been even more impressive: the number of people with internet access has quadrupled since 2000. still, only a small fraction of the african population today has access to cell phones or the internet. but this ""digital divide"" is closing fast, and the economic effects in terms of greater opportunity are already being felt by every would-be or already established entrepreneur. the world bank has shown, for example, how cell phones have helped farmers gain quicker access to market prices, enabling them to sell their crops for a greater profit. enhanced communication between africa and the world at large has had implications for governments as well. for much of the postcolonial era, dictatorial african governments implemented extremely severe protectionist trade and investment policies, a practice that was aided and abetted by protectionism in the industrialized world. the african business class was deprived of cutting-edge technology at home and denied access to foreign capital and markets overseas. as a result, the continent was shaken by numerous economic crises during the 1980s. in recent years, however, africa has been able to reap many of globalization's commercial benefits without paying all the financial costs, because its banking sector has been relatively sheltered from international financial markets. of course, as the continent becomes more enmeshed in the world economy, it will be less able to isolate itself from future financial shocks. throughout the 1990s, as africa urbanized and adopted modern communications technology, the costs associated with those old policies became increasingly apparent. african entrepreneurs -- and there were a few scattered about -- came to understand that they simply could not build businesses in the small and primitive markets in their own countries; as adam smith taught, sustained growth requires the expansion of the market. during the 1990s, ""openness"" became a watchword for this small entrepreneurial class: it meant the liberalization and privatization of domestic activities once firmly controlled by governments, along with globalization of the marketplace. openness also meant political change, however; in particular, it forced governments to take a fresh look at democratization. very few people today would opt to live in zimbabwe over ghana. indeed, most africans who still live in authoritarian countries probably hope for a democratic future, even if its realization may be decades away. because african societies are generally divided along tribal lines and the dominant tribe tends to monopolize resource wealth, pluralism in african politics -- along with a system of effective checks and balances -- is essential to sustained growth. in contrast to the countries of east asia, which have done reasonably well under authoritarian regimes, africa has generally done poorly, and its unelected rulers now have little credibility left with the majority of the people of their countries. this is because africa's autocrats are for the most part tribal leaders concerned only with bettering the lives of their kin. the recent election in ghana, marking one of the very few times in african history in which a peaceful transition of power has taken place, may someday be regarded as the decisive turning point when democracy finally took unshakable root in that country. to be sure, africa has seen many false dawns when it comes to political reform, but the pressures -- both domestic and international -- in support of greater democracy are rising. domestically, political parties are growing stronger, and internationally, numerous foreign aid programs have included funds for democracy building. additional sources of change from outside the continent have come as a result of greater openness to the world economy. therefore, africans are looking at the western world's response to the ***financial crisis** with a high degree of anxiety. globalizing africa foreign interest in africa has been growing. thanks to the world's portfolio investors, the capitalization of african stock markets jumped to 60 percent of gdp in 2007, up from just 20 percent two years earlier. foreign direct investment has also risen and now accounts for nearly five percent of sub-saharan africa's gdp. there are several reasons why foreigners have invested in africa. first, african banks are among the healthier financial companies anywhere in the world, having been relatively shielded from the toxic assets that are now laying waste to u.s. and european financial institutions. (capital-to-asset ratios, for example, are currently far higher for african than for american banks.) as african savings rates increase and as investment opportunities there expand, these banks will play a much larger role in local economies than they have in the past. second, robust economic growth and a rise in domestic investment -- which means the existence of more major banks and corporations -- have presented foreign investors with more serious opportunities there than ever before. third, the rise of a true african business class, comprised of executives who are often western-trained, has given foreign investors more confidence in local management. fourth, many african countries have made tremendous progress with respect to macroeconomic stabilization; in fact, thanks to independent central banks increasingly led by technocrats, the continent has compiled an enviable record on controlling inflation (with zimbabwe being an awful outlier), one that puts latin america to shame. finally, investors have been encouraged by democratization across the continent and the increasing emphasis on good governance. foreign investors were not always welcome in africa. following independence from the colonial powers, african countries, with their newly established governments, often undertook autarkic industrial policies, for both ideological and economic reasons. nationalists blamed foreign investors for many of the region's ills, and government bureaucrats did not like to see dividends flowing out of their cash-poor nations. for their part, because africa was widely viewed as a politically unstable and generally unhealthy place to do business, foreigners adopted an exploitative view of the continent. expatriate managers of foreign mining and oil companies -- the largest private investors by far -- sought to extract as many resources from the ground as they could in the shortest period of time possible. as a consequence, they never bothered to invest in africa's long-term development and instead left gaping craters in the countryside or waste dumps as lingering reminders of their operations. international criticism of such neocolonial behavior has helped change the attitudes of western investors, but african consumer spending and public opinion are probably playing an even more important role. as africa enjoys solid growth and an indigenous middle class begins to emerge in a growing number of african countries, african consumers are beginning to demand that foreign investment be made to serve broad development objectives, rather than simply pillage their wealth. noting these demands, many western companies have started to take a radically different approach to this marketplace, hiring and promoting local managers rather than expatriates. indeed, a frequently heard criticism about china's investment in africa -- which has for the most part been welcomed with open arms by african governments -- is that it contributes little to training and employing locals. fortunately, some global corporations are striving to promote local development. for example, sabmiller, one of the world's major breweries -- created by the merger of south african breweries and the miller brewing company -- has discovered how to tap the local taste for homemade brews, making them with cheap inputs, such as sorghum (instead of barley), while adapting modern technology and promoting local economic development. by buying homegrown crops instead of importing expensive barley, the company has helped stabilize local commodity prices and increase the incomes of subsistence farmers. and so the result of brewing sorghum beer for domestic consumption is more investment, more growth, and less poverty. indeed, a recent study commissioned by the company -- and carried out by this author -- found that for every single job in sabmiller's breweries in uganda (where it first produced the sorghum beer), the company supported -- directly or indirectly -- over a hundred other jobs throughout the country, contributing not just to its own bottom line but to uganda's development as well. despite some progress, very few foreign investors have paid similar attention to their long-term impact on development in africa. replicating the success of sabmiller is not impossible, but it would require multinational firms to think about their presence in a self-conscious way and then, for example, make more intensive use of local goods and services and promote exports, training, and job growth. it is the private sector, both domestic and foreign, that is driving, and will continue to drive, the region's economy. accordingly, most africans would prefer higher levels of trade, investment, and job creation to increased aid. (still, as the zambian economist dambisa moyo illustrates in her book, dead aid, african governments are having a hard time freeing themselves of easy aid ""handouts."") the global economy has provided much of the money and technology that has fueled africa's capitalist revolution. those flows remain absolutely vital to the region's continued progress. protection from protectionism the future of africa's development hinges on whether the continent will be able to complete its capitalist revolution or the tidal wave of problems created by the global ***economic crisis** will drown the hopes of the region's entrepreneurs. a recent study by the center for global development found that africa's private sector was all too often impeded by poor infrastructure, small markets, and weak governance. the study also found that ethnic fragmentation remains a divisive factor in economic and political life throughout africa. however, as mentioned above, africa is experiencing a major trend toward urbanization, which could help overcome this impediment to growth. but until its ethnic divisions are surmounted, africa is unlikely to see the rise in productivity that is the sine qua non of income growth. despite some recent success stories, democracy also continues to struggle on the african continent. young democracies in africa have had a higher failure rate than those in any other developing region, with nearly 30 percent of all cases of democratization between 1960 and 2004 ending in collapse. on a more hopeful note, however, africa's successful democracies have become increasingly stable, thanks in part to the foreign aid that has been targeted at strengthening nascent democratic institutions. this aid has built up the capacity of judiciaries and parliaments and bolstered political parties, universities, and a free press. even with strengthened democratic institutions, african countries may not be able to withstand the economic pressure from abroad given africa's growing dependence on foreign capital and trade. everywhere, countries are beginning to batten down the economic hatches, closing off their economies to foreign trade through a variety of insidious policy measures. protectionist policies that currently prevent african farmers from exporting genetically modified crops to the european union are likely to harden in the months ahead as eu leaders attempt to appease their domestic agricultural sector. trade is critical to africa's economic growth, because africans' incomes cannot rise if their countries are unable to export goods and services to richer regions. to be sure, african countries themselves must do more to create free-trade zones and promote commerce with other developing nations. but in the end, it is the wealthy consumers of europe and north america whose buying power will lift africans out of poverty. for europe and the united states, protectionism and reduced trade are merely costly, at least for now; but for africa, with its small domestic markets, they are potentially deadly. it is hard to imagine barack obama -- a u.s. president of kenyan descent -- leveling such a cruel blow against his ancestral homeland. yet although the obama administration was tireless in warning of a domestic catastrophe if congress did not pass an economic stimulus package and a bailout for u.s. banks, it has been relatively silent when it comes to warning of the international catastrophe that would accompany a renewed round of protectionist policies. the ""buy american"" provision of the stimulus package that president obama signed into law -- which he has defended as being consistent with the rules of the world trade organization -- exposes the absurdity of developed-world governments that give with one hand by promoting economic development and take with the other by practicing protectionism. africans have already taken up the shovel to dig themselves out of a half-century-old hole of poor economic management and bad governance. it is now up to the united states and its european allies to help them complete the job.",7/1/09,1,1,1,,,1

7V7G-3H31-2PBB-23HK-00000-00.txt,"no matter what the economic climate, art fairs are always a gamble for the exhibiting dealers. the cost of renting a booth, shipping precious artworks, insuring them and keeping a sales staff housed and fed in a foreign city can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars.   so in these rough times it was with a good deal of jitters that the european fine art fair -- one of the world's foremost art and antiques events -- opened here with a preview on thursday of a record 239 exhibitors from 15 countries.  it seemed like business as usual at this annual gathering, which runs through sunday.  for the party on thursday a smartly dressed, multilingual crowd waited patiently to get through the doors of the cavernous maastricht exhibition and congress center. on view was about $1 billion worth of art and objects from ancient times to the 21st century, with prices ranging from a few hundred dollars for a 19th-century british photograph to about $30 million for a van gogh landscape.  dealers hope the fair can capitalize on christie's successful $483.8 million auction of art and decorative objects belonging to yves saint laurent and his partner, pierre berge, in paris last month.  ''the saint laurent sale certainly gave the market confidence,'' said richard l. feigen, a new york dealer. ''still, there are pockets of liquidity, people who have money and are worried about the dollar, the euro, the sterling, and don't know where to park their cash. so they buy art.''   the saint laurent sale's effect on the fair could also be seen in the objects for sale. after such a landmark auction, works quickly surface, and it was no surprise to find a pair of german gold tazze (saucerlike objects on pedestals), at galerie neuse from bremen, germany. they were originally used to serve sweets, achim neuse, the gallery's owner, said. he sold them to mr. saint laurent and mr. berge years ago and bought them back last month. he is asking about $879,000 for the pair.   while it is always difficult to gauge just how much business is done at any fair -- dealers, after all, are masters of positive spin -- there were a lot of relieved faces on friday morning. at the opening christophe van de weghe, a belgian-born manhattan dealer who was exhibiting here for the first time, had sold a 1982 basquiat painting, ''untitled (black athlete),'' that was the centerpiece of his booth. depicting a full-length boxer with raised arms, it was snapped up by laurence graff, a london jeweler who also had a booth here, for $4.5 million.   a well-known basquiat fanatic, mr. graff has bought other boxer images by him. in 2007 at christie's in new york, for instance, mr. graff bought ''sugar ray robinson,'' another 1982 basquiat, for $7.3 million.   it wasn't just the painting but also the cost that clinched the deal. ''my prices are attractive,'' said mr. van de weghe, who had also sold two picasso drawings by friday morning. ''these paintings would have been a lot more expensive six months ago. it's important to make people feel they are getting a deal.''   sales did not come easily. ''everything we've sold was subject to more negotiations than last year,'' said angela westwater, whose sperone westwater gallery is in the meatpacking district of manhattan. by friday she had parted with works by the sculptor evan penny and the dutch painter jan worst.   the ***economic crisis** was felt here in less obvious ways too. several dealers admitted that they were selling artworks for clients who were seriously in need of quick cash. ''one person who got madoff-ed gave us an important old-master painting to sell,'' mr. feigen said, although he declined to identify the seller or the painting.   karsten greve, a dealer with spaces in switzerland, germany and france, was showing an exceptional suite of seven 1960s watercolors by lucio fontana priced at nearly $620,000 for the set. ''i had sold them to an american collector who had lost money, so i bought them back,'' mr. greve said. ''i had always thought they would end up at the museum of modern art.''   noticeably absent were several big-name dealers who had pulled out. among them were american galleries like acquavella, richard gray and barbara mathes, as well as leslie waddington from london. replacing them were names who had been on a waiting list for years.   ''we wanted a larger european clientele,'' said mark brady, a new york dealer who was new to the fair. among the stars in his booth was theodore rousseau's ''farm in les landes,'' a luminous landscape from a set of three of the same size and format. ''one is in the frick, the other in the museum der bildenden kunste in leipzig,'' mr. brady said. ''this is the only one left in private hands.'' the three, which rousseau began during the 1840s and '50s, were documented in a letter. this painting was in a private portuguese collection for more than 60 years, and mr. brady was asking $1.25 million for it.   people watching is always part of the fun of this fair. talk was of top collectors who were spotted perusing the booths, including sheik saud bin mohammed al-thani of qatar, the french financier michel  david-weill and the new york real-estate developer mark fisch. while there were fewer american collectors than in years past, curators from museums like the metropolitan in new york, j. paul getty in los angeles, the national gallery of art in washington, the wadsworth atheneum in hartford and the museum of fine arts, boston, could be seen walking the aisles.   this being the heart of old-master country, there was the usual array of 17th-century paintings, although not the blockbusters of years past. among the most stunning canvases was ''an old woman at a meal,'' by the dutch baroque painter gabriel metsu. it was being offered by noortman master paintings (a subsidiary of sotheby's, which acquired the gallery in 2006). the interior, which depicts a woman in a simple white bonnet eating soup, was priced at $4.6 million.   ''it came from a dutch collection,'' said anthony crichton-stuart, a former head  of christie's old-master painting department who recently joined noortman. ''paintings by metsu don't come on the market often.''   within the first 24 hours of the fair the painting had a red ''sold'' sticker beside it. while nobody at the gallery would confirm the buyer, talk among old-master dealers was that it was ike van otterloo, a collector and boston financier.   every year the fair tries to become more up-to-date to compete with art basel, the contemporary art fair held in switzerland in june. this year there was a new section devoted to 20th-century design. there was also a lot more photography than before. hans p. kraus jr., a new york photography dealer, was an addition. his booth featured seminal works like william henry fox talbot's ''ladder'' (1844), one of his best known images, for $750,000, and edward steichen's photograph of the back of a nude woman, ''the little round mirror,'' from 1902 for $1.8 million.   ''we've been waiting to get into this fair for five years,'' mr. kraus said. ''so we brought a cross section of things starting with talbot and going through to the beginning of modern photography with stieglitz and steichen.'' ",3/16/09,0,0,1,,,0
7X8C-67R1-2PMR-K31X-00000-00.txt,"washington, d.c. - two years of steep job cuts all but ended last month, unexpectedly pulling down the unemployment rate and raising hopes for a lasting economic recovery. federal figures released friday showed that the rate fell from 10.2 percent in october to 10 percent as employers shed the fewest number of jobs since the ***recession** began two years ago. the government also said far fewer jobs were lost in september and october than first reported. and the so-called underemployment rate, counting part-time workers who want full-time jobs and laid-off workers who have given up their job hunt, also fell, from 17.5 percent in october to 17.2 percent. the better-than-expected figures provided a rare dose of good news for the economy, but the respite may be temporary. job creation is still so weak that more than 15 million out-of-work americans face fierce competition for few openings. ""we will need very substantial job growth to get unemployment lower, especially when the labor force ... starts growing again,’’ said lawrence mishel, president of the economic policy institute, a liberal think tank. even counting last month’s decline, the unemployment rate has more than doubled from 4.9 percent when the ***recession** began. the report showed how hard it remains to find work. the number of people jobless for at least six months rose last month to 5.9 million. and the average length of unemployment has risen to more than 28 weeks, the longest on record dating to 1948. carolyn malone of milwaukee had not looked for work in decades - until she was laid off from her customer-service job in may. malone, 62, laughed when asked friday how many jobs she had applied for. she can’t remember. but she does recall how many landed her an interview: one. it didn’t lead to a job. ""i just want to get my toe in the door,’’ she said, scrolling through her e-mail at a hiring center. still, economists and investors drew hope from friday’s labor department report. employers sliced just 11,000 jobs in november, compared with a loss of 111,000 jobs in october. it was the best reading since december 2007 - the last time the economy added jobs and the start of the worst ***recession** since the 1930s. the unemployment rate had not fallen since july, when it declined from 9.5 percent to 9.4 percent. factories, retailers, construction companies - hardest hit by the ***recession** - all slowed the pace of layoffs in november. so did transportation companies and those in leisure and hospitality. job gains were produced in education, health care and professional and business services, which mostly reflected temporary hiring. the government added workers, too. those included states and localities, mainly reflecting the hiring of teachers. president barack obama welcomed the news but lamented that too many americans ""have felt the gut punch of a pink slip.’’ facing the prospect of high unemployment well into the 2012 presidential election year, obama is drafting a proposal to try to stimulate hiring. ""we need to grow jobs and get america back to work as quickly as we can,’’ he said. just a month ago, an unexpected spike in the unemployment rate caused some economists to predict it could climb as high as 11 percent. but friday’s report lessened that pessimism, and economists doubted the rate would reach that point. still, the jobless rate is expected to resume moving higher, perhaps to 10.5 percent or more by the middle of next year, before drifting down. that’s because the recovery is likely to be too weak to spur the job creation needed to quickly drive down the unemployment rate. the federal reserve has estimated that the rate could remain as high as 7.6 percent in 2012. ""the economic storm destroyed more than 7 million jobs over the last two years, and it will take more than two years to get them back,’’ said bill cheney, chief economist at john hancock. ""the economy is still weak.’’ competition for jobs is so intense that marla goldman of spring hill, tenn., has heard back from only six prospective employers out of 100 she’s applied to since losing her job with an electronics systems company in october. she made it to a fifth interview with a company, which booked her a plane ticket to florida and even sent her an itinerary. but two days later, the company decided to wait on the job until after jan. 1. ""there are just far more candidates for every job than there are jobs,’’ said goldman, 50. to rev up hiring, obama plans to send congress a list of ideas, including new tax breaks for small businesses that hire, some new spending on roads, bridges and other construction and grants to state and local governments to avoid layoffs, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the package was still being crafted. congress is not likely to take up a job-creation package until after new year’s. the administration credits its $787 billion package of tax cuts and increased government spending with improving employment, though republicans argue it did not help much. the fed’s record-low interest rates, along with other moves to drive down loan rates and stimulate borrowing, have supported the economic rebound. most economists said they did not think the better-than-expected jobs news would cause the fed to raise rates sooner. that’s because they predict the jobless rate will remain high and job creation too sluggish. most analysts do not expect the economy to add jobs consistently each month until spring. until employers gain confidence in the recovery, they will be reluctant to ramp up hiring. the few industries creating jobs will probably include health care, education, legal services, data processing, transportation, high-tech manufacturing, electrical power generation and jobs involved in making homes and buildings more energy-efficient, according to labor secretary hilda solis and private economists. but november’s report suggested that the worst of the job losses are past. and figures out friday showed that job losses in september and october were not nearly as deep as previously estimated. the government said 159,000 few jobs were cut in those two months combined. such revisions are based on more complete information the government gets from companies it surveys. from january through march, the economy lost at least 600,000 jobs each month. employment has improved more in some other countries. canada, for instance, said friday that its economy added 79,000 jobs last month, reducing its jobless rate to 8.5 percent from 8.6 percent. canada did not suffer the type of housing meltdown and ***financial crisis** that slammed the u.s. economy last year. --- associated press writers philip elliott in allentown, pa., emily fredrix in milwaukee and andrew taylor in washington contributed to this report.

7V8B-68F0-Y9J0-Y1YJ-00000-00.txt,"c(""mar. 14--the ***recession** has driven north county's golf industry into the rough, but not quite into the trees, according to companies' financial reports and people who follow the industry.club maker callaway golf co., the area's largest sporting-goods manufacturer, reported a slight drop in revenue for 2008 after years of hefty gains. a poway company that makes shafts for clubs said thursday that it lost money as revenue fell 22 percent last year.on the links, some local golf courses have reported fewer people teeing off on recent mornings, and some have cut their employees' hours.on the other hand, sunny weather for most of this year has given a boost to the companies that own and manage golf courses.and an annual equipment expo this weekend is expecting one of its busiest years yet, an organizer said. shelley hall, who co-launched san diego golf fest in 1998, said the ***recession** may boost attendance as golfers pile in to take advantage of discounts on clubs and on greens fees.\""the retail stores are just getting killed,\"" hall said. \""people are looking for a great value right now. people are just not buying the stuff they don't need.\""the latest evidence of golfers' scaled-back \""needs\"" came thursday from aldila inc. of poway. the manufacturer, whose graphite and hybrid steel shafts are considered above average in terms of quality and price, said a 22 percent decline in annual revenue, to $54 million, led the company to a $2.5 million loss for the year.\""we expect the first half of 2009 to be particularly challenging until some level of consumer confidence is restored and our customers revert back to normal ordering patterns,\"" aldila chief executive peter mathewson told investors and analysts on a conference call.consumers' confidence is particularly important for north county when it comes to golf, because the area is home to perhaps the heaviest concentration of golf equipment makers in the united states, if not the world.about 2,700 people worked in san diego county's sporting-goods industry as of last summer, according to the most recent data from the state government. local sporting-goods manufacturers employed nearly twice as many people as any other metro area in the united states, according to commerce department data from 2006, the latest year for which the agency has compiled nationwide figures.the worldwide ***recession** has accelerated the industry's trend toward fewer employees, however. it chipped about $7 million from callaway's revenue in 2008, and the manufacturer managed to keep profits growing by cutting 164 of the 1,800 jobs at its headquarters and factory in carlsbad.in publishing those figures in late january, callaway said that jittery consumers, the nation's shaky financial system and fluctuating exchange rates have made it impossible to predict what its 2009 sales and profit could be.a spokesman said friday that new standards for the striking face of wedge clubs could give club manufacturers a boost. and callaway's new series of interchangeable clubs and shafts could help its own sales, the spokesman said.analyst casey alexander said last week that he expects annual sales for callaway, which also makes golf balls and apparel, to fall 8 percent to $1.03 billion and its profits to fall 56 percent to $29 million. the company's shares have fallen by about 55 percent since mid-september, when the u.s. financial system began to unravel, compared with a 40 percent decline in the standard &amp; poor's 500 index.callaway's shares closed at $6.35 on friday, giving the company an implicit market value of about $409 million. alexander said that value isn't much greater than the $401 million value callaway reported for its factories, cash, accounts receivable and other tangible assets as of dec. 31. a market value well in excess of a company's book value indicates investors' confidence that a company will generate substantial profit in the future.\""investors are so down on consumer-oriented stocks that they've sold them down to the value of their hard assets,\"" alexander said.taylormade, the carlsbad-based golf apparel division of the sporting-goods giant adidas, plans to cut 170 jobs this year as it consolidates its ashworth division, which it recently acquired. the company has said that the cuts aren't related to the shaky economy.a top manager at north county's largest golf-course operator said the ***recession**'s effects on golf courses have been mild. golf courses reported flagging attendance late last year, but the manager said unseasonably sunny weather has offset the economic gloom.\""all in all, it's turning out to be a good year,\"" said john mcnair, vice president for golf at jc resorts, which runs seven golf courses in north county and temecula. \""we hope the sun keeps shining.\""to see more of the north county times, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.nctimes.com. copyright (c) 2009, north county times, escondido, calif. distributed by mcclatchy-tribune information services. for reprints, email tmsreprints@permissionsgroup.com, call 800-374-7985 or 847-635-6550, send a fax to 847-635-6968, or write to the permissions group inc., 1247 milwaukee ave., suite 303, glenview, il 60025, usa."",

7WR8-8TS0-Y9KG-D11H-00000-00.txt,"atlanta has been rocked by the deep ***recession** of the past two years, like most cities. but the city has a huge financial problem caused not by the global downturn, but by its own leaders.in 2001 and 2005, the atlanta city council approved substantial increases in pension benefits for city workers --- but didn't figure out how to pay for them. those decisions are not only hobbling city finances now, they threaten to cripple the city budget for years to come.in the 2002 fiscal year, when mayor shirley franklin took office, the city paid $43 million to its employee pension plans. as of june 30, that cost had more than tripled, to $136 million, according to official city council pension reports.as a result, atlanta has had to shovel tens of millions of dollars more into worker pensions, even as the city's revenues have declined and officials have laid off hundreds of workers. and residents have paid ever larger chunks of their property taxes to city worker retirement plans.during the last fiscal year, at least 17.5 percent --- $100 million --- of the city's general fund budget went to pension costs. that's money that didn't pay for more cops on the street, fixing potholes or picking up trash. whatever the cost is this fiscal year --- it will be set by actuaries later this year --- it will be much larger than the $56 million the city expects to raise through a 3 mill property tax increase approved by a divided city council this summer.in 2001 and 2005, the city council dramatically increased pension benefits --- in some cases increasing them 50 percent --- for city workers. the city has no social security for its employees, and pay is generally less than surrounding areas. the city saw its pension program as a way to attract and keep employees, especially cops and firefighters.it hasn't worked; police and firefighters still are leaving at about the same rate. what has changed is atlanta's bottom line.howard shook, the city council's finance chairman, said those votes, which he supported at the time, were mistakes.""when you make pension decisions in haste, you unleash something that is going to be around with you for years,"" he said.shook said the council has realized it needs to address this problem, so it set up a select committee, which he co-chairs, to look at the pension crisis. the committee, in a recent report, estimated the city's pension obligation --- what it estimates it now owes for the benefits of all current and future retirees --- is at least $1.2 billion. all three pensions --- for police, fire and general employees --- were well below proper funding levels (90 percent or higher). and that was before the ***recession** hit pension fund investments, reducing the funds' value and increasing what the city will have to pay now to fill the gap.cecelia corbin hunter, who chaired a city advisory committee on pensions in 2005, said the council has ""a history of enhancing benefits without understanding the cost.""if the next administration and city council don't curb costs, the pensions will damage atlanta's fiscal health even further by draining dwindling resources and threatening the city's financial reputation with banks and borrowers.this spring, fitch, the bond rating agency, downgraded atlanta's bonds with an outlook of ""negative."" standard &amp; poor's also downgraded the city. fitch cited ""uncertainty"" over future pension costs, noting that those costs doubled as a percentage of the city budget from 2002 to 2008. later this year, fitch gave up on rating atlanta's bonds altogether. with low or no ratings, atlanta will have to pay more in interest to borrow money, since lenders will consider such loans riskier.while the city likely will have to scale back benefits for future hires, the benefits already given can't be touched. so it will have to continue to pay tens of millions more annually into existing pension plans until the current plan members die off decades from now.""almost all of the recent concerns about the city's financial condition are tied directly to increased pension costs,"" said greg giornelli, the city's chief operating officer.john sherman, president of the fulton county taxpayers association, said the city paying more than $100 million a year to retirement benefits of employees instead of city services is ""absolutely insane.""city hall numbers crunchers are looking at how to slash costs. one idea is to set up retirement programs similar to a 401(k), which requires only a flat payment by the city. city officials set up something similar for general employees in 2001, but pensions remained popular with city workers.franklin said her staffers are looking over the select committee's report and the city is hiring a firm to study ways to revamp its retirement plans. ""i expect to make recommendations to the council on the pension plans before the end of the year,"" the mayor said in an e-mail to the atlanta journal-constitution.franklin said she has supported regular reviews of pension packages during her eight years in office and has tried to limit expenses.she said she neither supported nor opposed the council's 2005 vote. the 2001 vote took place before her tenure.the city is even considering paying into social security, the federal retirement system, for the first time. when social security started in 1935, it was optional for local governments. most later signed up, but atlanta did not.city union leaders have long argued workers need good pensions because no city employees get social security.james glass, chief financial officer, is the no-nonsense accountant-engineer franklin brought in last year from the private sector. glass immediately honed in on pensions as a key problem. his conclusion: he could not undo what the city council granted. the city is obligated to provide benefits promised to current pension plan members.but, he said, the city has to change plans for future hires. future workers will get less and pay more.""everything i'm trying to do is to lay a groundwork for stabilizing the finances of the city of atlanta,"" glass said.workers, retirees worriedsuch talk from an outgoing administration in an election year has city employees and retirees worried. they see atlanta's pensions as one of the few incentives for workers who argue they have been underpaid for years.jim daws, president of atlanta professional fire fighters, the city fire union, said pensions were ""a damned good deal for the city"" if the city had properly funded them over time. he said all city workers want is a ""dignified retirement.""today atlanta city workers get up to 80 percent of their pay when they retire. it's a larger pension than some places, but city workers also pay more into the pension than many other places.one sergeant, who recently retired at age 56 with 27.5 years on the force, is now getting $61,000 annually. when he dies, his spouse will get the checks --- 75 percent of his pay --- until she dies.gina pagnotta, president of the professional association of city employees, which represents about 350 city workers, said her union planned this year to lobby city council for an increase in pension benefits. now, she said, she is hoping to stave off cuts for future workers. pagnotta expects political fireworks.""i am feeling sorry for the next mayor of the city of atlanta,"" she said.pensions evolved in the last century as a way for companies and governments to keep workers by providing retirement benefits. both employers and employees paid into the pension funds. the funds were invested in the stock market, real estate and bonds. when employees retired, they were guaranteed certain benefits. as long as the pensions had enough money to cover future payments to retirees, the system worked.pensions ran into trouble as retirees started living longer, workers pressured employers to sweeten benefits and investments sometimes did not bring needed returns. some businesses and governments did not properly fund their pensions. in time, shortfalls compounded to become billion-dollar headaches.state laws require certain levels of funding for public pensions, and financial standards organizations call for pensions to have as much as 90 percent of their liabilities --- what they owe retirees now and in the future --- already paid into the fund to be considered healthy.some governments were better funded than others, so when economic or other problems arose, payments were manageable. for example, dekalb county's pension was 117 percent funded in 2004, according to the atlanta city council's just released special report on the pension crisis. by 2008, it dropped to 82 percent, but it was still much better funded than atlanta's.the atlanta firefighters' pension funding level decreased from 77 percent funded to 64 percent for the same years, while the police pension dropped from 71 percent to 66 percent and the general employees' fund dropped from 61 percent to 55.9 percent in 2008.in recent decades, many private companies replaced pension plans with 401(k)s to control costs. under such plans, companies contribute to retirement but do not guarantee benefits at retirement, so costs are set. many governments, like atlanta, kept their pensions largely intact as a benefit for government workers, who were often paid less than they would be in the private sector. but then costs skyrocketed.with atlanta underfunding its pensions for years, the funds had insufficient money to invest and earn interest to cover growing costs.compounding that problem, in 2001 the council voted to increase pension benefits 50 percent for police officers and to award those benefits retroactively. they also increased firefighters' pensions, but not as much.hunter, the former member of the advisory committee on pensions, said the increase in 2001 was ""devastating to the system.""four years later, the council voted to raise firefighter pension benefits to the level of police. general employees, the largest group of city workers, also got a somewhat smaller increase. janice davis, who was franklin's cfo before glass, told the city council the pension benefits would increase the city's liability, but the city could afford it. davis, who left to work for the north texas tollway authority, wouldn't comment for this story. franklin told the ajc she left it to the city council to take the lead.rick anderson, franklin's former cfo, now retired in florida, said via e-mail that the city council ""caved in to pressure from employee unions in an election year [both 2001 and 2005 had city elections] ... in the final analysis, no one had the gumption to just say 'no' to what employees wanted.""layoffs and cutbacksdigging out is going to require major changes. the city has started with a move that bought it time and reduced annual payments. in july, it extended the due date by which the pensions had to be fully funded from 2017 to 2030. the change --- akin to extending the mortgage on a house --- dropped the city's annual payments. but the city still has to pay as much as $100 million annually going forward.combined with plummeting city tax revenues, atlanta officials have had no choice but to cut city operations to keep its budget balanced and its pension program funded.the result: hundreds of layoffs and millions of dollars in cutbacks. the department of parks, recreation and cultural affairs lost 57 positions --- 17 percent of the total --- from fiscal year 2009 to 2010. during the same time, the department's budget dropped from $29.6 million to $25.3 million. other departments saw similar reductions.municipalities across the country have wrestled with exploding pension costs as the economy faltered. last year, vallejo, calif., voted for bankruptcy in part because of its pension payments.carter doyle, a georgia state university professor and a public pension expert, said public pensions across the country now have combined unfunded liabilities of about $1 trillion. doyle said for years local governments pushed off the problem. new national accounting standards and the ***financial crisis** have forced governments to face their pension costs.""they kept kicking the can down the road. ... it's not sustainable over time,"" doyle said.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||how

""it's like taking somebody's post office away.""trying to rein in costsmunicipal consolidation is an age-old movement that's resurfacing during the ***recession** as states, counties and cities wrestle with declining revenue and anti-government sentiment escalates. mergers traditionally face opposition in communities eager to protect their fiefdoms and independence.to date, much of the push has been in dense urban areas subdivided into many governments that provide similar services. the result: different entities handle trash pickup or provide police protection from one side of the street to the next.in new jersey's sussex county, voters in wantage township last month rejected a proposed merger with sussex borough even though it was expected to save voters money. also in new jersey, 1-square-mile medford lakes turned down the opportunity to save money and share police with the township that surrounds it.but in western new york, four towns voted this year by referendum to reduce the number of seats on town councils from five to three. other communities downsized voluntarily.""a lot of counties are realizing that regional is the way to go,"" says jacqueline byers, director of research and outreach at the national association of counties.steady population declinesalmost two-thirds of the counties in nebraska and in other great plains states have lost people since 1950, the census bureau says. sixty-nine of the 376 counties in the region lost more than half their population and most counties have fewer than 10,000 people. in nebraska alone, 11 of the state's 93 counties have fewer than 1,000 people and 36 have fewer than 5,000.the platte institute commissioned an analysis by geography professors at the university of nebraska-kearney to determine how many government centers would be needed to provide county services within 60 miles of most nebraska residents.researchers excluded the eight counties in the more urban eastern portion of the state and focused on the remaining 85. they concluded that 20 ""consolidated county centers"" could serve residents. if they became new county seats, the number of county offices would be cut 77%. the platte institute now will explore potential cost savings from consolidation, mccollister says.""it's not real clear what efficiency savings would be in those places that barely have services to begin with,"" says rutgers university professor frank popper.he and his wife deborah popper, who teaches geography at the city university of new york's college of staten island, predicted more than 20 years ago that plains population losses would lead government to take over large expanses of the region and return them to their natural state by creating a ""buffalo commons"" -- a national park where bison would roam.in cherry county, nebraska's largest, stretching over 5,961 square miles -- three times the size of delaware -- some residents have to drive 150 miles one way to the county seat of valentine to renew their vehicle licenses every year.""i don't see this county consolidating with anybody,"" says rancher jerry adamson, a county commissioner.

(the default rate for the last 12 months has averaged about 2.7 percent.)parmelee said the increases in defaults can largely be attributed due to tighter credit offerings, limited availability of capital from banks and global economic woes.in the first nine months of 2008, six gaming companies rated by standard &amp; poor's have defaulted on their loans. from 1997 -- 2007, there were a total of nine defaults of rated gaming companies.despite the grim and unprecedented statistics, tribal gaming default rates are nonexistent compared to their corporate counterparts. of the six rated gaming companies that defaulted this year through september, none was tribally owned.parmelee said that as a result of the negative economic tide, his firm has downgraded its financial ratings of 22 gaming entities this year. (a downgrade means that the firm's opinion of that entity's credit quality has declined.) nineteen of these entities have been commercial; three have been native.as of early october, more than 40 percent of the commercial gaming operators that standard &amp; poor's rates had been downgraded, compared to about 15 percent of the native operators it rates.one of the most recently downgraded tribes is the mashantucket pequot tribal nation, which operates foxwoods resort casino in connecticut.of the 12 companies currently ranked on standard &amp; poor's list of lowest-rated gaming enterprises, two are american indian.frank king, managing director of tribal banking for merrill lynch, said during the nafoa conference call that it is to the detriment of tribal gaming to be linked with corporate gaming's risky financial background.\""difficult times in corporate gaming are going to have a significant impact on tribes' ability to borrow,\"" he predicted, noting that many financial companies see the industry as monolithic -- not distinguishing between the types of gaming investors and their different behaviors. \""investors tend to like to throw the baby out with the bathwater.\""he added: \""corporate gaming has placed some pretty big bets in the last couple of years, and they look like they're going to lose on those bets.\""in contrast, tribes have generally entered the ***economic downturn** with better balance sheets. leveraged buyouts, for instance, have no place in indian country, and tribes do not generally face the same growth pressures as public gaming companies.tribal operators also, on average, tend to be more conservative than many commercial gaming operators; and in many cases, tribes operate casinos where few other casinos are located, reducing competition during challenging periods.noting parmelee's numbers, king said tribal gaming enterprises are performing much better than their corporate counterparts in terms of not defaulting on loans and maintaining positive financial ratings.king said it is necessary for tribal operators to look at all upcoming projects they have on the table and realize that they may end up costing more than they ever believed they might.\""it may not seem fair,\"" he said. \""but it's the reality.\""reflecting on concerns about the linkage between commercial and tribal gaming, nafoa president bill lomax said that the commercial lenders and investment bankers have done a generally good job of learning about the differences between tribal casino facilities and the corporate gaming entities. he noted that from 2005 -- 07, tribes experienced the most favorable lending climate they have ever seen, although those conditions have now come to a halt due to the credit crisis.lomax added, however, that tribes do tend to face a more difficult time in borrowing than the corporate casinos, but he believes this reality is not really the fault of bankers.\""the biggest problem is that when a bank seeks an investor to participate in a bond issuance, the investors will often ask for some type of comparable entity so that they can use that comparable as a benchmark when they try to assess the risk of the investment.\""when this is done in the nontribal gaming world, comparables are readily available in las vegas and atlantic city and elsewhere because corporate entities typically have to disclose financial information to their shareholders or regulators.\""tribes, however, do not disclose financial information to the wider world and thus there is no comparable information for an investor to use to make an informed decision concerning the risk of the investment. a lack of information about risk will always lead to the investor requiring a higher return on their investment.\""lomax said tribes would be helped \""significantly\"" if an independent body were to gather financial information on a regional basis that could be used in aggregate form to provide comparable information for the region. he said this scenario would not only lower costs for tribes trying to borrow money for a new facility or an expansion, it would give tribal casino managers a benchmark to gauge the relative success of their facility.in a follow-up interview, parmelee said he couldn't speak as to how investors are treating tribal operators compared to commercial operators.still, he added that u.s. consumers are significantly pulling back their spending, and from his vantage point, the majority of casinos -- both tribal and commercial -- are experiencing meaningful earnings declines.\""in this environment, it seems to me that investors would naturally be cautious,\"" he said.to see more of indian country today, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.indiancountry.com. copyright (c) 2008, indian country today, oneida, n.y. distributed by mcclatchy-tribune information services. for reprints, email tmsreprints@permissionsgroup.com, call 800-374-7985 or 847-635-6550, send a fax to 847-635-6968, or write to the permissions group inc., 1247 milwaukee ave., suite 303, glenview, il 60025, usa."",

""i didn't expect the stadium to be packed. this is unbelievable.""this was no ordinary acquisition. fueled by its obsession to reclaim spanish supremacy from barcelona, real purchased ronaldo, the reigning world player of the year, from manchester united for $133.5 million, by far the biggest transfer fee in soccer history.that figure didn't cover his salary, mind you. it was just for the rights to the transcendent winger, who will join his new teammates at fedex field on sunday for a preseason friendly against d.c. united.ronaldo was hardly real's only addition this summer. a week before ronaldo's majestic entrance, brazilian superstar kakã¡, named the best player on the planet in 2007, was welcomed by 55,000 at bernabeu after being acquired from ac milan for $93.2 million.and a few days after the ronaldo event, about 30,000 turned out for the presentation of french forward karim benzema, a $50.2 million purchase from lyon.there was more to come: a few days before embarking on its mls tour, which began with a 5-1 victory at toronto fc on friday, real claimed spanish midfielder xabi alonso from liverpool for $56.6 million.all told, real bought eight players for $375 million. the club's overall payroll this season is an estimated $130 million. the new york yankees will spend almost $210 million on salaries this season, but in acquiring talent, they didn't have to worry about massive transfer fees.one of the few instances of a major league baseball team spending exorbitantly for the rights to a player outside its league was the boston red sox paying $51.1 million for the rights to acquire pitcher daisuke matsuzaka from the japanese circuit in 2007.although real's moves have stoked the fire in a blistering rivalry with barcelona and attracted even greater worldwide attention to soccer's finest pro league, the huge expenditures amid a global ***economic crisis** have not been universally well received.""i would say in this financial climate, it is surprising -- a little bit destabilizing of the market,"" david taylor, general secretary of uefa, the governing body for european soccer, told the bbc.

(these and all other figures in this column, unless otherwise noted, come from the department of community health.)the senate finance committee's version would be little better: just over $2 billion cumulatively, and more than $400 million a year by 2019.these figures represent only the state's share of adding as many as 756,000 georgians to medicaid, which already serves 1 million state residents. federal taxes would cover the vast majority of the new expenses.trillion may be the new billion in washington, but down here even a measly million still means something. georgia's health-related budget for this fiscal year is already $3.5 billion, or one in five dollars the state government spends. so we're talking about increasing health spending by at least 10 percent --- or else cutting hundreds of millions of dollars from other health programs.in absolute terms, we're talking about adding about as much in health spending over five years as the state cut from last year's total budget due to the ***recession**. another $900 million has been sliced from this year's budget. the cuts would have been worse if not for federal stimulus money, which will run out long before a new medicaid mandate hits.all of this includes only those changes related to expanding medicaid. new health laws could cost the state in ways that are less measurable for now, from increased insurance premiums for its own employees to the expense of running a new federally mandated insurance exchange.keep in mind, too, this phrase from dch's overview of the impact of expanding medicaid: both health proposals now before congress ""offer states a higher federal match at least initially to help pay for the medical costs of the newly eligible"" people (emphasis added).translation: as washington's costs explode, congress may try to shift more of the financial burden onto the states. as things stand, the congressional budget office estimates that the house bill would cost state governments $34 billion in new medicaid and state children's health insurance program (schip) spending.all in all, this presents a significant, perhaps impossible, challenge for georgia.and it gets worse. congress is also contemplating some people-shuffling, which would cost georgia even more money. the house bill would move kids in poor families out of schip and into medicaid. because the feds reimburse states for those programs at different rates, georgia could lose up to $48 million a year in federal matching funds if that switch takes place.i've said it before, and i'll say it now: we need to change our health care system. the status quo works for many people. but even we, the relatively comfortable, have only tenuous security.the ""solutions"" that congress is now debating, however, fail on every level of logic, and for every level of government --- and, by extension, taxpayer.we can't afford these plans. scrap 'em. start over.kyle wingfield, an opinion columnist, appears on thursdays. reach him at kwingfield@ajc.com",11/22/09,0,0,1,,,0

(in fiscal year 2007, the fund had $28 billion, and in 2008, it had $24.3 billion.)with revenue down and a constitutional requirement for a balanced budget, crist had to either cut spending or raise taxes.""this is not a concerted effort on the part of our governor and legislature to cut the budget,"" said dominic m. calabro, president and ceo of florida taxwatch. ""it is because of the worst economy florida has had since the great depression.""crist has defended the budget-cut claim by saying that in other states, taxes were increased to cover shortfalls. while crist didn't push for tax increases to make up the entire shortfall, he did approve fee and tax increases this year - on everything from fishing licenses to initial vehicle registrations to cigarettes - that total $2.2 billion.so while it is true that state government has shrunk by 10 percent since crist's election, it had little to do with him, and a lot to do with the shrinking economy. for those reasons, we give crist's statement a barely true.* * *about this statement:published: monday, october 26th, 2009 at 1:10 p.m.subjects: job accomplishmentssources: florida constitution; fiscal analysis in brief for fiscal year 2009-10; august 2009 revenue estimating conference workpapers; august 2008 revenue estimating conference workpapers; august 2009 general revenue financial outlook statement; august 2008 general revenue financial outlook statement; august 2007 general revenue financial outlook statement; general revenue financial retrospect statement for fy 2006-07 and fy 2007-08researched by: janet zinkedited by: greg joyce",10/26/09,0,0,1,,,0

7WX7-4DB0-Y9NV-2015-00000-00.txt,"senate president elizabeth mitchell is behind a renewed push for requiring maine businesses to provide paid sick time to employees, in part because of concerns over the spread of the h1n1 flu virus.mitchell, d-vassalboro, is working with the maine women's lobby, maine coalition to end domestic violence and others to promote ''an act to aid in the prevention of the spread of h1n1 influenza by ensuring the provision of earned paid sick time.''during a conference call with reporters tuesday, mitchell said she considers h1n1 ''a public health emergency'' that demands that workers stay home when they are sick. but for the estimated 47 percent of full-time private-sector workers in maine who don't get paid sick time, it's hard to stay home, she said.''that is a particularly cruel piece of advice if you don't have a paid sick day,'' she said.the legislation is a revised version of a bill that failed to pass the maine house in 2008.business groups - the maine state chamber of commerce and nfib/maine - are critical of the new bill, saying businesses can't afford to extend new benefits during the ***recession**.''no matter how well-intentioned, in this economic climate i just think it's incredible to expect small businesses to pick up this added cost when so many of them are struggling to survive,'' said peter gore, a lobbyist with the maine state chamber of commerce.the legislation, expected to go to the labor committee when the legislature reconvenes in january, would require businesses with fewer than 25 employees to let workers accrue one hour of sick time for every 80 hours worked.that equals slightly greater than three paid sick days per year for full-time workers, and would apply to part-time workers as well.full-time workers at larger businesses could earn about six paid sick days a year.the days could be used for illness, preventive care, to tend to a family member if there's a public health emergency, and for instances of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking.maine would be the first state in the country to mandate paid sick time, but three cities - milwaukee, san francisco and the district of columbia - have similar provisions, said sarah standiford, executive director of the maine women's lobby.dr. daniel summers, a winthrop doctor who specializes in adolescent medicine and pediatrics, said patients recover faster if they stay home when sick.''as a pediatrician, i see parents and children every day who are ill and had to delay coming to see me because they can't get time off,'' he said.mitchell said paid sick time is essential to reducing the spread of h1n1, particularly since food-service, child-care and nursing-home workers often don't get to take paid time off if they are sick.''it's a responsible approach,'' she said.

(it is well to remember how often power still passes through violence in many parts of the world.) this is a transition of order, accomplished in peace.the people have spoken, through their votes. change is accomplished, through an unchanged political process.in a different context, mr. obama noted in his inaugural speech that we are still a young country. our democratic experiment is still unfolding.but there are certain truths that must stand immovable at the center of our system or else we sacrifice the freedoms that define our democracy.free enterprise, freedom of speech and of religion, the protection of law are as fundamental to the american democracy as is our freedom to choose our next leader.but as enamored as we are of change, we must not blindly embrace it. we must ask: change from what into what? as the country seeks deliverance from a severe ***economic crisis**, we may be unwisely tempted to change too many of our fundamental freedoms in a reaction of fear.we must also take care not to put too much faith in change alone. the inauguration of a new president will not by itself right the economy and reverse the ***recession**.mr. obama understands this -- our challenges \""will not be met easily or in a short span of time,\"" he said on tuesday.but he struck the right note of hope when he added, \""but they will be met.\""he called for a reaffirmation of the noble foundations of our democracy. he called for hard work and persistence in meeting our problems. he called for unity of purpose among americans, and an end to petty conflicts and recriminations among politicians.and in the end he chose to quote george washington's exhortation to a young nation: that \""when nothing but hope and virtue could survive ... the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it].\""our nation has desperately sought hope in recent months. let us now devote ourselves to virtue, the personal and national qualities of character necessary to preserve our freedoms.to see more of the daily progress or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.dailyprogress.com. copyright (c) 2009, the daily progress, charlottesville, va. distributed by mcclatchy-tribune information services. for reprints, email tmsreprints@permissionsgroup.com, call 800-374-7985 or 847-635-6550, send a fax to 847-635-6968, or write to the permissions group inc., 1247 milwaukee ave., suite 303, glenview, il 60025, usa."",

4TJ5-8GW0-TX4F-D02B-00000-00.txt,"posted: 7:15 am- new york - as the debate over a $700 billion bank bailout rages on in washington, one of the nation's largest banks - washington mutual inc.- has collapsed under the weight of its enormous bad bets on the mortgage market.the federal deposit insurance corp. seized wamu on thursday, and then sold the thrift's banking assets to jpmorgan chase&amp; co. for $1.9 billion.seattle-based wamu, which was founded in 1889, is the largest bank to fail by far in the country's history. its $307 billion in assets eclipse the $40 billion of continental illinois national bank, which failed in 1984, and the $32 billion of indymac, which the government seized in july.one positive is that the sale of wamu's assets to jpmorgan chaseprevents the thrift's collapse from depleting the fdic's insurance fund. but that detail is likely to give only marginal solace to americans facing tighter lending and watching their stock portfolios plunge in the wake of the nation's most momentous ***financial crisis** since the great depression.because of wamu's souring mortgages and other risky debt, jpmorganplans to write down wamu's loan portfolio by about $31 billion - a figure that could change if the government goes through with its bailout plan and jpmorgandecides to take advantage of it.""we're in favor of what the government is doing, but we're not relying on what the government is doing. we would've done it anyway,"" jpmorgan's chief executive jamie dimon said in a conference call thursday night, referring to the acquisition. dimon said he does not know if jpmorganwill take advantage of the bailout.wamu is jpmorgan chase's second acquisition this year of a major financial institution hobbled by losing bets on mortgages. in march, jpmorganbought the investment bank bear stearns cos. for about $1.4 billion, plus another $900 million in stock ahead of the deal to secure it.jpmorgan chaseis now the second-largest bank in the united states after bank of america corp., which recently bought merrill lynch in a flurry of events that included lehman brothers holdings inc.going bankrupt and american international group inc., the world's largest insurer, getting taken over by the government.jpmorganalso said thursday it plans to sell $8 billion in common stock to raise capital.the downfall of wamu has been widely anticipated for some time because of the company's heavy mortgage-related losses. as investors grew nervous about the bank's health, its stock price plummeted 95 percent from a 52-week high of $36.47 to its close of $1.69 thursday. on wednesday, it suffered a ratings downgrade by standard &amp; poor's that put it in danger of collapse.wamu ""was under severe liquidity pressure,"" fdic chairman sheila bair told reporters in a conference call.""for all depositors and other customers of washington mutual bank, this is simply a combination of two banks,"" bair said in a statement. ""for bank customers, it will be a seamless transition. there will be no interruption in services and bank customers should expect business as usual come friday morning.""besides jpmorgan chase, wells fargo &amp; co., citigroup inc., hsbc, spain's banco santander and toronto-dominion bank of canada were also reportedly possible suitors. wamu was believed to be talking to private equity firms as well.the seizure by the government means shareholders' equity in wamu was wiped out. the deal leaves private equity investors including the firm tpg capital, which led a $7 billion cash infusion in the bank this spring, on the sidelines empty handed.wamu ran into trouble after it got caught up in the once-booming subprime mortgage business. troubles then spread to other parts of wamu's home loan portfolio, namely its ""option"" adjustable-rate mortgage loans. option arm loans offer very low introductory payments and let borrowers defer some interest payments until later years. the bank stopped originating those loans in june.problems in wamu's home loan business began to surface in 2006, when the bank reported that the division lost $48 million, compared with net income of about $1 billion in 2005.at the start of 2007, following the release of the company's annual financial report, then-ceo kerry killinger said the bank had prepared for a slowdown in its housing business by sharply reducing its subprime mortgage lending and servicing of loans. alan h. fishman, the former president and chief operating officer of sovereign bank and president and ceo of independence community bank, replaced killinger earlier this month.as more borrowers became delinquent on their mortgages, wamu worked to help troubled customers refinance their loans as a way to avoid default and foreclosure, committing $2 billion to the effort last april. but that proved to be too little, too late.at the same time, fears of growing credit problems kept investors from purchasing debt backed by those loans, drying up a source of cash flow for banks that made subprime loans.in december, wamu said it would shutter its subprime lending business and reduce expenses with layoffs and a dividend cut.the bank in july reported a $3 billion second-quarter loss - the biggest in its history - as it boosted its reserves to more than $8 billion to cover losses on bad loans. over the last three quarters, it added $10.9 billion to its loan-loss provisions.jpmorgan chasesaid it was not acquiring any senior unsecured debt, subordinated debt, and preferred stock of wamu's banks, or any assets or liabilities of the holding company, washington mutual inc.jpmorganalso said it will not take on the lawsuits facing the holding company.jpmorgan chasesaid the acquisition will give it 5,400 branches in 23 states, and that it plans to close less than 10 percent of the two companies' branches.the wamu acquisition would add 50 cents per share to jpmorgan's earnings in 2009, the bank said, adding that it expects to have pretax merger costs of approximately $1.5 billion while achieving pretax savings of approximately $1.5 billion by 2010.""this is a definite win for jpmorgan,"" said sebastian hindman, an analyst at snl financial, who said jpmorganshould be able to shoulder the $31 billion writedown to wamu's portfolio.---ap business writers marcy gordon in washington and sara lepro in new york contributed to this report.",9/26/08,1,1,1,,,1

""i don't sense a high level of confidence out there. if anything, i get the opposite feeling. but the contrarian in me says that's what i want to feel like.""the worrywarts' biggest concern is corporate earnings. analysts are predicting profit gains of at least 25 percent next year, based largely on two observations. first, this year's profits were so bad that comparisons will be relatively easy. second, companies have done so much cost-cutting that any uptick in sales will be amplified on the bottom line.what if sales remain sluggish, though? banks have cut credit lines, and house prices aren't rising, so consumers aren't in the mood to spend. ""so far there isn't overwhelming evidence of companies showing top-line revenue growth,"" says gary guthrie, a senior vice president in the trust department of umb bank.milton ezrati, senior economist at lord abbett mutual funds, has a more bullish outlook. it's possible, he says, that earnings forecasts are actually too pessimistic. big international companies, with exposure to countries that are recovering more quickly than the united states, will show better revenue gains than many people expect, ezrati said.if investors merely become more confident about next year's earnings outlook, he thinks the s&amp;p 500 could rise about 7 percent from its current level. then, investors will start looking ahead to 2011, when he expects profits to grow about 10 percent.""there's always a chance of a correction,"" ezrati said, ""but as a fundamental investor we have to look at the fundamentals, and they suggest that the market is very reasonably priced.""the dow closed at 9,996 on friday after its two-day journey into 10,000 territory. it really doesn't mean much, but many investors will feel better when that big, round number recedes into the rearview mirror for good.",10/18/09,1,1,1,,,1

""it's not the fear of an event of some sort,"" such as a terrorist attack, said peter boockvar, equity strategist at miller tabak. ""it's the fear that the piece of paper in your pocket you call money will devalue over time."" to stave off a liquidity crisis last year, bernanke's fed turned on the money spigot, flooding the system -- and world -- with dollars. in the short term, that helped avert a second great depression. but in the long term, with each new dollar introduced into the system, each dollar you hold becomes worth less. that's more than just inflation, which we think of as simply rising prices. that's debasement of not only our currency, but also the globe's reserve currency. and that makes countries such as china -- which holds the greatest percentage of u.s. debt -- very nervous. ""it amazes me that any self-respecting central banker is not alarmed that gold is over $1,000 and the dollar is trading at all-time record lows,"" boockvar said. let's back up here for a minute and consider gold itself. it's a complicated metal, and people buy it for a lot of reasons that have nothing to do with what it's worth. gold is a commodity, just like soybeans or wheat. but soybeans have no romance, no feeling of permanence, no surprising heft when you lift them. spanish conquistadors did not purse the new world's soy. there was never a james bond villain called wheatfinger. gold is freighted with more meaning, really, than value. people who want something to pass down to their grandchildren, for instance, buy gold coins. people who want to diversify their investments buy gold. people who fear inflation buy gold as a hedge. but when foreign nations that hold billions of dollars in u.s. debt start buying gold because they fear the value of the dollar will go down, that's when the rising price of gold becomes more than a novelty. the massive economies of china and india, as well as several emerging economies, are increasingly hoarding gold, said michael dudas, gold analyst at jefferies asset management. the argument shared by china and by other investors who have been lending money to the united states during this crisis is simple, dudas said: ""they're looking at us and saying, 'if you keep printing too much money, what you owe me is not worth as much.' "" in periods of intense crisis, it's probably best not to use a gold-price spike as a barometer, as people do not act rationally in a crisis. but in non-panic situations, such as the one we're in now, gold is a more useful barometer. and here are two readings from the barometer: the u.s. mint has sold out of gold products in the past year. more importantly, noncommercial net long positions on gold are at an all-time high, the commodity futures trading commission said recently. translation: investors think the price of gold will keep rising.

""we can expand for a long, long time.""growth will be critical in the company's efforts to meet its targets this year. additional accounts generate more revenue, and accounts that do go bad typically do not do so right away. so an expansion in a pool of receivables can precede an increase in unrecoverable loans while suppressing a portfolio's chargeoff rate.heffernan said in an investor presentation last month that credit loss rates could ""skyrocket"" for competitors.but for alliance data, ""the difference is, the bank card industry is shrinking,"" he said. ""we are growing, not because we changed credit [standards], but because we signed retailers. we're going to skim the cream off the crop with those retailers.""some analysts accept the premise, citing chastened lending terms across the industry and the withdrawal of large credit card issuers from the hunt for new business because they were burned by excessive growth during the bubble, or because they are part of conglomerates hamstrung by problems elsewhere.""as competitors retrenched, the market is becoming more rational,"" said john grund, a partner at first annapolis consulting inc. who advises retailers on private-label cards. alliance data is ""basically looking to capitalize on areas or relationships that their competitors are either underserving or exiting.""still, the company has been dogged by doubters. last month short interest surged to over 35% of alliance data's stock float - one of the highest levels for any company in the country. robert napoli, an analyst at piper jaffray cos., said the negative bets may have reflected ""the hope that credit losses are going to blow up sometime.""napoli said he does not think that will happen.

""you're beginning to build up some steam as a mitigant to higher credit losses, and it's just a question of when we hit the point during the year where we finally fully offset it.""alliance data's february managed chargeoff rate fell 40 basis points from january, to 8.5%. at press time the company had not reported march data.growth in its credit card portfolio as measured by average receivables stalled last year, in part because of the loss of charming shoppes inc.'s lane bryant business in late 2007.in december, alliance data bought $138.9 million of receivables as a part of a deal to take over the credit card program at hsn inc. those accounts contributed to a 9.7% increase in alliance data's managed portfolio from a year earlier, to $4.3 billion in february.

""why bulk it up if they're going to have [credit] losses? i make 1,300 basis points on assets. unless you think unemployment's going to 22%, i should be buying. so we're going to take advantage of this weakness in private label, bulk it up, set it off to the side, and then when this thing passes, they're just going to have one heck of a fun run.""as of the market's close wednesday, alliance data stock had rebounded 79.6% since the investor presentation, when the company once again reiterated its projection of 17% to 18% growth in cash earnings per share this year.the company is scheduled to report its first-quarter results on april 22.analysts like napoli said they expect to see a further rise in alliance data's chargeoff rate, which increased 2.5 percentage points last year, to 7.3%. nevertheless, ""their credit losses can go up a lot more"" without stopping the company from meeting its projections, napoli said.robert dodd, an analyst at regions financial corp.'s morgan keegan &amp; co. inc., said the trends in loss rates are not as alarming as some have feared. he projects that chargeoffs will peak in the double digits in the first quarter of next year, but there's ""nothing i've seen so far that makes me worried that, instead of going to 10%, 11%, you're going to 14%, 15% or anything like that.""in the investor presentation, heffernan said an increase of 1 percentage point in his company's chargeoff rate would translate to a $40 million hit, or about 8% of projected cash earnings per share - a problem he said it could solve with a ""tweak"" to its share-repurchase program.he acknowledged in the interview, ""when times like this hit ... for sure we're going to get whacked by the macro trends in that private-label business.""alliance data's chargeoff rate is ""going to drift up probably another 50 basis points or so this year,"" he said. ""but we're not seeing the spiking that we saw last year."" and competitors whose portfolios contract are ""going to have more of a challenge to control that loss rate, because it's just a percentage.""when asked if growth would allow risks to build in an environment of rising unemployment - creating more exposure if his company had to pull back because chargeoffs accelerated more than it anticipated - heffernan said, ""if growth stops or reverses itself, we have a problem, no question about it.""however, the company is not ""picking up a bunch of portfolios so we're growing 30% a year,"" he said. ""we don't want to do that. what we want to do is grow primarily through signing of new retailers and starting programs from scratch.""for mature portfolios, about a third of a retailer's sales go through alliance data's cards, but it takes about three years to ""ramp up"" to that point, heffernan said. ""even if that retailer is doing lousy, we're still going to have very strong growth, because we're ramping up our wallet share. if that happens, then you've got basically three separate years of vintages that are growing, no matter what, and you avoid that big drop-off that could occur.""the difference between alliance data and its largest competitors in the private-label business - citigroup inc., hsbc holdings plc and general electric co. - is that they are ""by very definition"" a ""bank or finance company,"" he said. ""the services you provide are financial in nature, and that means you want a balance.""but for alliance data, which gets about half of its revenue from noncard businesses like direct marketing, ""what we're in business for is not to provide credit; it's to collect information,"" heffernan said. ""so we'll give up the big balances in return for someone who visits a pottery barn or a crate and barrel or a restoration hardware - someone like that - 20 times a year.""this year citi put its private-label card business into citi holdings, a repository created for noncore assets the new york company is seeking to sell or wind down, including $301 billion of loans, securities and unfunded commitments subject to a loss-sharing agreement with the government. at the end of last year, citi's ""retail partners"" portfolio of $56 billion represented 37% of its managed card receivables.ge said in december 2007 that it was looking for a buyer for its private-label card business. but in september the conglomerate said it planned to hold on to the unit, because of the poor environment for such a sale.in a presentation last month, ge said delinquencies in its portfolio had started to lag unemployment in the middle of last year, because of actions it started taking in early 2007 to tighten credit, though collections of overdue amounts had become progressively difficult. citing small account balances, which limit credit risk, and higher borrower pricing relative to general-purpose bank cards, mark begor, the leader of ge's credit card operation, said, ""you can see why we like this business.""ge said balances on its private-label cards averaged $620 last year.at alliance data, the average amount borrowed on cards with outstanding balances increased 9.4% last year, to $394.grund said other lenders besides alliance data could benefit during the pullback.jpmorgan chase &amp; co. ""could buy any portfolio,"" and new entrants that ""have been strong co-branders"" could dive into private label, he said. ""you've got to tread very carefully,"" because of instability in the retail sector and the ***recession**, ""but there are opportunities.""heffernan said alliance data has kept its cutoff fico score for new accounts about the same - they average around 720 - but fewer applicants qualify because credit scores have dropped as a result of the ***recession**.industry advisers said the reduced competition has also given alliance data more power in negotiating prices and other terms with partners in private-label programs.in its march presentation, ge said it had been able to extract substantial concessions on rebates and discount rate arrangements with retailers to compensate for weakened consumers.in a february conference call, heffernan said alliance data would handle a smaller share of hsn's revenue than it does with some other clients, ""primarily because the credit quality across the hsn base is quite diverse"" and includes some weaker credits. ""we do not target subprime.""",4/16/09,1,1,1,,,1
7V02-28Y1-2PG4-G00S-00000-00.txt," preparing for this year's session has been easier for house speaker chris benge. a year ago, he didn't know until the session's opening day whether he would serve in the powerful house position. benge, r-tulsa, starts his second year as speaker with the luxury of having had several weeks to prepare a legislative agenda and assign committee chairmen and members. benge, who a year ago was chairman of the house budget committee, became the gop choice to lead the republican-controlled house. then-speaker lance cargill resigned the post a week before the start of last year's session because of various tax problems. a few days later then-speaker pro tempore gus blackwell - considered the favorite to succeed cargill - took himself out of the race.  benge inherited a committee structure and committee chairmen selected by cargill. not much was done the first week of last year's session, but benge made up lost ground in subsequent weeks. ""it's been a lot better as far as just being able to have time to plan,"" he said.agenda considered benge, term-limited and unable to seek re-election, wants legislators to look at drawing up an energy plan for the state, saying oklahoma has plenty of alternative fuel sources that could blend with oklahoma's oil and gas industry. finding ways to get coverage for oklahoma's uninsured, lawsuit reform and requiring voters to present identification at polling places are key priorities benge is pushing. the state's $600 million budget shortfall will be a challenge, but it also will provide opportunities to look at ""finding fat and finding efficiencies"" in state government. house democratic leader danny morgan said his members will continue to seek legislation requiring insurance companies to provide coverage for treating autistic children. morgan, of prague, said democratic members also want to bolster careertech, which is important in retraining workers who may lose their jobs as the national ***recession** tightens its grip on oklahoma. ""there's a lot of talk about higher education right now but we believe that careertech is a way to retrain these displaced workers in a very quick fashion to get them back into the marketplace,"" morgan said.open-door policy morgan said he's optimistic benge will allow some democratic measures to get to the house floor. house democrats, who controlled the house for more than 80 years before losing control in 2004, are adjusting. ""if there's a good issue out there, our caucus will jump right in the middle with republicans and work hand-in-hand with them to develop solutions,"" morgan said. ""there will be some differences of opinion, but it won't be as rancorous on the senate side because we've had a couple years now to understand the best way to work with the majority.""",2/1/09,0,0,1,,,0
7VKG-SMP0-Y8TC-S235-00000-00.txt,"c(""wal-mart may have become the premier place to shop for americans struggling through a severe ***recession**, but the giant chain has competition nipping at its heels.  the nation's dollar stores, those once-dowdy chains that lured shoppers by selling some or all of their merchandise for $1, are suddenly hot.  they are busily opening new stores, outfitting existing stores with refrigerators and freezers, and sprucing up their aisles with better lighting, fresh paint and new signs.   and while most big retail chains are closing stores and radically cutting back on new outlets, the dollar chains are planning to open hundreds of stores this year in some of the best locations to which they have ever had access.   dollar stores have long had a reputation for being down-at-the-heels places to buy cheap, generic goods. while keeping their low prices, they are revamping their image and climbing the respectability ladder -- in some cases into the fortune 500. dollar general, long part of that select club of the 500 biggest american companies, appears on this year's list at no. 259, up 15 places from last year.   and dollar tree landed on the list for the first time, at no. 499. those rankings are a far cry from wal-mart stores, which holds the no. 2 position behind exxon mobil, but some dollar chains these days are growing faster than wal-mart.   ''when you think about the dirty dark days of dollar stores,'' said joshua braverman, a spokesman for family dollar, ''i think we've come a really long way.''  richard russell, a health care worker for an assisted-living community in east northport, n.y., said that even people who can afford to pay $5,000 a month for their parents to reside in the community are shopping at the local dollar store.  ''you go to the supermarket and you buy eggs and milk, and your money's shot,'' mr. russell said recently as he pulled a box of kraft macaroni and cheese, 85 cents, off the shelf.  the selection of merchandise at dollar stores is nowhere near that of wal-mart, of course. but mr. russell is among the consumers who said they liked shopping in a smaller store where the staff was easily accessible and the aisles tended to be less crowded.    of the nation's three major self-described dollar chains, family dollar and dollar general sell  many items for about $1 along with other merchandise that costs more. over the last year, another chain, dollar tree, tried selling items in some stores for more than $1, but sales were not impressive enough to keep the experiment alive. today, dollar tree is back to being a dollar purist.   what the three companies have in common is strong sales growth in their most recent reporting periods -- a feat in this economy, where most chains are posting declines.  for the three months ending feb. 28, sales at family dollar stores open at least a year -- a measure of retail health known as same-store sales -- increased 6.4 percent compared with last year. customer traffic, as well as the average amount of money spent at the checkout counter at family dollar, which operates more than 6,600 stores, also increased.   same-store sales for the three months ending jan. 31 increased 2.2 percent at dollar tree, which has more than 3,600 stores. timothy j. reid, vice president of investor relations for dollar tree, said the company had a 3.7 percent increase in the number of transactions in 2008 compared with the previous year.   at dollar general, which operates more than 8,400 stores, same-store sales for the three months ending jan. 30 were up 9.4 percent.   stacey widlitz, a retailing analyst with pali research, summarized the dollar-store success story: ''they're killing it because consumers are trading down.''   as a result, the chains are opening more stores and negotiating less expensive rents in better shopping centers. after all, landlords are hungry for healthy retailers to take over the empty spaces left behind by bankrupt and ailing chains.  ''we have seen a softening of the market when it comes to real estate, and certainly when you're the big dog and doing well, people want to come to you,'' said mr. braverman of family dollar. ''we plan to open 200 stores this year.''  dollar tree plans to open 235 new stores and relocate 90 existing stores. dollar general will open 450 new stores and remodel or relocate about 400 existing stores.   to capitalize on the down economy, the chains are offering more groceries and household necessities -- and giving those items more prominence in their stores.  ''all these guys are seeing more traffic and new customers than they've seen in the past,'' said joseph feldman, a retailing analyst with the telsey advisory group. ''it's clear to me that it's an attempt to capture and retain the customers that they are getting.''   some chains began making their food business a priority well before the ***recession** hit -- installing refrigerators and freezers so they could take market share from grocery stores; adding more name brands; and trying to make their stores more appealing by repainting them, improving the lighting and widening the aisles.   while most dollar store and closeout retailers said food did not make up the bulk of their sales, they said it has become an increasingly important part of their business. in its 2008 fiscal year, dollar tree added freezers and coolers to 135 stores. this year, at least 150 more stores will receive them.   mr. braverman of family dollar said the company had spent the last few years positioning itself ''for an economy such as this'' by adding more brands and a wider selection of salad dressings, pastas and sauces. last month the chain began carrying double stuf oreo cookies. family dollar also began rearranging merchandise to make its stores easier to shop. ''are the plates near the food?'' mr. braverman said. ''no? well, let's put them over there.''  more dollar stores are also accepting food stamps, which is helping drive sales. dollar tree, for instance, accepts food stamps in 2,200 of its stores today, up from 1,154 stores last year. the company expects that number to increase yet again as more of its stores receive refrigerators and freezers.   low prices are not the only reason consumers are flocking to dollar stores, though.   some go because they can get a shopping fix without doing too much damage to their wallets. but they have to be careful. ''you can spend a lot of money that you don't mean to,'' said susan fallon, during a recent trip to family dollar in east northport. a teacher and single mother of two children ages 6 and 9, she has been trying to save money by cutting back on driving, dining out, eating meat and drinking soda.  lisa defranco, a seventh-grade teaching assistant, agreed. but like many consumers she likes the convenience of shopping at a local store; the quieter, less crowded aisles; and the personal attention -- something that is often lacking at big-box discounters.   ''the man who works here is such a nice guy,'' ms. defranco said. ''they always offer to help you.''  mr. braverman of family dollar said the small-town feel of the stores appealed to many customers. and he noted another boon: ''you don't have to navigate the big-box parking lot.''

""homeowners can only take advantage of this program by taking action --- they must respond when they hear from us,"" he said.many democrats and public-interest groups have been critical of the bush administration for not doing more, sooner to address the problems tied to the subprime lending practices that flourished in 2002 through 2005.during that time, many lenders offered mortgages to ""subprime"" borrowers --- those with spotty credit histories or irregular income. typically, the loans offered low initial interest rates to hold down the monthly cost. but over time, the rates ratcheted up. over the past two years, millions of loans have been resetting to much higher rates, making it impossible for some homeowners to keep up. as a result, foreclosures have soared, driving down home prices as properties sit vacant. in 2007, home values fell nationwide for the first time since the great depression.the federal reserve estimates about 2 million more homeowners will face rising monthly payments over the next two years as their loans reset to higher interest rates.critics say the voluntary plans backed by the white house are too limited to have much of an impact on an enormous problem. for example, the center for responsible lending in washington says that in the third quarter of 2007, lenders initiated about 213,000 foreclosures on subprime loans but offered meaningful loan ""modifications"" on only 28,000.john taylor, president of the national community reinvestment coalition, dismissed the hope now efforts as inadequate.""borrowers need help now, not just more hope,"" taylor said in a statement. ""almost weekly announcements about small successes and minor program modifications confirm the program is not working.""taylor's group, composed of more than 600 community-based organizations, says it wants the federal government to purchase, at a discount, the mortgages held in securitized pools. once the government holds the loan portfolio, it could reduce all of the loan terms ""in a meaningful way to create long-term affordability,"" the group says.although paulson enthusiastically endorses the voluntary efforts the white house has been promoting, he acknowledged the problems are profound.""none of these efforts are a silver bullet that will undo the excesses of the past years,"" he said.project lifeline: how it worksthe new program from six major lenders lets qualifying homeowners ""pause"" the foreclosure process.who's participatingbank of america, chase, citigroup, wells fargo, countrywide, and washington mutual. other lenders also have been urged to join.which loans qualifyhome loans that are 90 days delinquent and that are not:* in active foreclosure with sale date less than 30 days* where the homeowner has indicated a desire to give up the home.* in active bankruptcy* investment properties* vacant propertiessteps in the process1. call your mortgage service and say you have received their letter, wish to stay in your home and want counseling.2. provide updated financial information.3. if applicable, a pending foreclosure may be paused for up to 30 days while it's reviewed and a new payment plan created.4. if the homeowner follows the new plan for three months, the loan will be formally modified.source: hope now alliance",2/13/08,1,1,1,,,1

a weaker dollar vis-a-vis other leading currencies incites sellers to require higher prices.\""this weekend is going to be very important. i think hopefully cooler heads will prevail and we can see a sell-off\"" next week, said phil flynn, an oil futures expert at alaron trading in chicago. \""the leaders of the world need to step up and acknowledge what happened here.\""the oil-producing cartel opec could help calm the markets and reduce supply fears, he said, by talking about boosting production.at the pentagon, officials said that while israel had made its concern about iran's nuclear ambitions known, u.s. officials had no \""specific information\"" that israel was planning an attack. the united states also has no pending plans, pentagon leaders said.\""i am not aware of any effort by the u.s. military to assist in or conduct any military strikes against iran,\"" said a senior u.s. military official, who asked for anonymity to speak candidly.adding to the glum news for motorists, investment bank morgan stanley predicted $150-a-barrel oil by the fourth of july, and should a major hurricane hit production in the gulf of mexico, the sky could be the limit on oil prices.americans are virtually assured now of paying far more than $4 a gallon for gasoline. the nationwide average, according to the aaa motor club, was already $3.98 on friday afternoon, and that didn't reflect a $15-a-barrel rise in oil prices thursday and friday, which could tack on an additional 15 cents to a gallon of gasoline.as oil headed up, stocks dropped sharply. the dow jones industrial average plunged 394.64 points to 12,209.21, while the s&amp;p 500 skidded 43.37 points to 1,360.68. the tech-heavy nasdaq was off 75.38 points to 2,474.56.the takeaway for ordinary americans is this: already facing high energy prices, weak income growth and rising prices at the grocery store, they can add job security and ***recession** to their list of economic concerns.\""***recession** is written all over the jobs numbers. the job losses are significant and broad across many industries and areas of the country,\"" mark zandi, the chief economist for forecaster moody's economy.com, told mcclatchy newspapers.the surge in the unemployment rate probably overstates the job-market weakening in may, he said, because it could reflect college students looking for work early because they know it will be tougher to find jobs this summer.\""nonetheless, the job market is eroding and so too is the broader economy,\"" zandi said.president bush spoke briefly about the economy friday, using a swearing-in ceremony for his new housing secretary to say that the unemployment numbers were skewed by a larger-than-usual number of young people seeking employment. in a move that could affect the presumptive republican presidential nominee, sen. john mccain, bush offered no remedies to the economic problems, just politics.bush called on democrats in congress to pass legislation to allow more oil drilling in u.s. waters, and repeated his call to keep the tax cuts he moved through congress in 2001 and 2003.\""congress needs to send a clear message that the tax relief we passed needs to be made permanent,\"" he said.neither of these issues will fix problems americans are facing. oil is a globally traded commodity, so adding more barrels here _ which would take years at best _ would help a bit eventually but is unlikely to have a great impact on global supplies. the president's tax cuts expire at the end of 2010; eliminating uncertainty about their future wouldn't much affect anyone's well-being now.bush didn't mention the commodity futures trading commission, the federal body that regulates trading in oil contracts, which created an uproar last week by acknowledging that it was investigating the possible manipulation of oil prices by speculators.adding to friday's grim news was the u.s. dollar's slumping again. earlier this week, federal reserve chairman ben bernanke caused a stir by stressing the importance of a strong dollar, a task historically reserved for the treasury secretary. his words helped the greenback regain some ground temporarily but it fell friday against the euro, which traded at $1.577 to the dollar.by talking up the dollar and watching it fall, bernanke showed how little control policy-makers have over the currency's value.the fed also is sure to find the jobs report troubling. when the economy slumps, monetary policy-makers usually want to cut interest rates to spark it. but bernanke and other fed leaders are increasingly hawkish about inflation threats, which argue for rate hikes.the soaring oil prices are sure to push inflation even higher as the costs of oil and related products cascade through the manufacturing supply chain all the way to the cash register for consumers.friday's jobs data pointed to a continuing trend. the leading job-losing industries were construction and manufacturing, reflecting the slowdown in the housing and building sectors and weakening consumer demand as paychecks are stretched. the top job-creating sectors were education and health services.___(mcclatchy newspapers pentagon correspondent nancy a. youssef contributed to this article.)___(c) 2008, mcclatchy-tribune information services.visit the mcclatchy washington bureau on the world wide web at www.mcclatchydc.com._____graphics (from mct graphics, 202-383-6064): 20080606 unemployment, 20080606 dow 15 min.for reprints, email tmsreprints@permissionsgroup.com, call 800-374-7985 or 847-635-6550, send a fax to 847-635-6968, or write to the permissions group inc., 1247 milwaukee ave., suite 303, glenview, il 60025, usa."",

7X75-4KK1-2PVM-D1Y0-00000-00.txt,"he apologized for having a wild-game potluck retirement party nov. 21 while some hunting and fishing seasons were still under way. ""i don't want to take from anybody's time in the field,"" john andrews said, indicating his sensitivity to the passions of one constituency he's served. the 59-year-old wildlife biologist has learned how highly sportsmen prize weekends during those seasons, which in some cases have become shorter and more restricted since he followed his father's footsteps 35 years ago into what is now the washington department of fish and wildlife. andrews is stepping down this week as the agency's regional manager for the state's 10 easternmost counties. his career has spanned considerable progress for wildlife conservation, although he noted the job will never be finished. ""wolf management and a challenging budget climate are just two of the major issues the next managers will have to deal with,"" andrews said. he's lived the wildlife protector's dream, starting with fish sampling out of neah bay and then pursuing poachers and dealing with nuisance beavers, raccoons, skunks and bears out of yakima. he transferred to spokane and settled into a routine that included more office work as well as banding geese and releasing wild turkeys, camping out in the snow to monitor deer hunters and streaking along the treetops in low-flying aircraft to net endangered mountain caribou. in 1999, he was named manager for the agency's far-east side region. the promotion pretty much removed him from the field but intensified his impact in managing wild critters - and brokering their well-being with the sportsmen, tribes, farmers, developers, politicians and other groups who have a stake in their existence. ""(andrews) is great to work with, very people oriented, knowledgeable - and he keeps his word,"" said ken hoff, president of the spokane-based inland northwest wildlife council. ""some people promise something and you never hear from them again. that's not john. on the other hand, he doesn't promise what he can't deliver."" when a cougar attacked a youngster in pend oreille county this fall, andrews was quickly on the phone to county commissioners. ""he was very good about calling me right away to let me know what the department was doing,"" said commissioner john hankey. ""it was very good of him. i feel we're going to miss him."" beyond good communication, andrews' management philosophy is simple: ""i try to approach wildlife issues sincerely, realizing that everybody's opinion is important. there's always a range in science and biology. it's not all black and white."" in recent years, the job has become a task of doing more with less. washington's ***economic crisis** initially forced the fish and wildlife department to cut $22 million from its budget and 76 staff positions this year while mothballing another 87 vacant positions. agency administrators agonized over which staff and functions to eliminate, he said. and more cuts are expected. as regional manager, andrews has been overseeing about 135 staffers in 10 counties. last year, he traveled roughly 25,000 miles to meetings, including 15 trips to olympia as the region's representative for wildlife issues. he's worked under seven agency directors. ""the agency is larger than when i started,"" he said. ""on the other hand, the legal complexities and demands on the agency have grown much faster than the staff."" fishermen are heavily regulated, but one ill-conceived shoreline development can threaten more fish than an opening-day crowd of anglers, he noted. ""our regional office takes 250 phone calls a day on our public line alone from people asking questions or requesting services,"" he said. ""we take that seriously, and it's in addition to our regular jobs. ""there's a big demand for the work we do."" wildlife managers address their huge responsibility with limited authority, he said. while the fish and wildlife department manages about 900,000 acres in washington, most of the state's wildlife habitat is controlled by other agencies, timber companies, farmers, ranchers and other private landowners. ""increasing human population has been a slow but steady impact to what i call open spaces that are important to fish and wildlife and also to people,"" he said. ""the agency is trying to develop more partnerships with groups, businesses and agencies to get the job done. ""indian tribes are co-managers of many of our natural resources and we work together on things that are mutually important, with fish and wildlife being at the heart of it. we get a lot more done working together."" andrews calls his career with the department ""a privilege and a pleasure."" ""while enjoyable, it's also hard work to blend the science and biology of fish and wildlife conservation with management and enforcement programs that incorporate the many different viewpoints,"" he said. even in retirement he'll be working for wildlife with four states and several tribes in wildlife mitigation negotiations through the columbia basin fish &amp; wildlife authority under the bonneville power administration. but he said nothing will replace the special bond with his wildlife-professional peers, since virtually all of them have had a passion for fish and critters since they were kids. the public generally shares the sentiments, he said. ""people who left europe and established the original colonies made a point that the deer on this land were not the king's deer; they belonged to the people,"" he said. ""americans have had a strong interest in fish and wildlife from the start.""2 sidebars:1. perks and perils  of the job  wildlife biologists' jobs range from the hands-on outdoor work that lures them into the profession to the indoor tedium of compiling data and attending public meetings that prompts some of them to exit.  in between, john andrews has had some notable adventures, including one of the 1980s forays into canada to capture mountain caribou for relocation in the u.s. portion of the selkirk mountains.  when fog grounded the operation at a helicopter skiing resort in british columbia, the international group of biologists spent three days with a large contingent of grounded skiers from norway, including crown prince harald v, who became king in 1991.  ""we all called him harald to the aghast of his group but he loved visiting with us and spent a great deal of time playing cards and having a few brews with the caribou biologists,"" andrews recalled.  after surviving his first exposure to the bare realities of taking a sauna european style, the weather cleared and andrews and the other biologists got serious.""it's very dangerous work net gunning big-game while flying through sub-alpine forests, but we got our caribou and delivered them to the states,"" he said.2. a changing  wildlife landscape john andrews' 35-year career as a state wildlife biologist has spanned a considerable range of changes in washington. among them: *in 1974, federal judge george boldt issues a historic ruling affirming native american treaty fishing rights and allocating 50 percent of the annual salmon catch to treaty tribes. *wildlife biologists get more legal clout in state shoreline regulations and growth management. *""resource allocation,"" enacted in 1984, requires deer and elk hunters to choose a weapon - archery, muzzleloader or modern rifle - before buying a tag. *lead shot banned for hunting waterfowl in 1991. *departments of game and fisheries merge into one agency in 1994. *wild turkeys successfully introduced in washington. *decline of blue mountains elk herd, which attracted about 18,000 hunters in the late 1970s before spike-management restrictions. last year's hunter estimate: 4,000. *boom in farmers enrolling in conservation reserve program during the 1990s. *lower snake river compensation plan secures fish hatcheries and wildlife habitat through the u.s. army corps of engineers to help mitigate some of the wildlife losses caused by four dams; salmon and steelhead recovery plans adopted. *peregrine falcon removed from the federal list of threatened and endangered species in 1999; bald eagle de-listed in 2007. *sage and sharp-tailed grouse listed as threatened in washington in 1998. *trapping and hunting bears and cougars with hounds restricted or banned by state initiative. *about 60 moose roamed in northeastern washington in 1974. this year's estimate: 1,500-2,000. *exotic species such as walleye, smallmouth bass and northern pike take root in region's waters. *special youth hunting seasons adopted. *major regional land acquisitions, guided by new emphasis on prioritizing prime wildlife habitat, include the swanson lakes wildlife area in lincoln county, thousands of acres of elk range in the blue mountains and, most recently, a prime wildlife area along the west branch of the little spokane river. *first two breeding wolf packs confirmed in more than 60 years. *washington's human population increases from 3.5 million in 1974 to more than 6.5 million.",11/29/09,0,0,1,,,0

upfront costs.the two most popular projects in new jersey -- solar panel installations and more recently, wind farms -- are expensive even with government incentives, some of which are being pulled back.\""emerging technology and other long-range investments are often the first to suffer when the economy turns,\"" said frank felder director of the center for energy, economic &amp; environmental policy at rutgers university. \""if it's harder to get capital, then those [green] projects won't be a priority for either business or consumers.\""those investing in large projects admit that it would be difficult to build right now.executives at garden state offshore wind said they would probably have a hard time securing the $1.1 billion needed to build new jersey's first 96 wind turbines. environmental studies and regulatory hurdles will push off a huge capital expenditure by 18 months, company executives said.\""hopefully by then the credit markets will be in better shape,\"" said paul rosengren, a spokesman for newark-based public service enterprise group, a partner in garden state offshore wind. \""it would probably inhibit us if we were in the construction phase today.\""yet the long-term economic benefit of wind power is palpable since no fuel is needed. the atlantic county utilities authority has saved $500,000 a year in electric costs from five wind turbines -- the largest wind farm in the state -- that help power its wastewater treatment facility.nationally, billionaire oilman t. boone pickens delayed a plan to develop a wind farm on thousands of acres in west texas, citing the drop in natural gas prices last month, bp solar scrapped plans for a $97 million expansion of its frederick, md., plant citing intense global competition. and the nation's second-largest ethanol company is under bankruptcy protection.on the consumer and small business end, converting to renewable energy is costly even with government incentives. solar panels and geothermal heat pumps can cost tens of thousands of dollars to buy and install in homes and small buildings.but new jersey consumers may no longer enjoy generous state rebates that paid up to 70 percent of installation costs. because they will still be able to write 30 percent of the purchase price off their taxes thanks to a provision in the $700 billion federal bank bailout bill, the state board of public utilities is considering severely reducing rebates, according to a bpu notice for public comment issued oct. 30.since 2001, it has offered rebates of up to 70 percent of construction costs to homeowners and businesses. a typical residential solar installation costs $48,000 to $60,000, although some small systems cost less than $20,000.without the state taxpayer-funded incentive, there may be a slowdown in what has been a burgeoning business in new jersey.more than 3,300 homes, businesses, school and government buildings have installed solar panels in new jersey, the second most in the nation behind california. much of it was propelled by the $233 million given by the bpu to businesses and residents since 2001.\""the rebate is very important to the solar industry,\"" said thomas matulewicz, a partner in geogenix, a solar installation company in monmouth county. \""the market really took off when it was introduced.\""the bpu has begun shifting to market driven incentives by requiring the state's electric utilities to buy renewable energy certificates from consumers who generate enough electricity from solar panels.\""the jury is still out on whether this will have the same impact\"" as rebates, said david pringle of the new jersey environmental federation, an advocacy group. \""the rebates were known and proven.\""state officials have long pushed the cost-saving benefits of projects like solar power, but admit that may not be enough to entice consumers right now.\""in the short term, people aren't spending money anywhere,\"" said jeanne fox, president of the state board of public utilities. \""everyone hopes this passes quickly. people will still use electricity regardless and renewable energy will eventually save money.\""but with small businesses clamoring for loans just to make ends meet, long-term energy savings will not be a priority, rutgers' felder said.\""small businesses are usually short for credit,\"" he said \""if they can't meet payroll, they're not going to put $30,000 or $40,000 out for a capital investment like solar panels.\""despite the gloomy short-term outlook, green technology is still seen by many as a skyrocketing business sector. a recent clean energy conference in jersey city drew 900 attendees, many of whom were bullish on renewable energy. while projects may stall in the short term, many said the long-term outlook is good.renewable energy's biggest champion at the conference was governor corzine.\""we are going to have to stay the course with these issues and that will take public investment and public policy to make sure that we are committed to renewable energy and efficiency,\"" he said at the conference. \""we're going to sustain our sustainability efforts in new

retrain workers in the building trades with energy efficiency skills.if things get worse, felder said, green jobs could be a panacea to the economy, much like public works jobs were during the great

7V4J-FST1-2R2Y-7381-00000-00.txt,"c(""feb. 28--london -- unions and parliamentarians are protesting at a decision by the british government to award a multi-billion pound train contract to a consortium led by a japanese company.they are angry that 30 percent of the contract to build a new fleet of express trains will be spent at hitachi ltd.'s plant in kasado, yamaguchi prefecture, when there is a british-based manufacturer who could carry out all the work here, thereby securing existing jobs and those in the supply chain.the criticism represents growing concern amongst british workers and unions that foreign companies are taking work from home-grown firms which are battling to stay afloat during the ***recession**.in february, it was announced that agility trains ltd. -- a consortium comprising hitachi of japan, john laing and barclays private equity -- was the government's \""preferred bidder\"" for a 7.5 billion pounds ($10.74 billion) contract to supply britain's intercity rail network with a fleet of hitachi super express trains.the government said hitachi was the best firm for the job despite the fact that the unsuccessful bidder, canadian-owned bombardier, already has a manufacturing base in derby, central england, and is in need of new contracts, according to the town's member of parliament.derby's local newspaper is running a campaign to change the government's mind and award the contract to bombardier -- britain's only train maker -- which currently employs 2,200 people and a further 10,000 in the local supply chain.perhaps conscious of the criticism the award would attract, agility has been keen to point out that 70 percent of the new contract will be spent in britain.hitachi plans to build a new plant in britain and create 2,500 skilled engineering jobs in train manufacturing, construction and maintenance. the firm is also in discussion with 20 british firms to supply components and services, and estimates a further 10,000 jobs will be safeguarded or created in the supply chain and local service sector.this, however, has not been enough to silence opponents.derby parliamentarian bob laxton points out that the first 70 coaches will be made entirely in kasado, and the shells of the remaining 1,330 carriages will be shipped to britain for fitting out.given this fact, he questions how hitachi can claim that 10,000 supply-chain jobs will be created in britain and he is now seeking further clarification.opponents have rubbished claims by transport secretary geoff hoon that the move will allow britain to benefit from japanese technology and become a european center-of-excellence, in a similar way to the advantages accrued to the british automobile industry with the arrival of such japanese brands as nissan, toyota and honda.as laxton says, all the design and high-tech work will be carried out in japan.\""as a member of parliament for derby, i'm just making the case that we already have a facility in britain for making trains. hitachi will also be looking for taxpayer assistance for any new plant it builds,\"" he told kyodo news.bob crow, general secretary of the national union of rail, maritime and transport workers, criticized the award of the contract to hitachi, saying that it would be another blow to the country's already weak train-making capacity.\""if japan can manage to ensure that the high-speed fleet that operates on its own railways are manufactured entirely at home, there is no earthly reason why britain cannot either,\"" he said in a statement.daniela karthaus, for hitachi europe ltd., said that while as much of the manufacturing as possible would take place in britain, the technology used for constructing the bodywork was only available in japan. the company has used complex models to estimate that 10,000 supply-chain jobs in britain will be safeguarded, she added.this is the first big train contract hitachi has won in europe and provides \""a huge opportunity for us to build a manufacturing site in the u.k. and hopefully take it as the starting point for more contracts to be won in europe,\"" she added.christian wolmar, a writer on britain's rail system, said he was \""fairly phlegmatic\"" over the award of the contract to a japanese firm, arguing that bombardier would have probably carried out some of the manufacturing overseas if it had won.he said hitachi was a strong candidate and would \""undoubtedly\"" supply a good product.as to hitachi's aspirations to provide trains to the european union market, wolmar was more doubtful, adding that some continental countries were \""much more protectionist even if they don't want to admit it.\"" agility is currently the \""preferred bidder\"" and is now consulting with the government on the contract, which is expected to be signed and sealed within a few months. in the meantime, bombardier is being held as \""reserve bidder\"" in case negotiations with agility break down.the new trains will start to be delivered for britain's main rail lines in 2013 and it is envisaged the contract will finish by 2018. the new trains will be more reliable, provide extra seats and are lighter than the current fleet, which is around 30 years old.to see more of kyodo news international, go to http://www.kyodonews.com copyright (c) 2009, kyodo news international, tokyo distributed by mcclatchy-tribune

""there's a strong desire on the part of many companies to attract capital from international investors.""those investors carry a lot of weight. pension funds and other large institutional investors oversaw   $142 trillion in assets in 2006, reports the organization for  economic co-operation and development.more of those funds -- led by calpers (california public employees' retirement system) and tiaa-cref in the usa and the hermes pension fund in the united kingdom -- are wielding their financial clout in the name of shareholders.dozens of countries are developing systems of watchdog corporate-governance and shareholder activism, with some modeling themselves after u.s. and united kingdom governance practices or the sarbanes-oxley act, the u.s. anti-fraud law passed after the enron accounting scandal six years ago led to the demise of the company.south africa, italy and japan, for instance, have recently beefed up their corporate-governance codes to strengthen shareholders' oversight of corporate boards, pay practices, accounting and auditing policies and other watchdog issues.while corporate-governance experts say there's still a long way to go, activist investors appear to be making progress globally on key issues, from clearer financial disclosure to winning a greater voice for shareholders in determining executives' pay packages.shareholders make gainsin the united kingdom, shareholders gained clout in policymaking with passage of the landmark companies act of 2006, which went into force last year. among other provisions: severance pay for a director needs approval by shareholders  if it's more than twice the director's annual salary.in australia, where investors gained the right to cast advisory votes on executive pay practices in 2005, shareholders of the country's top 200 companies tallied a record 22% dissenting votes against company pay proposals and other resolutions last year, riskmetrics group reports.last june, in a big leap forward for the european union, the european commission signed new rules that require even the most secretive of publicly traded companies to communicate more openly with shareholders. companies must allow electronic voting, notify investors of annual meetings and answer shareholders' questions.""for many countries, corporate governance is at the top of their business agenda,"" says anne simpson, executive director of the international corporate governance network (icgn), a london-based group of large investors in 30 countries with $20 trillion in assets. ""the conduct of companies is everyone's concern.""institutional investors are gradually making progress and learning to adapt their tactics to different business cultures.take calpers, the largest u.s. public pension fund, which has sparked a shareholders' movement in japan, the world's no. 2 economy after the usa.in the 1990s, calpers began investing in japanese companies on the tokyo stock exchange and lobbying aggressively for corporate-governance reform to break the stranglehold of the keiretsu, the secretive clubby network of japanese corporate giants that dominate industries and stack boards with insiders.but the japanese business establishment rebuffed the foreign investors, and calpers' hard-charging style met with limited success, according to management professor sanford jacoby at ucla's anderson school of business.now, rather than embarrass poorly performing companies with media publicity, calpers meets quietly with other pension-fund managers and large investors -- including the pension fund association, japan's largest pension fund, with more than $100 billion in assets -- to gain allies.among other changes, they're seeking more directors of japanese boards who are independent of management, greater financial disclosure and the elimination of anti-takeover defenses that protect poorly run corporations. calpers has $1 billion invested in japanese companies such as matsushita and kenwood, and that number is likely to rise, says dennis brown, senior portfolio manager at calpers.about 21% of calpers' $255 billion in assets under management are foreign stock holdings in 52 countries. the pension fund also is researching south korea and south africa for potential investments.""we're still in the very early stages of global advancement in corporate governance,"" brown says. ""a tremendous amount of work needs to be done.""why is global corporate governance taking off now?corporate scandals in the usa and other countries have led to corporate reform laws such as the usa's sarbanes-oxley, aiming to strengthen corporate-governance rules.shareholders have suffered many billions of dollars in losses from major business scandals in recent years involving engineering firm siemens in germany, the parmalat food-and-dairy company in italy, energy giant royal dutch shell in the netherlands, china aviation oil in singapore and other foreign firms.""there's no question that the enrons and worldcoms of the world have heightened the need for better governance, and that momentum has carried all over the globe,"" says reena aggarwal, a georgetown university finance professor. ""everybody is trying to get their governance practices straight.""global markets linkedshareholders and companies also realize that the global financial markets are more closely linked than ever before, especially after the asian ***financial crisis** in the late 1990s led to debt crises in many countries and hastened the collapse of u.s. hedge fund long-term capital management.nor is shareholder activism likely to wane. tens of millions of retiring workers in major economies will continue to feed the growth of activist pension and investment funds. thousands of formerly state-run companies in asia, russia, latin america and other regions will need much oversight as they join the financial markets and seek investors.advocates of tougher corporate governance face formidable hurdles, of course.while shareholders fight for independent company boards and financial disclosure, many smaller economies abroad are dominated by family-run business dynasties such as the wallenberg group in sweden or the noboa conglomerate in ecuador, says randall morck, a business professor at the university of alberta.""you've got these old-moneyed family firms that are extremely powerful, especially in countries with relatively weak corporate-governance laws and unrealized accounting disclosure rules,"" morck says. ""they have tiny financial stakes, but huge voting power with multiple votes per share.""kayla gillan, a founding member of the public company  accounting oversight board, fears that protectionist politicians and legislation, such as an anti-takeover law just passed by hungary, will ""limit the ability of (foreign) investors to influence some countries and politicians.""some overseas businesses simply fail to put corporate-governance policies into practice. while some european companies boast of having independent directors, the directors often have hidden business and family ties to companies, says mauro guillen, director of the wharton school's lauder institute and a leading expert on corporate-governance issues in europe.""there's been some convergence but mostly superficial,"" guillen says.some countries follow the west's lead in corporate-governance oversight and enforcement. much of china's securities market rules are modeled after those in the usa and u.k., plus the governance guidelines of the organization for economic cooperation and development.the china securities regulatory commission (csrc), which oversees china's 1,400 publicly listed companies, requires firms to follow a code of conduct, file quarterly and annual reports and follow tougher accounting rules based on international standards.but as china's financial markets grow at a rapid pace, the regulator faces many obstacles, including corruption, directors controlled by company owners and family-run firms fronted by ""puppets"" of the real shareholders, according to daochi tong, the csrc's deputy director-general, in an article on icgn's  website, www.icgn.org.the sec and business groups also are pushing to merge u.s. and global accounting standards to make it easier for companies to invest in other countries.""right now, the system is a maze of interpreted and reinterpreted rules,"" says david hirschmann, vice president of the u.s. chamber of commerce. ""with the capital markets going global and people investing across borders, you need one set of accounting standards to function efficiently.""industry self-policing and government enforcement are monstrous tasks, though, with auditors and investigators overwhelmed by the thousands of companies they must monitor. and countries with long histories of corrupt judges and politicians could take decades, if ever, to build western-style legal systems.that leaves corporate-governance practices as a quick fix to make executives more accountable to shareholders. more often than not, countries and companies find that strong governance reassures shareholders and ultimately boosts their stock markets and economies, according to aggarwal.""you need some level of governance, and only then will investors come in,"" she says. ""and when investors come in, they demand better disclosure and transparency. it feeds on itself."" ",2/18/08,0,0,1,,,0

4RN9-V8T0-TWX3-M19X-00000-00.txt,"it may not have been the nuclear armageddon on wall street that many predicted.but yesterday's 128-point drop in the dow was nevertheless the exclamation point on the end of the stock market's worst-ever 14-session start of a new year - a 10 percent plunge that helped erase all the gains of the last 15 months.and what really matters is this: the underlying reasons for the steep drop will surely hit you right in the wallet - the growing near-certainty that the u.s. economy will go into a ***recession** in 2008, if it's not there already. and that will make it harder for you to sell your home or find a new job this year, among other things.last night, u.s. news &amp; world report reported that washington's point man on the economy, federal reserve chief ben bernanke, is privately gloomier about the economy than in public, that the first half of 2008 will be ""bad,"" and the recovery will be slow because of the depressed housing market.the report came hours after the bernanke-led fed slashed a key interest rate by a larger-than-expected three-quarters of a point, to stop the bleeding before the stock exchange opened.so what does it mean for you? here are some questions and answers:q: are we in a ***recession**, and what does that mean anyway?a: technically, a ***recession** is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. the last time that happened was in 2001, shortly after the dot-com stock bubble burst - but it's hard for economists to know for sure until a ***recession** is just about over.most importantly, a ***recession** brings a cycle of slower consumer spending, which means more layoffs - even the once high-flying yahoo! is letting people go now - and less hiring. it usually means little or no inflation, but that's not happening right now, thanks to oil at close to $90 a barrel.q: why now?a: there's no simple answer - the economy has always been cyclical. but the most obvious culprit is too many bad loans, especially to help new homebuyers qualify for mortgages - including riskier kinds with adjustable rates - as housing prices exploded this decade. it was reported last night the rate of mortgage foreclosures in california soared by 421 percent over the course of 2007.q: why can't washington do something?a: well, it missed its chance to crack down on shoddy mortgage lending. now, its approach for the first half of 2008 seems to be writing everybody a check - as much as $1,600 for working couples - although we won't know all the details of the stimulus plan until president bush and congress work them out over the next week or so.q: wow, is fixing the economy that simple?a: uh, no. . . . many experts think the plan is too little and too late. economist jared bernstein wrote last night on the tpm cafe blog that the plan is ""inequitable, but it's also ineffective"" - not getting enough dollars to the middle-class folks who will spend the checks when they arrive. and gas will still be more than $3 a gallon, and while interest rates are going down, few consumers seem eager to borrow any money right now.q: well, has the bottom in the stock market come at least?a: who knows? for an official ""bear market,"" the dow would have to drop another 700 points. it may depend on the stability of several large but obscure bond underwriters who backed all those bad loans and are now said to be in trouble. q: but most of my retirement money is in a 401k plan tied to the stock market. should i do something?a: almost certainly not. after such a steep decline, selling stocks just means locking in your losses, while holding on for the long haul means you will benefit when they ultimately rebound.""my basic advice is don't panic, and don't worry too much, because we've seen this before,"" top d.c.-based money manager michael k. farr said in a phone interview. he acknowledged that those nearing retirement should have their assets in more risk-adverse plans, less weighted to stocks, but the timing of any move should not be dictated by wall street's wild swings.q: what about the value of my house?a: that could well decline over the next year, if it hasn't already. but just like your stock portfolio, any losses are only on paper right now unless you sell.josh slaybaugh, president of trade up 1031, a real-estate-investment firm in suburban west chester, says that he expects local home prices will suffer over the next six to 12 months but that the impact won't be nearly as great as markets like orange county, calif., or boston that saw a high run-up.""in those markets, the highs were higher so the lows will be lower,"" he said. * ",1/23/08,1,1,1,,,1

""i feel a profound peace when i've spent an entire evening with my kids and husband at the park not spending a cent.""whether they have been motivated or forced by economic events, many families have developed more frugal lifestyles. the big question is whether that newfound frugality will stick as conditions slowly improve.various national surveys and interviews with utahns suggest frugality is here to stay because the downturn has been deep enough to produce long-lasting change in consumer habits. a poll of more than 2,000 adults conducted last month for citigroup inc.found that 63 percent of american consumers said the ***recession** has permanently altered their spending and savings habits, which include cutting back on everyday expenses, using credit cards less, reducing debt, and saving and investing more. only one-third said they would go back to previous, less-desirable financial habits in better times.another study, by the research firm alixpartners suggests that americans will spend at only about 86 percent of their pre-downturn levels.economist jeff thredgold, a consultant to zions bank in salt lake city, believes consumers are likely to remain frugal for years to come for a variety of reasons.many people have been stung by job loss and pay cuts, but also by a drop in home prices and troubles on wall street, he said. he thinks the rampant consumer spending of the past half-dozen or so years was fueled not by huge jumps in family incomes, but with money from the run-up in home prices and the stock market.wealth achieved through real estates and equities can make people feel so good about their financial situations -- even if their gains are all on paper -- that they spend more freely. but that ""wealth effect"" can work in reverse. those who have seen the value of their homes and investments plummet often cut back dramatically, even if their incomes have remained the same.although the stock market in recent months has advanced well beyond its low point from earlier this year, it could take years for many people's portfolios to reach pre-crash levels. and housing prices? in most areas of the country, including utah, they aren't expected to budge much in the coming years.""living through the worst ***economic downturn** since the great depression has really changed the way people manage their finances, and that's likely going to stay with us for a while,"" thredgold said.it is often only when people experience something firsthand that they really learn long-lasting lessons and change habits. many families with a lot of debt and a little savings found out during hard times just how truly catastrophic that combination can be, and many appear poised to do whatever it takes to ensure it doesn't happen again.credit counselors say they have preached for years the basic concept of setting aside several months of living expenses as a buffer in the event of a job loss or other financial setback. yet many families have opted not to do that in favor of spending on high-tech gadgets, vacations and newer vehicles.""i think the biggest thing this ***recession** has done is proved the importance of developing solid money management habits and developing emergency savings,"" said jennifer rohn of credit-counseling firm aaa fair credit foundation,although rohn and others are hopeful that consumers have learned how to better manage their finances, others are doubtful that those who have been forced to cut back during the ***recession** will stick with their frugal ways.anna florin of south jordan said she has a free-spending friend who cut out expenses such as cable tv once he lost his job. but she noticed that as soon as he started work again, he went back to all the luxuries he enjoyed before.""he made it through the tough times, but he didn't stick with what he learned,"" she said.

4R3J-KY80-TW8F-G0XY-00000-00.txt,"as chief executive of bhp billiton, charles w. goodyear was fond of showing investors and journalists a chart of commodities prices dating back to the war of 1812 -- the ''200-year view,'' it was entitled.  the current boom in commodities, led by china, is comparable to the industrial revolution and the great rebuilding after world war ii, he would explain. during both those periods, his chart illustrated, commodities prices enjoyed roughly 25-year runs.   ''do we think that china is going to be a place that's going to be a significant resource consumer for the next 20 to 30 years? the answer is yes, we do,'' mr. goodyear said in 2005. ''and the c.e.o. sitting here 30 years from now is going to be glad that we had our tentacles in that market supplying that huge demand. i have no doubt about that.''   of course, a different chief executive is already sitting in mr. goodyear's seat, marius kloppers; and bhp, the world's largest mining company, is trying to wrap its tentacles around another big supplier to china, rio tinto. while some have been quick to hail bhp's $140 billion bid for rio as kloppers's attempt to put his own stamp on the company, mr. goodyear's fingerprints are clear.  indeed, though mr. goodyear announced plans in february to retire, company officials say he is still hard at work at bhp's melbourne headquarters.  brought to bhp after the asian ***financial crisis** sucked the air out of the last commodities boom 10 years ago, mr. goodyear was appointed chief executive in 2003, after bhp's board deemed his predecessor, brian p. gilbertson, too eager to shop for new assets. china's rise has changed all that, and it caught bhp and the rest of the industry off guard, creating shortages of equipment and labor that have raised costs and contributed to surging commodity prices.   mr. goodyear found himself in an unexpected role: having to convince not only investors and analysts, but also wary senior executives who owed their careers to toeing the conservative line, that the company needed to reverse course and spend heavily to increase production. and what it could not mine, it would need to buy.  ''you go back 10 years, and they were trying to do the same thing, and they blew themselves up,'' neil goodwill, an analyst with goldman sachs jbwere, said before bhp's bid for rio was announced. most analysts are now barred from commenting publicly on the deal, potentially the largest ever, as their firms are either advising the two companies or bidding to do so.  while rio tinto rejected bhp's initial bid as too low, bhp said it planned to keep trying to get rio to the negotiating table. many analysts expected bhp to raise its all-stock offer of three shares for every share of rio tinto, either pledging more shares or adding cash to the mix.  if the two companies were combined, they would be a $350 billion giant with control of more than a third of the global iron ore market. it would own almost 90 percent of the largest copper mine in the world, escondida in chile, as well as the largest underground mine in australia, olympic dam, which contains the largest known uranium deposit in the world. australia has already signed an agreement to export uranium to china, which is building nuclear power plants to offset its increasing imports of oil.  this is not the first time bhp has tried to take over rio. mr. goodyear's predecessor, mr. gilbertson, approached rio about the possibility of a merger shortly after bhp's merger in 2001 with billiton of britain. rio rejected that proposal, too. but the unapproved overture to rio drove a wedge between mr. gilbertson and bhp's board, resulting in his resignation. bhp's chairman, don argus, promoted mr. goodyear from chief financial officer to the top slot, calling him back from a ski vacation to take over.  mr. goodyear surprised the market in 2005 when bhp paid $7 billion in cash for a rival, wmc resources. bhp bought at a time when many thought commodity prices had peaked; even mr. goodyear had said a year earlier that most mining assets looked overvalued.  along with mr. goodyear, one of the architects of that deal was mr. kloppers, a protege of mr. gilbertson's. after mr. goodyear announced his intention to retire in february, mr. kloppers began assuming a higher profile, even serving as co-chairman of the company's annual results presentation in august. mr. kloppers was careful not to tip his hand on the subject of mergers and acquisitions, saying only that ''we will opportunistically execute m.&amp; a. where it makes sense, as we've done before.''

4RJS-1GN0-TW87-N0JR-00000-00.txt,"just at the moment the u.s. economy could use a boost, the recent surge in oil prices is having the opposite effect.even though more economists are calling for a stimulus package of spending increases or tax cuts to keep the u.s. economy out of ***recession**, climbing oil prices since september have had all the negative effects of a tax increase -- one big enough to outweigh any likely stimulus.the more-than-$30-a-barrel increase in oil prices over the past five months is like a $150 billion tax increase, said william d. nordhaus, a yale university economics professor. by paying more for oil, americans have less left to save or spend. ""it is clearly contractionary,"" nordhaus said.kenneth rogoff, a harvard university economics professor and former chief economist at the international monetary fund, made a similar estimate. ""the price of oil rising even from $80 to $100 a barrel is like adding $150 billion in taxes,"" he said. ""it's quite a wallop.""that, rogoff said, ""is far bigger than any fiscal stimulus being discussed in washington at the moment."" moreover, he said, ""it's worse than a tax increase because the money is going to saudi arabia and russia rather than the u.s. government.""rogoff estimated that the increase in oil prices over the past five months ""could easily translate into half a percent of gdp."" he said: ""it's not the biggest problem on the horizon compared to the collapse of housing prices, the crisis in productivity or the never-ending credit crunch. but it's not helpful."" he added that losing half a point of growth could be enough to throw the weakened economy into ***recession**.higher oil prices not only slow growth but also add to inflation, raising the specter of stagflation like that of the 1970s.""energy price increases, especially now that energy once again is becoming an ever-larger part of consumer spending and business costs, are both ***recession**ary and inflationary,"" said allen sinai, chief global economist at decision economics. and that, he said, makes higher oil prices ""a very bad kind of tax increase. they add to costs and can be part of an upward spiral of price inflation, which possibly feeds back into wage inflation and more price inflation.""all that makes it more difficult for federal reserve chairman ben s. bernanke to fight inflation and an ***economic slowdown** at the same time. ""when energy prices are rising enough to hurt the economy and add to inflation, the central bank is conflicted,"" sinai said.some of the damaging effects of oil prices are showing up in company earnings. on wednesday, alcoa reported that it was being squeezed by slumping demand for aluminum in north america and higher freight and energy costs. the company said 40 percent of its cost increases in the fourth quarter were energy-related.only a few months ago, many economists marveled at the relative absence of ill effects from high oil prices, which tripled from late 2001 through late 2006. in a paper titled ""who's afraid of a big bad oil shock?"" published in september, nordhaus wrote that ""the economy weathered an increase in real oil prices . . . without any major strain."" he credited fed officials, who focus on an inflation index that excludes oil and food prices. that prevented them from unnecessarily reining in growth. and he said economic ""tailwinds"" compensated for oil prices.since nordhaus wrote that, oil prices have increased 50 percent more and, as in the 1970s when the economy was rocked by two oil price shocks, other problems are also hurting growth. the united states also imports about 50 percent more oil than it did in 1979.in his paper last year, nordhaus noted that high crude oil prices had only half the expected impact on wages and the prices of other goods. the reason, he speculated, was that americans, who have seen big swings in oil prices since the 1970s, viewed the latest increases as fleeting. now, however, they may have decided that high oil prices are here to stay.perhaps as a result, oil price increases may be washing through the economy, not only affecting retail gasoline prices but also airline tickets, packaging and delivery services. the thirst for motor fuel, mandates by congress and a push to reduce dependence on oil imports have led to an increase in demand for corn-based ethanol, boosting food prices.in an interview this week, nordhaus said, ""it may be that some of the reason for price acceleration over the past year or so is that some of these [energy] price increases had been coming out of profits of airlines and places like that, and they may now be getting passed along.""bernanke was a young professor when the fed wrestled with oil shocks and stagflation in the late '70s. in a feb. 20, 2004, speech, he said the late-'70s oil-price spikes alarmed the fed more than the recent ones have. ""in a low-inflation environment, with stable inflation expectations and a general perception that firms do not have pricing power, commodity price shocks are not passed into final goods prices to nearly the same degree as in a looser monetary environment,"" bernanke said.in another speech that year, he warned that an inflation-averse central banker seeking to enhance his credibility and deliver low inflation could ""react too aggressively (from society's point of view) to contain the inflationary impact of the shock.""yesterday, however, he sounded more worried. ""the same increase in oil prices that may be a negative influence on growth is also lifting overall consumer prices and probably putting some upward pressure on core inflation measures as well,"" he said. ""any tendency of inflation expectations to become unmoored or for the fed's inflation-fighting credibility to be eroded could greatly complicate the task of sustaining price stability and reduce the central bank's policy flexibility to counter shortfalls in growth.""sinai blames u.s. policymakers for not reducing energy consumption. ""the lack of will of the united states, in a forward-looking way, to confront energy -- how much we use and how much it costs and what it might do to our economy -- is a horrible blot on the policy record of the united states,"" he said.

""it's going to highly paid production workers.""at bank of new york mellon, for example, none of the company's top five executives was paid a bonus. but the bank still paid 74 of its worker bonuses of at least $1 million each. senior executives at wells fargo &amp; co. - which lost $43 billion last year - also did not pocket bonuses, even as the firm paid bonuses of at least $1 million to 62 of its employees.the biggest bonus pool was paid out by j.p. morgan chase &amp; co., where $8.7 billion was distributed, a sum far larger than the $5.6 billion in earnings the bank reported. more than 1,600 morgan chase employees took home bonuses of $1 million or more.johnson said many of the traders and salesmen receiving big bonuses count on the checks for 75 percent of their yearly pay. those employees have long been paid for individual performance - how many bonds a bond salesman sold and how much money those deals generated for the company - rather than on the overall results that are supposed to be used to set pay for executives.banks have continued to pay even as some lost money, fearful a rival will woo their highest producers away.""for wall street banks, their main assets are their people,"" said broc romanek, editor of compensationstandards.com, a web site providing advice to corporate boards. ""the ones that are performing year to year, they don't want to lose them.""but the ***recession** and large losses at many of the banks paying big bonuses has exposed the weaknesses of the system.banks distribute bonuses far down the corporate ladder, but the payments are much smaller for rank-and-file employees.overall, the banks are on track to pay out more than they did before the ***recession** began. if current patterns hold, the biggest banks will pay their workers $156 billion in 2009, compared to the $143 billion paid in 2006, adjusted for inflation, said lucian bebchuk, a harvard university professor and leading expert on corporate pay.""the good days of compensation are back,"" bebchuk said friday.",8/1/09,0,1,0,,,1

""it is just impossible to predict with any degree of accuracy what will happen that far out,"" said steve agee, an economist with oklahoma city university who is executive director of the economic research and policy institute there. there are predictions in the report, however, which would be good for oklahoma's natural gas producers if they pan out, he added. in particular, agee focused on a projected growth of 23 percent in natural gas production during the next two decades, and a more than 40 percent increase in production of natural gas from unconventional shale fields. ""but the price of natural gas is going to have to get to and stay at a high enough level to induce these producers to go out and continue to drill wells,"" agee said. ""how fast we rebound from this ***recession** will have a large impact on whether or not what this report shows will happen. the government's predictions probably are a good guess, based on what we know right now. but it is so far out, it is hard to tell.""oil use to be steady the eia projects ""virtually no growth"" in u.s. oil consumption during the next 20-plus years.  it attributes its forecast to a combined effect caused by increasing mileage requirements for vehicles, increasing requirements to use biofuels and a rebound in oil prices when the world's economy recovers. the agency said it expects domestic consumption of oil to increase only 1 million barrels a day between now and 2030. it also expects the net import share of total liquids supplied, including biofuels, to decline from 58 percent in 2007 to less than 40 percent in 2025 before increasing to 41 percent in 2030.imports may decrease the energy information administration believes more natural gas will be used during the next two decades for power generation. but because of an increasing availability of the fuel domestically, it sees reduced imports for natural gas during the same time. officials expect the annual total domestic production of natural gas will reach 23.7 trillion cubic feet by 2030. while exploration and production costs will rise during that time, expected higher natural gas prices will support the growth. the agency expects annual onshore production of unconventional natural gas from shale fields will jump from 9.2 trillion cubic feet produced in 2007 to 13.2 trillion cubic feet in 2030. in 2007, the nation imported about 16 percent of its natural gas. the agency expects that amount to decline to less than 3 percent by 2030.predictions energy use &amp;rarr;energy information administration officials expect coal, oil, and natural gas to be meeting 79 percent of the country's energy supply requirements in 2030, down from an 85 percent share in 2007. &amp;rarr;while growth for oil in the u.s. may be flat during the next two decades, demand will continue to grow worldwide. the agency projects a price of $189 a barrel by 2030. &amp;rarr;officials say renewable energy's use will grow about 3.3 percent annually during the next two decades because of the federal renewable fuel standard and renewable energy portfolio standards required by many states. &amp;rarr;also, officials see a significant decline in numbers of gas-guzzling vehicles on the road, with more hybrid vehicles taking their place.",12/18/08,0,0,1,,,0

7W54-G5Y0-Y9J0-Y4CB-00000-00.txt,"c(""jul. 14--tensions within the gloucester police department over the assignment of daily tasks and paid details, an underlying factor in several recent controversies and the basis for accusations of favoritism and retribution, are targeted in a new contract signed by the patrolmen's union and city yesterday.the new contract includes no wage increases and carves into generous provisions regarding details, but also codifies gloucester's unwritten policy against hiring civilian flaggers at work sites.union representatives gathered for the signing at city hall yesterday said their decision to accept an agreement without a pay hike was an acknowledgement of municipal finances during the ***recession**.\""the union understands the city's financial position,\"" said patrolman michael williams jr., a member of the gloucester police patrolmen's association.but in exchange for no raises and a few givebacks, the union got the city to agree to make daily police assignments for patrolmen based on seniority, instead of on the discretion of the police chief and his top lieutenants.details and other extra, after-shift or seasonal assignments are also now subject to rules aimed at preventing favoritism, while special assignments, investigations and detective work are exempt.in recent years, members of the union have complained that management has used plum assignments -- both detail and on-shift -- to reward favored officers and punish those out of favor.\""some assignments can now be made by seniority in order to eliminate the favoritism that has seeped into management practices over the years,\"" according to a prepared statement issued by the mayor's office.in addition, the city agreed to tear up several written complaints against officers issued by former chief john beaudette for alleged abuse of sick leave, and replace them with verbal reprimands.the last patrolmen's contract expired july 1, 2007 and this three-year deal covers the past two years and will run until june 30, 2010. it was ratified by a unanimous vote of the rank and file last wednesday night.mayor carolyn kirk hailed the deal for keeping wages flat during a period when the city budget is shrinking.but she acknowledged that, with little in the way of financial incentive to offer the union, issues such as civilian flaggers and the city's funding of education benefits provided in the quinn bill were off the table.\""we weren't able to tackle details and the quinn bill and get three years of zeroes,\"" kirk said. \""those two things will be the thrust of negotiations for the next contract going forward.\""with the governor and many communities in massachusetts exploring potential cost-savings through the use of civilian flaggers at detail sites, gloucester has yet to try the idea.kirk said yesterday that even though the current contract does not specify officers at details, because the city has used officers for so long, an attempt to do so would not likely survive a union challenge.the city has had to pick up $201,000 in payments to officers provided by the quinn bill -- which provides pay raises of between 10 and 25 percent for officers with college degrees -- since state lawmakers cut $45 million in state funding. the state had formerly paid 50 percent of quinn costs.the biggest union give-back in the contract cuts the eight-hour minimum for private security details in half. under the previous deal, officers would be paid for eight hours of work even if they worked a fraction of that.the new deal also allows retired officers to remain in the detail rotation after for one year after they leave active duty, a provision that has already been in place to encourage early retirements.it establishes a flat rate for details of $40 an hour, an increase of $2 for the previous low rate and $3 decrease for the high rate. it is expected to be cost-neutral.for kirk, the patrolmen's deal comes during a re-election year in which contentious negotiations with the firefighters union has lead to lawsuits from firefighters and criticism from city council.\""the patrolmen are leading by example,\"" kirk said. \""we knew what is at stake and this sets the bar for all other union negotiations.\""this winter, at the height of budget uncertainty, kirk suspended negotiations with all city unions and cut school funding just before the school committee was about to agree to raises for seven unions.talks with the patrolmen's union began again in may, around the same time beaudette retired and was replaced by interim chief michael lane.according to the union, negotiations began to progress once lane became involved and expressed a willingness to change the rules governing assignments, including the seniority provision.\""we really started to make progress when the chief sat down at the table,\"" said patrolman jeremiah nicastro.under beaudette, alleged retribution against union members led to infighting that culminated last november in controversy about threatening remarks from an off-duty lieutenant broadcast over an open microphone.williams jr. was suspended three days this year for providing a tape of the threat to a boston television station.\""negotiations can be difficult at times,\"" said patrolman john foote, a member of the union's executive board. \""given all of the bad blood i think this is a major accomplishment.\""patrick anderson can be reached at panderson@gloucestertimes.comkeys to the dealkey provisions of the new gloucester patrolmen's union contract.no wage

7VDC-F470-Y8TC-S23H-00000-00.txt,"correction appendedwashington --the federal government is about to undertake what the general services administration calls the largest public building project since construction of the pentagon during world war ii: consolidating the department of homeland security on the historic site of a former mental hospital.coming during a deep ***recession**, the $3.4 billion, 4.5-million-square-foot public works project is being hailed as a boon to the local economy. the development, on a hill overlooking the united states capitol and the washington monument, represents the federal government's first significant presence in the district of columbia's blighted neighborhoods east of the anacostia river.but the mammoth undertaking has also drawn sharp criticism from preservationists, who say it will be devastating to a certified national historic landmark, the now-shuttered st. elizabeths hospital, a pioneering mental institution. its residents over the years have included the poet and fascist propagandist ezra pound after world war ii and, more recently, john hinckley, who shot president ronald reagan in 1981.objections were also raised by the national park service and the united states department of the interior, which owns parkland through which an access road is to be carved.nevertheless, construction is to begin by sept. 30 on a new $341 million headquarters for the united states coast guard, the first homeland security agency scheduled to relocate to the 176-acre st. elizabeths ''west campus.'' that is expected to happen by the winter of 2013.the consolidation will not bring everyone in the department, which was created after the sept. 11 terrorist attacks, to the high plateau east of the anacostia river. some will remain at eight other locations in the washington area. but up to 14,000 of the region's 26,000 department of homeland security employees -- now scattered in 70 buildings at 40 different sites -- are expected to be on the site by 2016.''for d.h.s., it will bring together all the critical components of this new department, facilitating a prompt and effective response whenever disaster strikes, as well as creating a 'common culture' among the agencies that were consolidated,'' said tony costa, acting commissioner of public buildings for the general services administration, which owns and oversees all federal properties.''for the american taxpayer,'' mr. costa added, ''it will save more than $630 million over the next three decades, when compared to the alternative of housing these d.h.s. components in leased space.''years in the planning, the consolidation at st. elizabeths has been enthusiastically endorsed by homeland security secretary janet napolitano. the president's stimulus package included $650 million for the project. this is to cover construction of the coast guard headquarters and more than $200 million in infrastructure improvements like utilities, roads, demolition, security fences and landscaping.the consolidation has garnered strong support from local officials, who have been trying for decades to land a large federal presence east of the anacostia river, washington's poorest section. ''this project will catalyze development east of the anacostia river faster than almost any other project we have on the drawing board,'' said neil albert, deputy mayor for planning and economic development.the homeland security offices will mainly be on the 176-acre federally owned west campus of st. elizabeths, but the department and the g.s.a. have agreed to put a 750,000-square-foot office building on the 170-acre east campus, which is owned by the district of columbia. (john hinckley is now housed in a forensic psychiatric hospital on the east campus.) the campuses are adjoining, bisected by martin luther king jr. avenue, a public road.the city hopes the presence of the department of homeland security will ignite private mixed-used development on the rest of the east campus. it envisions that shops, restaurants and apartments will be added there.these kinds of developments would be welcomed by residents of the adjoining anacostia and congress heights neighborhoods, which also stand to benefit from thousands of construction jobs. in addition, minority contractors have been hired to stabilize the site and have been promised a major role in the project, which is expected to run until 2016.the hospital on this site was initially called the government hospital for the insane. established in 1852, it was part of the first generation of asylums created for the indigent insane, largely through the efforts of the social reformer dorothea dix. it was the first such federal institution, and it also served as a military hospital during the civil war. wounded soldiers who were not mentally ill grew weary of explaining in their letters home that they were not insane. thus, the name change to st. elizabeths, using the name given the land by a 17th-century owner.st. elizabeths grew during the latter part of the 19th century and early 20th century and at one time included a dairy and vegetable farm to supply the complex. the classic red-brick victorian buildings, now boarded up, still dominate the west campus and give it a ghost town feel. the original building, designed in gothic revival style by thomas u. walter, architect of the united states capitol dome, is to house the secretary of department of homeland security, along with the federal emergency management agency, by 2014.the g.s.a. promises to restore 52 of 62 historic structures. ''who else could put this kind of money into preserving this facility, other than the federal government?'' asked a d.h.s. spokesman, larry orluskie. ''you couldn't turn this over to a nonprofit organization and say, 'maintain st. elizabeths.' it would crumble for sure.''while most of st. elizabeths, which had 7,640 patients at its peak at the end of world war ii, was inaccessible to the public, people in the area recall visiting the point, a promontory at the edge of the plateau with panoramic views of the nation's capital and fourth of july fireworks. the g.s.a. says the public will still have some access to the overlook and to a civil war cemetery, in what will otherwise be a high-fence, high-security center.''if history is a guide, where the federal government comes, it's like the good housekeeping seal of approval,'' said eleanor holmes norton, the district's nonvoting delegate to congress. ''private business and other entities spring up precisely because of the federal presence. there's no doubt this will happen here, particularly with the large amount of federal employees coming.''the homeland security project, scaled down slightly to address criticisms, won approval in january from the national capital planning commission, a hybrid local-federal agency that must approve all federal projects in the capital region. the vote was 9 to 1, with the negative vote cast by peter may, associate regional director for the national park service, representing the interior department.mr. may said his department objected to ''the cumulative effect of all the development and its essential impact on the national historic landmark.''the strongest outside objections have come from the national trust for historic preservation, which issued a report in 2007 concluding that more than 2.5 million square feet of development would overwhelm the national historic landmark.correction: april 15, 2009, wednesdaythis article has been revised to reflect the following correction: an article on the square feet pages last wednesday about the planned consolidation of the department of homeland security on the site of st. elizabeths hospital, a historic mental institution in washington, misstated the surname of the acting commissioner of public buildings for the general services administration, which oversees federal properties. he is tony costa, not acosta.",4/8/09,1,0,0,,0,0

4TK8-6TK0-TW8F-G19D-00000-00.txt,"caught off guard by their banks' exposure to the global ***financial crisis**, european governments are considering redrawing the regulatory landscape. and with the ***financial crisis** challenging some of the fundamentals of anglo-american-dominated  capitalism, france's competing vision of a europe with greater economic coordination is gaining some momentum.   proposals that only a week ago might have looked outlandish are suddenly being taken more seriously.  as the united states senate moved toward a vote on a $700 billion rescue package for american banks, officials here began debating whether europe needed a similar, though smaller, fund of its own, though european leaders had dismissed initial calls for their own bailout by treasury secretary henry m. paulson jr.  in brussels, the european commission proposed rules wednesday aimed at toughening lender supervision, and approved the nationalization of the british lender bradford &amp; bingley in a record 24 hours, brushing aside fears that the rescue might distort competition.france, which currently holds the presidency of the european union, suggested going much further -- strengthening cross-border cooperation among regulators, unifying rules on bank deposit guarantees, altering accounting standards to no longer require banks to write-off losses immediately and possibly suspending government aid rules.  the ideas are expected to be discussed at a meeting planned for saturday in paris, to be led by nicolas sarkozy, the french president. late wednesday, though, the timing was still up in the air, since prime minister gordon brown of britain and jean-claude trichet, the president of the european central bank, had not yet confirmed whether they would attend.  while the major banks in europe, including deutsche bank, barclays and societe generale, appear to be weathering the financial storm fairly well, several others have been taken over through government-engineered consolidations or nationalizations. the stepped up pace of activity comes as yet another bank, the giant pan-european lender, unicredit of italy, came under pressure in the stock market.  unicredit declared wednesday that it was well capitalized but was being damaged by stock speculators after its shares were temporarily suspended from trading in milan.  talk of a european bailout fund of 300 billion euros ($420 billion) made waves late on wednesday, after christine lagarde, france's finance minister, acknowledged that some sort of fund would be discussed at the weekend meeting.  ''we are in agreement within the e.u. that we need to support the financial sector,'' ms. lagarde, who did not put a price tag on any such fund, told the german business daily handelsblatt in an interview to be published thursday. ''then the question arises: do we need a european rescue fund to save banks?''  mr. sarkozy's office and the finance ministry were quick to deny that the fund was a french idea, and the german finance ministry attacked the notion as unwarranted.   one european official suggested that the plan had been floated by the netherlands. jan peter balkenende, the prime minister of the netherlands, will  meet with mr. sarkozy in paris on thursday. the fund might take the form of a reserve set aside for emergencies by each country, with each setting aside the same percentage of gross domestic product.  another idea, which is being offered by the french, is the creation of a european regulator of banks and insurers, a ''european policeman,'' as jean-pierre jouyet, the french european affairs minister, called it wednesday. that would most likely mean a significant tightening of coordination among national regulators.  officials are also looking at ways to standardize  deposit insurance levels across europe to avoid limits being ratcheted up haphazardly from one country to another in response to seeming panics. ireland decided this week to provide unlimited protection for all deposits at six irish banks.france would also like to see changes to european accounting rules, which stipulate that banks and insurers have to mark down their assets in line with short-term movements in the market. changes to the ''mark to market'' rules are also being considered at the  securities and exchange commission.  while france waits for those wide-ranging reforms to be discussed, both paris and berlin are expected to call for a systematic suspension of rules that limit government assistance to national banks. in the current climate, they seek greater latitude to rescue stricken institutions. officials in britain said they were generally behind such a proposal.germany, meanwhile, is arguing that brussels should ease up in its enforcement of strict rules against subsidies.  such a step would have immediate relevance for the german bank westlb, as well as other german state-owned banks.  westlb won initial approval for a 5 billion euro ''risk shield'' financed by the german government, regional german governments and local savings banks, to avoid a fire sale of its mortgage-linked assets. but it still needs to complete a restructuring that will persuade neelie kroes, the european competition commissioner, that the bank -- after bailouts stretching back a decade -- is on sound footing.  ms. kroes sought to pre-empt calls to abandon government aid limits by speeding through authorization of the bradford &amp; bingley nationalization.  at the same time, she made an indirect criticism of the irish government, which, according to european officials, gave little notice before announcing its deposit guarantee for six irish banks. britain said it would increase its guarantee for depositors to $:50,000 ($88,700), from $:35,000.  ms. kroes warned governments to consult before taking actions, and invoked the great depression. ''when europe was confronted with a banking crisis in the 1930s, governments decided to go national, to retreat from the european markets and close their borders,'' she argued. ''i would like to plead to national governments today not to act unilaterally.''  but mr. trichet cautioned against precipitous actions. because  europe is not a ''fully-fledged federation,'' he said, a pan-european solution  was unlikely.  ''each country has to mobilize its own efforts,'' he told bloomberg television in remarks released wednesday. ''but of course there is a european spirit and that is the spirit of the single market.''britain is trying to steer the debate toward a  ''college'' of national regulators that would coordinate their decisions.  luigi guiso, professor of economics and finance at the european university institute, said that so far national governments had dealt reasonably effectively with the situation but that would be tested if there was a problem with a bank like unicredit, which operates in 22 countries, including italy and germany and in eastern europe.  in hopes of preventing the situation from worsening, the italian securities market regulator, consob, said wednesday that it had banned short sales, or bets on declines of banking and insurance stocks, following similar measures by british, american, german and french authorities.

'in the short term, there may even be some gains because of the strengthening dollar, but there will be few taking advantage of the situation because only some 25% of the local crop remains to be sold,' explained flávio turra, technical and economic director of the cooperatives organization of paraná (ocepar), an entity that represents 80 cooperatives responsible for 55% of the state's agricultural production. 'however, for a sector that exports $60us billion a year it is easy to see that the stronger dollar will bring some gains,' he added. in fact, the simple rise in quotations of the dollar could even bring a new surge in plans to plant for brazil's forthcoming summer crop because, according to sector calculations, the stronger greenback will increase farm sector income. for example, in mato grosso state, with the dollar at $1r.60, profitability for soybean farmers is 6% of gross sales revenues from the crop because of the logistics problems of the region in southwestern brazil. with the dollar at $1r.80, profitability jumps to 25% of gross revenues. in paraná state (with the ports nearby), the dollar at $1r.60 gives 40% profitability. at $1r.80, it jumps expressively to 59%. © 2008 noticiasfinancieras - gazeta mercantil - all rights reserved",9/23/08,1,1,1,,,1

""these are not just upper-end homes,"" dave anderton, board of realtors spokesman, told the deseret news. ""roughly 75 percent of the 1,401 short sales listed ? are prices below $300,000. only 7 percent are priced above $500,000."" in utah, 8.42 percent of homeowners with a mortgage are either delinquent or in foreclosure, anderton said. nationally, just over 12 percent of homeowners are behind in their payments, he added. rick bentley, sales manager and associate broker for coldwell banker residential brokerage, said another issue contributing to the rise in short sales is the faulty loan practices employed by lenders during the housing boom. ""you factor in the type of loans that were done ? the 100 percent financing, no income (verification) loans, the interest-only (adjustable rate mortgage) loans and job loss ? those numbers are extremely accurate as to where the shorts sales are coming from,"" he said. despite the challenges facing many utah homeowners, the situation is worse in other states. according to data complied by irvine, calif.-based online market research firm realtytrac inc., utah ranked fifth in the midyear 2009 u.s. foreclosure market report, with one in every 69 households registering a foreclosure filing, a rate increase of nearly 88 percent from the same period last year. the report showed that foreclosure filings ? default notices, auction sale notices and bank repossessions ? nationwide climbed 9.5 percent in the first six months of 2009 and jumped almost 15 percent from the first six months of last year. with that information in mind, zions bank chief economist jeff thredgold told the deseret news that it is not surprising to see the values of homes falling, which is contributing to the increase in short sales. ""as painful as that is, you look at las vegas, the number (of short sales) is one in three,"" he said.

""when you've got an economy in ***recession** ? you've got 6.5 million fewer workers than you had 18 months ago,"" he said. ""we have 46,000 fewer workers in utah than we had a year ago, so many of these people are selling because they have to."" the utah department of workforce services reported last week that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 5.7 percent in june, a 2.4 percentage point hike over the same month last year. the u.s. unemployment rate continued to rise, reaching 9.5 percent for june.

""a place like the mayflower simply wouldn't survive without repeat business because of a couple dynamics. one is that the majority of hotels in the jackson area are in north jackson. business travelers most likely are not going to drive into the downtown of a strange city for dinner. the roberts walthall is undergoing renovation, and there are plans on the drawing board for more hotel developments downtown, but for the most part, the hotel business is a few miles away.  ""restaurants up there see more of a transient group than we do,"" kountouris said. ""if you come to the mayflower, you come to a destination. you're not going to be going to a movie and just happen to pass by here. we're the destination. we're not a stepping stone. ""the core group of customers have kept coming through the ***recession**, kountouris said. there have been fringe effects of the downturn, but nothing that would threaten to close the place.""nothing major right now,"" kountouris said. ""that's about as exact as i can get. ""the restaurant business, at best, is unpredictable, especially in a ***recession**. it can make decisions like how much food to order to how many people to keep on staff a moving target.  the central business district in downtown has had its share of issues the past two decades, with businesses leaving. there are a lot of developers spending lots of money and time in an effort to reverse that trend.""you never know in this business,"" kountouris said.

4N3M-59B0-TWK1-C2YB-00000-00.txt,"for almost a century, many counties across the nation have received payments from the federal government as compensation for containing national forests. last year, 33 of oregon's 36 counties shared $220 million from the federal government under the program. lane county, ore., which contains eugene, ore., and the university of oregon campus, received $47 million.but the payments -- which served as the lifeblood for schools, roads, criminal justice and public health -- expired in september 2006, and unlike before, there is little sign from congress that they will be renewed again.this has left lane county -- and especially its criminal justice system -- scrambling to find a way to replenish its funding source or brace for massive cuts. the cuts could force the district attorney to choose which cases he is able to prosecute, leaving certain types of crimes virtually unpunishable in the county.for example, if the lane countydistrict attorney decides to cease prosecuting auto crimes, and subsequently a eugene police officer catches someone stealing a car red-handed, the only action the officer could take is to make the thief give the car back, and then let the criminal go scot-free, eugene police chief rob lehner said during the feb. 15 police commission meeting.if a funding solution is not found by around april 2007, hundreds of public safety and public health workers would be laid off, and cuts could even include 764 jail beds, leaving only 84 beds remaining for local offenders, according to a letter from lane county sheriff russel burger to the lane county board of commissioners. there are 92 offenders currently jailed for charges to the degree of rape, robbery, murder and kidnapping, according to the letter.""if the county loses the (federal payments), and this is not made up in some way, we as a community and a region are facing a public safety crisis we've never seen here,"" lehner said.burger recommended to the lane county board of commissioners that they enact a temporary tax to fill the void left by the lost revenue.how we got herewhen president theodore roosevelt began designating lands as national forests in the late 1800s, counties across the nation -- which were restricted from developing on the national forests in their counties -- lobbied congress to pass a law that required the federal government to share 25 percent of the revenue generated from timber harvests on those lands. until the late 1980s, this system worked, and enough money was paid to these counties that their taxes were lower than most others.the system worked so well that lane county, which is made up of nearly 55 percent of federal forest lands, earned a large enough portion of revenue from the law that its taxes were lower than most other counties in the state. in the early 1990s, voters in lane county passed a measure that put a cap on the amount of property taxes that could be increased each year, which essentially locked lane county into an artificially low tax rate, said lane county budget manager dave garnick.because tax inflation was unable to keep up with regular inflation of the cost of services, the county has been forced to make cuts to services each year to stay within its budget, according to a lane county frequently asked questions form.also during the time of the measure's passing, oregon was hit with a timber ***recession**. the ***recession** was fueled in part by the passage of more restrictive environmental laws to protect the forests and its wildlife, such as the spotted owl. gradually, those 25 percent payments were reduced dramatically, intergovernmental relations manager tony bieda said.because the timber industry hasn't fully recovered, counties in oregon went to congress in the late 1990s and said, ""wait a minute, you're killing us,"" bieda said.congress and then-president bill clinton responded, and enacted the secure rural schools and community self determination act of 2000, which provided dependent counties with a fixed annual payment that mirrored the amounts these counties were receiving during better years of logging. these payments translated into $220 million for oregon's dependent counties last year. of that money, $47 million went to lane county, which was then split up with $7 million going to schools, $20 million to roads and $20 million -- roughly one third -- to the general fund to pay for things like elections, the sheriff's and the district attorney's offices and public health programs.despite having the support of 22 senators and 62 representatives in congress, the act was not extended after it expired in 2006. the likelihood of it ever being extended seems unlikely, garnick said. part of the reason the act is unlikely to be renewed is because it affects only some states greatly, and others not as much. currently, 42 states receive money through srs, but oregon takes most of the share -- 54 percent of the national total.in anticipation for the eventual loss of the srs, lane county created ballot measure 20-114 in november 2006 that would have created an income tax intended to fill the gaping hole in the budget -- but the measure was defeated.also in anticipation for a loss in revenue, the lane county management team crafted a prioritization list of services, and drew a line at the position where cuts would begin: on line 28 on a list of 74 services.""i don't think any of the options (for cuts) are good ones,"" lehner said. ""we are very much at the brink.""bieda said that if lane county doesn't find a solution before april 2007, it will begin issuing pink slips to about 250 public safety and public health workers.(c) 2007 oregon daily emerald via u-wire",2/20/07,0,0,1,,,0

4N6F-6FV0-TW87-N2NF-00000-00.txt," when i write about the stock market, i usually tell you to ignore the short-term noise and concentrate on the long-term picture. today, however, i'd like to depart from form and talk with you about what we can learn from the past week's sharp declines in worldwide stock prices.  let's start with $3.1 trillion. that's how much the market value of the world's stocks has dropped in the five trading days that ended yesterday, according to the folks at wilshire associates. wilshire says $1 trillion of the loss comes from the drop in the u.s. market; the rest is from declines in the world's other markets. it works out to a drop of 6.6 percent, which is an awful lot for one trading week. and although owners of u.s. stocks have been whacked with a 5.5 percent decline, they're doing well compared with the rest of the world, which is down 7.4 percent.  the good news, of sorts, is that despite the $3 trillion-plus drop, the world's stocks were still worth about $44 trillion when the u.s. market closed yesterday  --  though by the time you read this, who knows?  one of the temptations of journalists  --  and supposed market experts  --  is to produce a valid-sounding, logical explanation for why all these markets have dropped. a number of reasons have been offered as to why these markets have dropped so far so fast: inflation; global ***economic slowdown**s; fallout from the implosion of part of the u.s. mortgage market. but i have a more jaded  --  and i would say more realistic  --  view of things.   i think stocks are going down because they're going down, and that selling has begotten selling. last year, so many stocks in so many markets went up so sharply because they were going up, and buying begat buying. as they say on wall street, ""the trend is your friend."" except when it's your enemy.   although i can't prove it, i think one reason why the markets are tanking en masse is that hedge funds are dumping stocks and commodities and currencies out of a combination of need and fear. other hot-money trading shops  --  i won't call them investors, i'll call them speculators  --  are doing the same thing. these folks, in various parts of the world, aren't sitting around soberly contemplating the future economies of the united states, japan or china. they're selling what they can.  this is the opposite of last year, when markets all over the world were rising, seemingly in lock step. if you didn't borrow heavily to buy stocks last year, you looked like a chump. now, with markets dropping, having a lot of borrowed money is dangerous, and the players are bailing out.  the most obvious example is what is known as the carry trade, which involves the japanese yen. for several years, you could borrow yen short-term for effective interest rates of about zero and invest in things like u.s. dollar securities that carried substantially higher interest rates. as a bonus, the yen was declining relative to the dollar, so you not only borrowed cheap and lent dear, you made a few bucks on the currency movements, too.  but not in the past five days, with the yen having risen more than 4 percent against the dollar. suddenly, people who did the no-brainer yen-carry transactions are having their brains beaten in. now, they're now scrambling to buy yen and sell dollars to unwind the trade. this pushes the yen's value up relative to the dollar. these currency moves have little or nothing to do with economic fundamentals; they're about trading.  you can see the results of the yen's appreciation in one stock: toyota. toyota shares trading on the tokyo stock exchange have fallen 10.6 percent in yen the past five days, but toyota shares trading on the new york stock exchange in dollars are down only 6.7 percent.   and now, a final irony. just when you think you know what the market is doing, it turns around and does the opposite. it was on feb. 20 that the u.s. market  --  as represented by the dow jones wilshire 5000 index  --  finally broke through the high that it set during the stock bubble in 2000. (the 30 dow industrial stocks had set more than 30 highs since october  --  but although the dow has huge mindshare, it's not the stock market.) since setting its one and only high, the wilshire has fallen more than 6 percent. go figure.   sloan is newsweek's wall street editor. his e-mail is sloan@panix.com",3/6/07,1,1,1,,,1

4SSW-1SS0-TW8F-G0T3-00000-00.txt,"as the price of gasoline quadrupled over the last decade, american drivers seemed to defy the laws of economics by pumping more  into their vehicles year after year.   but this is the year american drivers appear to be finally succumbing to price shock at the pump, according to a new report by cambridge energy research associates, a consulting firm affiliated with ihs inc. it says the slowdown in the economy and soaring gasoline prices have finally persuaded americans to drive fewer miles in fewer gas-guzzling vehicles.  ''u.s. gasoline demand will likely decline in 2008 for the first time in more than 17 years,'' says the report to be released thursday. ''for the first time since the 1970s and early 1980s the number of miles driven by americans has clearly begun trending downward.''  the transportation department reported on wednesday that americans drove 1.8 percent fewer miles on public roads in april 2008 compared with the same month last year, the sixth  consecutive month of driving mileage declines.   the cambridge energy report cites some fundamental shifts in consumer behavior that suggest the beginning of an enduring trend. the report noted that in california, where gasoline prices have historically led the rest of the country, gasoline consumption has declined for two consecutive years and hybrid vehicle sales are rising.  now the rest of the country seems to be following. sales of pickup trucks, minivans and sport utility vehicles have fallen below 50 percent of new passenger vehicle sales this year for the first time since 2001, the report says, as consumers turned to smaller vehicles  in favor of fuel economy.  ''it's kind of stunning,'' said aaron f. brady, a co-author of the report. ''it was over 50 percent as late as february and by may it fell under 44 percent. it's like falling off a cliff.''  drivers, meanwhile, are becoming more prudent in their driving habits, either by using public transportation, carpooling or just cutting down on unnecessary trips, the two authors said in an interview. ''public transit ridership is surging all over the country,'' said samantha gross, the other  author.   while total vehicle miles americans traveled grew by nearly 3 percent a year from 1984 to 2004, the rate of growth slowed suddenly in 2005 and 2006 and has declined since then.   the last time gasoline consumption declined for a prolonged period was during the oil shocks in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when annual united states consumption declined by 12 percent. fast-rising  oil prices, a deep ***recession** and improved fuel efficiency standards drove down demand for gasoline.   the same situation is beginning to emerge today, according to the report, and basic home economics explains the trends. since the 1980s, demand for gasoline has climbed fairly steadily, except in late 1990 and 1991 because of a sharp price increase related to iraq's invasion of kuwait and a ***recession**. that is because spending on gasoline became a smaller percentage of family income, especially through the 1990s.  americans spent about 4.5 percent of their after-tax income on transportation fuels in 1981, according to global insight, a forecasting firm. as gasoline prices dropped and family incomes rose, that percentage dropped to 1.9 percent in 1998. today, it is back to 4 percent or more.   the national price for unleaded gasoline would need to average $4.23 a gallon ''to create the same economic pain as in 1981,'' the cambridge energy report said. ''once unthinkable, such a level is now within view.'' on wednesday, gasoline averaged nearly $4.08 a gallon.  it would take a sizable decline in consumption to get back to the levels of gasoline use only a generation ago.  national gasoline consumption has grown over the last 25 years by 40 percent because of the growing popularity of sport utility vehicles and minivans as well as longer commutes to work from the suburbs. low gasoline prices made the growth relatively painless, until the last three years or so.  the cambridge energy report said gasoline demand growth slowed significantly from 2005 to 2007 and peaked last year. demand in the first quarter of 2008 declined by 1.3 percent from the first quarter in 2007.  even if consumers start driving more, the report predicts that the efficiency of the american vehicle fleet will continue to improve. ''new fuel efficiency standards for light vehicles (scheduled to phase in starting in 2011) by themselves have the potential to begin reducing u.s. gasoline demand within the next decade,'' the report said.  if gasoline prices remain high, motorists may well ''accelerate their preference shift toward more fuel-efficient vehicles,'' the report concluded. ''if these trends hold, then 2007 could stand as the peak year for u.s. gasoline demand.''  the authors said they thought gasoline consumption would continue to ease even if gasoline prices went down, unlike in the 1980s and 1990s when consumption sprang back up as prices went down.  ''with climate change concerns now, it's very likely that fuel efficiency will be at the forefront for the foreseeable future,'' said ms. gross, ''and it's unlikely we will go back to not caring about fuel efficiency the way we did in the late 1980s.''

7X4D-V1Y1-2R2Y-7120-00000-00.txt,"c(""nov. 19--california once again will look under sofa cushions and scour every sector of state government to find another $20.7 billion to balance its budget over the next 19 months.this time, however, state leaders won't be able to reap savings from some of the state's largest spending categories.california can't touch most funding for k-12 schools or colleges because the state already is spending close to a minimum amount required by the federal government. the state can't cut medi-cal until january 2011 for the same reason. those programs make up more than half the state's $84.6 billion general fund budget.\""we cannot reduce those areas very much more, so that closes off a very big piece of your budget,\"" said nonpartisan legislative analyst mac taylor, who released his $20.7 billion deficit projection wednesday.the news brings relief to education groups, but it puts more pressure on other programs that lack federal spending requirements. state leaders likely will pursue additional cuts in prisons, state parks and social service programs not associated with federal spending requirements or matching funds.the legislative analyst's report assumes that three-a-month state worker furloughs would end in june. but gov. arnold schwarzenegger could seek to extend them further, pending the outcome of court challenges.another target could be healthy families, the low-cost children's health insurance program. schwarzenegger once proposed eliminating healthy families and did cut its funding this summer, although he and lawmakers restored coverage for 600,000 low- and middle-income children in september.\""i think we've exhausted cuts that don't shock the conscience,\"" said anthony wright, executive director of health access california. \""we need to look to other solutions, including raising taxes and revenues, because the cuts that are left are unforgivable, including denying children coverage.\""california faces a new shortfall in part because lawmakers and schwarzenegger relied on several risky solutions in budget agreements earlier this year.they include a $1 billion partial sale of the state compensation insurance fund, now under legal challenge by insurance commissioner steve poizner. they also include $800 million in transit money that courts said the state could not use for general purposes.the $20.7 billion gap could grow even larger if courts toss out a $1.7 billion shift of redevelopment funds that faces review, or deem furloughs illegal.another reason for the looming deficit is that lawmakers relied on one-time savings, such as delaying state worker paychecks by one day from june 30 to july 1. state leaders likely will search for similar solutions to help solve the next gap.taylor recommended wednesday that state lawmakers move quickly and consider not only cuts but any possible revenue sources. he specifically warned against increasing tax rates, which could further stress the economy.taylor suggested the state could consider ending certain tax breaks for businesses by mandating that all multi-state firms use the same method to calculate their california taxes or eliminating enterprise zones, which provide tax credits to employers in specified areas. he said benefits of the latter program are questionable.but michael shaw, california legislative director with the national federation of independent business, said curtailing business incentives would hurt the state's economic recovery.\""additional tax increases are going to take more money out of californians and small business owners in particular,\"" he said. \""at best it would prolong our economic ***recession** and at worst lead to longer-term job losses.\""democrats are likely to revisit ideas from last year, such as a tax on oil production in california. schwarzenegger again may seek to allow oil drilling off the coast of santa barbara in exchange for royalties.but after signing several temporary tax hikes in february, the governor said wednesday in milan, italy, that he doesn't want to consider any new tax increases, according to dow jones newswires.\""i think it's important not to raise revenues, not to raise taxes,\"" he said. \""we have to live within our means.\""taylor recommended that the state lobby for a new round of federal relief to help plug its budget hole.he also suggested lawmakers could return to the ballot to take tax money dedicated now for mental health services, first five early childhood development and after-school programs.voters rejected measures in may that would have taken money from the first two.to see more of the sacramento bee, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.sacbee.com. copyright (c) 2009, the sacramento bee,

""now that time has come,"" reid said, adding he is ""willing and ready to help my republican colleagues keep their word"" by looking for bipartisan solutions to iraq. the first order of senate business will be a vote on former rep. jim nussle, r-iowa, to take over as white house budget director. nussle's nomination has been caught up in democratic anger over the president's threat to veto most of the spending bills congress is advancing for the new fiscal year starting oct. 1. bush claims they spend too much. the house has passed its appropriations bills but the senate has completed only one. up first in the senate are budgets for veterans, foreign aid and transportation programs. the house financial services committee will hold a hearing wednesday on the subprime ***mortgage crisis** and options for preventing a flood of homeowner foreclosures. sen. charles schumer, d-n.y., said he was heartened by bush's support last friday for several democratic-backed steps to help homeowners. since bush adviser karl rove left and attorney general alberto gonzales announced his resignation, ""many of us have been wondering, is the president about to change course, to move to the middle of the road, to work with democrats,"" schumer said. ""this is the first really concrete action we have seen where the president is indeed moving to the middle."" still, there are many issues to fight about. democrats have been criticized by many of their supporters for letting bush push them last month into temporarily expanding the government's ability to eavesdrop on suspected terrorists without warrants. that authority expires in six months. when it comes up for renewal, democrats want to narrow the circumstances in which spy agencies can skip getting warrants from a special court. house and senate negotiators also hope to develop a final version of legislation that would add millions of children to a popular health insurance program. the white house threatened to veto both chambers' bills, which include big tax increases on tobacco products to pay for spending increases the white house says are unacceptable. house-senate negotiations will also resume on proposals to improve drug safety, reduce college costs and make the country more energy independent. a senate bill, facing a veto threat, calls for a 40 percent increase in average auto mileage to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. the house version doesn't address automobile fuel economy, but would require electric utilities to produce at least 15 percent of their power from renewable energy sources, an idea left out of the senate version. house hearings are also scheduled on the utah mine disaster and the minnesota bridge collapse. the senate will look slightly different in september. south dakota democratic sen. tim johnson will be back at work nine months after suffering a life-threatening brain hemorrhage.

4VGV-R5W0-TX2J-416H-00000-00.txt,"georgia's public schools stand to receive more than $1 billion in additional federal money for construction and to help students with disabilities and those who come from poor families.the money is part of the mammoth two-year stimulus bill pushed by president barack obama that the house approved wednesday. the senate is expected to debate the economic recovery plan next week.if the bill becomes law, ""this will probably be the best education funding news we have had from an american president or congress in 25 years,"" said frank petruzielo, superintendent of cherokee county schools. ""these are the kids in our schools who need the most help, and this is the first step i've seen by the federal government to really level the playing field.""while many educators applaud the extra money, some republicans have complained the bill won't do enough to create and save jobs and doesn't include enough tax cuts.school leaders in atlanta have long argued the federal government shirks its responsibility to provide enough money to teach special education students and low-income children. the lack of federal money placed a heavier burden on the state and local school districts --- both of which are struggling during the ***recession**.georgia schools could expect an extra $721 million total for this year and next for special education programs and title i programs to help poor children learn. for many atlanta area districts, this represents a 40 percent to 55 percent increase in federal funding. schools have used title i money to hire and train additional teachers, purchase extra books and other materials, provide tutoring after hours and hold seminars to show parents how they can help their kids with schoolwork.educators were particularly excited over the increase in money for special education students, who have disabilities that can cost schools tens of thousands of dollars to accommodate. federal law requires schools to provide programs to meet the needs of special education students regardless of cost or staffing difficulties.when the individuals with disabilities education act was enacted in 1975, it said the federal government eventually would provide 40 percent of the funding to teach special education students. the actual federal allotment typically falls between 12 percent and 19 percent a year.louise radloff, a gwinnett county school board member since 1973, has waited decades for an increase in special education money. about one of every nine gwinnett students receives a special education service.""if the federal government mandates us to do something, they need to give us the money to make it happen,"" radloff said. ""every year, we're getting more kids to help, and they have more problems. we need this extra money to work with them.""one advocate cautioned that the $1.17 billion stimulus money --- which includes $446 million in construction funds --- is a short-term fix. susan walker, policy director for the georgia partnership for excellence in education, said schools still need to address long-term concerns about money and spending.the amount of money each state would receive was determined using a complex formula that takes into account how many students come from low-income homes.georgia would receive $497 per student in 2009 and rank no. 28, according to an analysis conducted by new america foundation, a nonpartisan research group. georgia has about 1.6 million public schools students.georgia's money includes about $446 million to renovate and modernize schools. this one-time allocation marks the first time the federal government would provide money for school construction.federal officials have said this provision would create thousands of construction jobs because many schools buildings need repair.many districts in the atlanta area use revenue from special purpose local option sales tax (splost) to pay for construction. voters approve this temporary penny-per-dollar sales tax, but revenues are down because of the weak economy.school districts leaders said it's too soon to say exactly how they will spend the money. petruzielo appointed a committee to review the district's needs in construction, title i and special education and come up with recommendations.chuck burbridge, chief financial officer for atlanta schools, said the district would prioritize projects it can't currently afford so the system can move quickly should the money arrive. still, he said it was premature to assume the bill would pass.some school leaders are fighting to make sure they get the money. radloff said gwinnett officials keep in close contact with congressional leaders, such as sen. johnny isakson (r-ga.).""of course we're continually lobbying,"" radloff said.

""that's one of the reasons we're adjusting the menu here. we have to make blossom more affordable.""blossom deli has been a popular charleston eatery almost since the day sohovich introduced his menu in the historic art deco soda shop in 1994. to accommodate the effects of the ***economic downturn**, the unflappable sohovich added items in the $10 to $15 range to the menu.he took his inspiration from classic new orleans dishes that did well at billy's. he and executive sous chef jeremy proud perfected their versions of red beans and rice, chicken gumbo, jambalaya (a spicy lowland stew with sausage, chicken, celery, onions and tomatoes) and etouffee, (a fresh seafood in a savory rich sauce). allfour dishes are served over rice.""we've had people from new orleans come in and say this the best they've had outside of new orleans,"" proud said.the etouffee sells especially well, said proud as he dished up a tantalizing mix of grouper, shrimp, scallops, mussels, crayfish, salmon and tuna in a mouthwatering sauce over rice. ""i was a little skeptical when we first talked about it, but it's going well,"" proud said about the menu changes.also new on the dinner menu are prime rib and a 10-ounce sirloin steak. sohovich roasts the prime rib on the bone daily and offers a small or regular cut. the sirloin, a less expensive cut than the new york strip steak that previously held a spot on the menu, is marinated with rosemary and garlic and served over a portobello mushroom cap.he had no trouble adding items to his menu, but struggled with what to remove. although they were popular, trout almondine, rack of lamb, scallops rockefeller and duck breast are gone. some high-end entrees remain like the grouper en vinaigrette ($27), thai shrimp &amp; beef ($23), veal scallopini ($27) and horseradish crusted yellowfin tuna ($28).""the grouper and the thai shrimp and beef just have to stay. people expect them,"" he said.

7W3V-6CW0-Y9NW-601F-00000-00.txt,"the faculty workplace has changed significantly in the last 20 years: more women, minority professors, and adjuncts have joined the professoriate. information technology has led to new opportunities and expectations. the ***economic crisis** has complicated long-term planning for scholars and institutions alike. we asked seven scholars from several fields and generations how they think the academic workplace -- and, in particular, the job satisfaction and expectations of a faculty career -- will change over the next 20 years.marc bousquetassociate professor of cultural studies and writing with new media at santa clara university, and author of how the university works: higher education and the low-wage nation (new york university press, 2008)look at the tenured colleagues to your left and right. imagine them gone.at the present rate of decline, the next two decades will see the percentage of tenured and tenure-track professors plunge into the single digits. as of the fall of 2007, the tenurable comprised just one-quarter of the faculty population, according to the american federation of teachers, down from one-third a decade earlier.sadly, the aft analysis is probably conservative.nor do these sobering statistics capture the full sense of the transformation. tasks formerly performed by the professoriate haven't just been turned over to lecturers -- much of that work is now done by an army of nonfaculty staff members, administrators, and even undergraduate students.in short, we already know what the future academic workplace will look like. it will closely resemble many of today's for-profits and the community colleges with which they compete -- operating without tenure or with tenure reserved for a small group of faculty administrators in charge of hiring, supervising, and setting curriculum for a part-time staff, whose members typically lack doctorates and earn only a few thousand dollars.at institutions where some faculty members now engage in research, tenure is likely to survive among those who bring in external grants. but departments that traditionally rely on internal financing are likely to do steadily less research and more instruction. this development is at least partly the result of the faculty members' having acquiesced to the improper idea that tenure is a kind of ""merit badge"" for those with research-intensive workloads, imagining instruction as an inferior pursuit, suitable only for nontenurable appointment. many of these departments may consolidate on the model of the community college -- more and more ""modern language departments"" and ""humanities departments.""in many cases, the income-producing research activity will follow the trend of moving into nondepartmental locations -- institutes, centers, and programs -- that can be closed with less fuss if the income dries up.this suggests an alternate to consolidating departments at institutions where faculty members do research: by redefining the department chiefly as an instructional center and not the home of exciting interdisciplinary research, the researchers will visit departments only to irritably develop syllabi to be implemented by subordinated cadres of cheap teachers, and to reproduce themselves in steadily more pro forma votes, as the real decisions about hiring and retention are made in the revenue centers.these pattens of change are affecting all of us, just not in exactly the same way or at the same pace. nonetheless it has to be said: for the majority of us, this ugly future has already happened. the only reason ""we"" don't realize it is because those of us with the loudest professional voices haven't allowed ourselves to understand.what the one-quarter of us bemoaning the ""future"" demise of tenure are most unwilling to understand is this: those of us with tenure are not just a minority -- we're experiencing a radical shift in our function with respect to everyone else. with the nontenurable majority engaged primarily in teaching, and many of the tenured released to revenue production, the remaining fraction of a fraction performs most of the service for everyone else.more and more committee work. longer terms in administration. more advising of more complex requirements, and more assessment of more kinds of learning. more mentoring of graduate students. more oversight of student workers, including undergraduates. and a steady stream of more and more nakedly managerial responsibilities with respect to the nontenurable majority -- hiring, evaluation, curricular development, professional development, and so on.if you are tenured and feel this intensified service burden already, imagine what it will be like 20 years from now when the proportion of tenured and tenure track is 8 percent, not 25 percent.fortunately, there are countertrends. most notably, the movement toward unionization of the nontenurable faculty is producing substantial new forms of job security and raising wages. and there is a growing willingness to reconsider the bad idea that tenure is a merit badge for research scholars. there is a growing acknowledgment that faculty members with teaching-intensive responsibilities are needed everywhere (even at research institutions), and that the best form of stabilizing their employment is the intensive peer scrutiny of the tenure system, not the lax and superficial metrics of administrator supervision.timothy carmodypostdoctoral fellow at the university of pennsylvania, where he teaches first-year writing and writes about literary modernism and the history and theory of media; turns 50 in 2029how is academe different in 2029? let's begin with the basics: reading, writing, and teaching. if anything, google is even more important. the 2009 author/publisher settlements that allowed google to sell full access to its book collections didn't revolutionize books in retail, but subscription sales to institutions did fundamentally alter the way libraries think about their digital and analog collections. access to comprehensive digital libraries allows teachers at any institution to compile virtual syllabi on the fly, seamlessly integrating readings, assignments, communication, and composition.automated subscriptions powered by google's search services deliver articles on any topic or keyword of interest instantaneously; hyperlinked citations and references appear with the original document, as threads in a continuing conversation, creating the first genuinely hypertext documents.apple's popular iread application (launched in 2011) enables reading, writing, and recording on virtually any device. some teachers and students still use laptops or tablets, but others prefer handhelds, like phones or game consoles. but users' inherited assumptions about the casual use of these devices make both teaching and research more closely resemble the activity of online social networks than traditional lectures, seminars, or conferences. courses typically emphasize collaborative research leading to immediate publication of short bursts of text. reader feedback then powers incremental improvements and additions.the curriculum, especially in the humanities, valorizes thoughtful curation and recirculation of material rather than comprehension or originality. the traditional unidirectional model of knowledge transmission (best represented by the now-deprecated ""lecture"") has been effectively discredited, although it persists through habit, inertia, and whispered doubts about the efficacy and rigidity of the new model. many professors periodically pause to lecture, but only apologetically, or when distanced by ironic quotation marks.the 'teens are as widely remembered for technical innovation and radical dissemination of knowledge as the '20s are for job loss, technological retrenchment, and economic concentration. in 2019, when google used its capital to snap up the course-management giant blackboard and the ebsco, lexisnexis, and ovid databases, it effectively became the universal front end for research and teaching in the academy.many university presses were shuttered in the transition from print to digital, especially those affiliated with public universities looking to shed costs following the catastrophic collapse of the university of california system following state budget cuts in 2020. the remaining presses make up for lost textbook sales by hosting blogs where established scholars and high-octane amateurs brush shoulders (and compete for shared advertisement revenue). these in turn drive production of traditional monographs, whether published electronically, in print, or both. scholars also directly market their services as virtual lecturers to students and other institutions. all authors now have a broader view of their audience, across institutions, disciplines, and peer levels.everyone is excited, but everything is uncertain. no one knows what will happen next. just like 20 years ago. ...anthony t. graftonprofessor of european history at princeton universitytwenty years on, the humanities workplace will look and be worse. in recent decades, competition for stars in the top tier of research universities -- a competition that became especially fierce early in the current decade -- has resulted in high salaries and low workloads for a fortunate few. meanwhile, conditions for most humanists have deteriorated. even in prosperous times, many administrations have treated the faculty chiefly as a cost center. they have minimized the expense of instruction by replacing long-term and permanent appointments with graduate assistantships and short-term jobs. a majority of faculty members now work outside the tenure system.unless the world economy recovers with startling speed, for the next several years university administrators, even at top universities, will be even more sensitive than they have been to financial pressures -- far more than to demands for prestige or departmental pleas that they heap riches on a deep thinker because some other university proposes to do so.even high fliers will see salaries frozen and perks withdrawn. more important, few new tenured and tenure-track appointments will be on offer. when funds become available again, postdoctoral fellowships and other terminal positions will multiply more rapidly than traditional jobs, since awarding them does not require administrations to commit funds for the long term. even at the top of the system, the workplace will be less stable, less prosperous, and less humane. for most humanists, insecurity will become the new norm.innovation will continue to take place, and scholars with new skill sets will still enter the humanistic academy. the natural locus for these changes may be interdisciplinary centers, most of them responsible for raising their own support from outside grants. this model has begun to spread from the natural and social sciences into the humanities -- for example, in the shape of digital-humanities centers. flexible incubators of this kind will help bring new forms of scholarship and teaching into being. at their best, these enterprises will bring humanists and scientists together, replacing some of the loneliness and freedom of traditional humanistic scholarship with collaborative modes of work. unlike traditional monographs and articles, their results will reach wide publics around the nation and the world.these changes, however, will exact costs of their own, diverting investment from traditional scholarly institutions, such as established disciplines, research libraries, and university presses. the new centers are likely to provide more contingent than permanent positions. most of their inhabitants will have to be ""entrepreneurial"" (and scramble for money) if they hope for continued employment. and the stable support for learning that is needed to train students in the traditional practices of the humanities -- whether the classics they love are greek or chinese, arabic or sanskrit, by men or by women -- will be even harder to find than it is now. still, such centers are likely to be the main bright spots in a darkening sky.joseph c. hermanowiczassociate professor of sociology at the university of georgia; studies careers and is the author of lives in science: how institutions affect academic careers (university of chicago press, 2009)in a recent study, i found academics to have far from definitive and emphatic enthusiasm for academic careers, despite the relative prestige of the academic profession -- although this, too, has eroded over time. the american academic profession has reached the point where more faculty members hold non-tenureline appointments than those who do. it will become increasingly difficult to say how such a community constitutes a bona fide profession when it consists of an ever more disparate array of career lines and commitments.by one view, this may be a more cost-effective means to conduct business, particularly instruction, but it forms a particularly weak foundation for meaningful work over time, and it suspends the idea of academic communities constituted by scholarship. we have already begun to see, in both public and private institutions, a stratification system of careers, wherein a smaller proportion of faculty members follow the once-standard model with traditional appointments and more are appointed on a fixed-term basis. the stratification of academic careers will very likely intensify over the next quarter-century, as financing for higher education continues to fall, and as universities sort out how to operate under these conditions.what will academic careers be like for the few who are able to secure regular appointments? there is evidence to suggest that they will be nasty and brutish, but not short. those who have recently entered academe will, in most cases, lead entirely different careers than those who have recently retired. achievement expectations in all of the roles academics perform have intensified, and they will continue to do so and become more formalized -- a hallmark of a highly rationalized, bureaucratic system. institutions of all types now compete vigorously for capital, including capital in the form of prestige.this evolution, while entailing some benefits, will also bring significant costs. faculty work, not only in the pre-tenure years, is now and will remain utterly competitive to the point where it will lead many to wonder, as it has already, whether rewards derived from academic work justify its tolls. when expectations are high, the prospect of disappointment increases, and seeds of dissatisfaction are spread. the likelihood of dissatisfaction will be highest in fields characterized by relatively high consensus -- that is, in fields where practitioners generally agree about standards of performance, such as physics and chemistry. ironically, the chance of dissatisfaction will be lower in fields that are conversely in a state of disarray, such as sociology and education, since it is easier to satisfy one of many prevailing definitions of success.changed economic conditions combined with changes in retirement plans will more than likely mean that academics now at midcareer, and all those younger, will not be able to retire until their 70s. the mixed blessing: academe will, for some, entail lifelong employment. more than ever before, individuals will be pressed to find the value in pursuing an academic career, but, as in all times, several may develop ingenious ways of finding it.evelyn hu-dehartprofessor of history and ethnic studies at brown university and director of the center for the study of race and ethnicity in americathe clues are already planted, if one cares to look. i shall highlight three interrelated trends that will intensify with time: growing stratification among institutions by mission and within institutions by fields; diminishing prospects for faculty diversity; and eroding faculty governance in the face of growing concentration of decision-making authority in the administration. if we cast our gaze over higher education in 20 years, this may be what we see:broadly speaking, higher-education institutions are stratified in two tiers: at the narrow top of the pyramid lies a handful of well-endowed elite and privileged public and private research institutions with highly selective undergraduate admissions and graduate programs organized primarily around producing ph.d.'s, m.d.'s, j.d.'s, and m.b.a.'s. the faculty by and large have degrees from the same group of institutions, are hired on the tenure-track system, and aspire to achieving tenure, and thus lifetime employment security. indeed, departmental faculty members at this type of institution are typically highly tenured, largely white, and male. the core humanities faculty continues to deliver a strong liberal-arts education to undergraduates, most of whom receive their degrees in four years. but their fields have lost a lot of ground and status to the quantitative-driven social sciences and, especially, to the biomedical sciences, where academic work is oriented toward raising prodigious amounts of external research dollars that underwrite their mega-laboratories and finance their doctoral and postdoctoral teams. their presence on campus is further marked by impressive new buildings, centers, and institutes. meanwhile, the largess of wealthy private donors helps maintain high-status professional fields in medicine, law, and business.with promotion and raises evaluated primarily by research productivity and successful grant making, with teaching a far second, this privileged research faculty has practically no time or inclination to serve on committees that had historically driven faculty governance. this is just as well for deans and provosts, who have assumed the role of permanent managers and decision makers.these are also precisely the fields that have historically failed to attract, train, and mentor historical american minority-group members into the research professoriate, although they have done well by white women, whose ranks have risen impressively in these quantitative and revenue-generating fields. diversity is largely gender-driven, while racial and ethnic diversity, by necessity, is stretched to include international, transnational, and immigrant scholars -- the african and west indian, the latin american and asian. at the deep base of the pyramid are the majority of postsecondary institutions, most of them public and minimally selective. they are the myriad of community colleges and many state colleges; together they enroll the vast majority of students pursuing postsecondary education. their mission is to teach and credential students -- many of them people of color, low-income, first-generation, nontraditional -- for a fast-changing global economy. only a small proportion of the faculty is full time and tenured. most are contract employees -- casual academic workers who constitute a flexible labor pool whose members can be easily laid off, recalled, or replaced as state budgets dictate. they deliver courses as much online as in a traditional classroom.these lower-tier institutions attract few private donors and practically no research grants. faculty governance is not even remotely part of the academic culture. but diversity is visible and meaningful here, for these institutions do provide opportunities for american minority-group members to pursue an academic career in teaching or administration.peter n. stearnsprovost of george mason universityi'm always impressed with the fragility of predictions, ever since, in grade school, i assumed everyone would be riding in helicopters by the 1960s. but i was asked, so here goes:* we will see more cases in which gender balances are so routine as to require little notice; progress on other types of diversity will also have occurred, but with more gaps remaining.* family commitments for younger faculty, including fathers, will continue to run high, leading to new challenges to carrying out committee assignments and building community. this pattern, along with increased comfort with electronic communication, will lead to far more virtual meetings and distance courses taught in part from home. the holy grail of a separate office for each full-time faculty member will be abandoned in this process, in favor of alternate-day sharing.* more faculty members (particularly those past the child-raising stage) will routinely spend two-week or semester segments teaching abroad, as part of joint or dual-degree programs with foreign universities; and visiting colleagues, correspondingly, will be spending time on american campuses through a new surge of globalization in higher education. it will be interesting to see if current standards differentials between american professors and even their european colleagues even out a bit.* basic reward patterns will not change greatly, with a premium on research, although more diverse forms of refereed publication will be accepted. solidification of assessment will, however, place a greater premium on demonstrated learning results in the evaluation of faculty teaching, with continuing disputes about out-of-classroom evidence. more comfort with interdisciplinary and inter-unit appointments will develop.* pressure to increase faculty productivity will intensify substantially. this will lead to some overreliance (at least in terms of real economies in pedagogy) on distance delivery and continued use of adjunct instructors. to defend full-time positions, particularly in fields devoid of major research financing, institutions may press for slightly greater teaching loads. tenure will be challenged, and might in some cases actually be modified to cover, say, 20 years of a career (as a gesture to core protection of academic freedom) followed by renewable appointments based on productivity. more successful faculty members will work on through their 70s.any set of predictions depends on some mix of extrapolating from current trends and hypothesizing newer directions. forecasts about family-centeredness, more technology, and more diversity build on things already in gestation. a more global framework for careers and productivity that might produce structural modifications (if the profession is not hopelessly to divide between a successful minority and a growing horde of transients) would represent a major departure from current patterns.in terms of faculty satisfactions: i'm predicting a bit less on the lifetime-security side, a bit more ease with home-work balance and with technology links, a bit more orientation toward the pleasures of global experience. the sum total is not, probably, a revolution in rewards and anxieties, although there will be a few hot debates to anticipate over the next two decades.cathy ann trowerresearch director at the collaborative on academic careers in higher education (coache) at harvard university's graduate school of educationi envision two possible but very different academic worlds 20 years from now. one is the path of least resistance -- maintaining the status quo. if we do not reimagine the academic workplace and change the supporting culture, practices, and policies accordingly, one possibility is that it will look much like it does today, but with still fewer tenured and tenure-track faculty. if current trends continue (from a third of the professoriate tenured in 1997 to one-fourth in 2007), or slow slightly, it is likely that only around 20 percent of all instructional staff will be tenured or on the tenure-track. faculty members then will be less satisfied than today because they will have had to assimilate and compromise their generation's values (collaboration, transparency, community, flexibility, diversity, interdisciplinarity, work-life integration) to fit into the mold created and institutionalized many years ago by ""traditionalists"" (competition, secrecy, autonomy, uniformity, homogeneity, disciplinary silos, 24/7 careers). we are, in 2009, seeing signs of decline as doctoral students vote with their feet -- heading to the private sector, the government, or other nonprofits. a recent study of over 8,000 doctoral students in the university of california system showed that upon beginning their studies, 45 percent of men and 39 percent of women wanted to pursue careers as professors with an emphasis on research, but those percentages dropped to 36 percent and 27 percent respectively as time progressed. in the sciences, the shift was more dramatic. why? for both men and women, a major factor was the perceived inflexibility of an academic career at a research university; and for women, being unable to reconcile family life with career pressures in this environment.the other path will require rule remaking that reflects the 21st-century global, social, demographic, economic, and technological realities, as well as the values of new faculty members and doctoral students. we should ask them what they would like if given the opportunity to rethink, and possibly rewrite, the current system.in this scenario, i believe the academy will continue to attract the best and brightest, and that they will thrive in their academic careers. there will be still more interdisciplinary centers and institutes with faculty and students working together solving problems. most faculty members will no longer have to be equally outstanding at research and teaching; instead, while some will perform both functions, the majority will specialize in one or the other. rungs will disappear, replaced with lattices that allow movement in many directions. the up-or-out tenure system will be reformed to be more flexible; in fact, faculty members may be less concerned about lifelong job security than about producing the highest quality research and teaching at the highest levels, utilizing technology in ways that haven't been conceived in 2009.whatever is to be, i hope that we don't wait 20 years to make dramatic changes; the time for reform is now.",7/10/09,0,0,1,,,0

4TR5-FT70-TWCM-K1H8-00000-00.txt,"things may be slowing down in many an industry, but for career coaches, ***economic downturn**s mean a spike in business. as the field has grown in recent years, the downsized and the anxious have become increasingly likely to consult with a coach, whether it's for advice about landing a job in a particular field or for some soul-searching talk about a career change. at the five o'clock club, a 30-year-old network that offers career-coaching through some 60 independent counselors, clients have doubled over the past year, says founder kate wendelton. ""in the old days seeing a career coach was a big stigma,"" she says. ""now people seek out a career coach the same way they seek out a dentist or a trainer or whatever.""  and the field will only continue to grow, believes dennis garritan, who oversees the training programs at new york university, one of a handful of schools that offer training and certification for career coaches. he sees demand coming from both retiring baby boomers and millennials graduating from college. ""these are the kids who had little league coaches, chess-camp coaches and sat coaches. they have that expectation, so they're primed beautifully to work with a career coach.""  but what exactly does a career coach do? offer job-seeking strategies? help people sick of their work figure out what they'd enjoy? inspect resumes? give moral support to the downsized and dejected? the answer is that they do all of the above, plus offer counsel on any number of other issues that come into play when people stand at a career crossroads - or, for that matter, when they need to negotiate a salary, or are looking to climb within an organization. ""it's anything that's around the job space - getting it, how to do that; keeping it, how to do that,"" says win sheffield, who left a career in finance to become a coach five years ago. to get some insight into what kinds of help career coaches can offer, @work spoke with three new yorkers who made career transitions with the help of one, whether the process involved assessing their skills, identifying new goals, developing strategy or all of the above. same role, new opportunity  david billig spent 10 years working in the press office of the new york city fire department, and doesn't have a bad word to say about the experience. ""it was a career beyond careers,"" he says. ""i had planned to stay there forever."" so how was it that several years ago he found himself consulting with ruth shapiro, a veteran manhattan career coach? ""i'm not sure i have an answer,"" he says, after thinking a moment. ""it's just time. you get a little older and it was time for a change.""  the problem, though, was that he had no idea what he actually wanted to do. and he couldn't see what his skills qualified him to do besides more of the same. a 44-year-old flushing native, he'd started his career as an emergency medical technician for a private ambulance company, and then moved over to the city's emergency medical services unit. over time he'd worked his way up into the press office, and when ems merged with the fire department in 1996, he became a public information officer there, and eventually the department's press secretary. perhaps the most important thing he learned when he started consulting with shapiro, whom he found through an internet search, was that his experience had more market value than he realized. ""if you're in a job for a long time, that's what you do, that's what you know,"" he says. ""you don't realize the skill sets you develop over the years, and the things you can do with the skills you've acquired.""  he also picked a sense of the sheer range of possibilities out there, and the insight that ""for every civil service job there's a comparable private-sector job.""  that still left the question of what exactly to do, so he went through the evaluation process shapiro uses on new clients. it includes some aptitude testing as well as a questionnaire asking clients to discuss not only their paid jobs but, shapiro says, also ""any experience, going back to when you were a kid, where you did work you felt good about.""  the testing suggested billig had an aptitude for sales, which interested him. and talking to him about his experiences, shapiro zeroed in on his emt experience, and his interest in the medical field. ""i thought, going to a place like the health-care field would make a lot of sense if that interested him,"" she says. so when a friend told him about a job as media relations director at westchester medical center, he applied. he started a year and a half ago, and says he's found in the job exactly what he was looking for. ""it's exciting, it's challenging,"" he says. ""i'm working in basically the same capacity as i did for the fire department, but i'm able to do some different things and grow professionally."" the new challenges include putting his sales instincts to work by working on advertising and other marketing efforts for the hospital - and even producing promotional radio spots. ""i'm doing things never thought i'd do before,"" he says. - chris erikson  from nonprofit world to the corporate life  after 15 years or so in the workforce, many people are looking to escape the corporate world. judy sandford had a different issue - she wanted in. an english lit major, she'd gone to work for a travel magazine after graduating from trinity college, but soon decided the pay was too low and the industry too unstable. combining her editorial skills with her interest in graphic design, she ended up doing marketing work for a nonprofit, which after six years led to a similar job for the city's economic development corp. she liked the work, but after five years was itching for a new challenge, and decided she wanted to move to the corporate sector, working in the burgeoning field of corporate responsibility. ""i felt like my nonprofit experiences had become repetitive,"" she says. ""i was looking for more opportunity, more variety and the ability to grow my salary.""  she earned an mba from nyu, but even then found the bridge into corporate work hard to cross. it's not an uncommon experience, says win sheffield, the coach she eventually turned to for help. ""the typical thing is that corporate people think nonprofit people are lightweights, and nonprofit people think corporate people don't care about anything,"" he says. ""so you have to learn to articulate things in a way so that people take you seriously."" after sandford connected with sheffield through the five o'clock club, one of the biggest things he helped her with was learning to speak the language of business - to say ""generating revenues"" rather than ""raising funds,"" for example - and make a case for the relevance of her experience. he also coached her on networking, something she'd always found difficult, but which became ""second nature."" and he offered support when her confidence waned, and otherwise made a daunting task feel more manageable. ""a job search is such a personal thing that emotions can get in the way,"" she says. at those times, sheffield ""was able to identify what the challenges were and say, 'look, this is what you need to be doing.' and very quickly you have some clear steps to follow, and it takes away that overwhelming feeling of, oh my god, how am i going to make this happen?""  today, thanks in part to her networking efforts, sandford works in her targeted field, as a corporateresponsibility strategist for a creative services firm, advising fortune 1000 companies. and it's turned out to be everything she'd hoped for. ""it combines everything i've been interested in. i get to write, i get to work with designers, and consult with an incredible variety of companies, helping them understand how to be socially responsible. it's all the things we're reading about in the news, so it feels like everything i'm doing is very cutting-edge,"" she says. ""it's my dream job."" - c.e. taking the initiative  betsy kent moved to new york from ohio to work in the fashion industry, and spent 10 years working on seventh avenue. but when the travel started getting to her, she shifted gears, taking what would become the first of many jobs in advertising sales. she worked for a community newspaper, a publishing group, and eventually became a sales executive for an firm selling yellow pages ads. unhappy there for a variety of reasons, she decided it was time to look for another sales job. then she came to a realization: she didn't want another sales job. ""i was overworked, and tired of going in and out of businesses all day long,"" she says. ""i wanted to use my skill set to do something different, but i had no idea what that might be.""  that's what brought her to the office of bettina seidman, who became a career coach 18 years ago after two decades of working in human resources. as she typically does with new clients, seidman - the president of the career counselors consortium, whose members include some 50 nyc- area coaches - asked kent to talk freely about what she cared about and what her goals were.

(about 2.3 million were infected in 2007.) achieving that outcome would cost $722 billion over 22 years, or nearly $8,000 for each infection prevented. (condoms are cheap, but the price includes drugs that lower viral levels and prevent mother-to-child transmission.)  their economic models assumed that condoms, drugs and circumcision would become widespread but that a microbicide and a vaccine would not.  rapidly developing countries like brazil, china, india, mexico and russia should be able to pay for fighting their own relatively small epidemics, the authors said. southern african countries will need only some help, despite having the world's highest aids rates. but much of africa, and especially kenya, mozambique, uganda and zambia, will remain heavily dependent on donors.  given the ***economic crisis**, rich countries may come up with only 30 percent of what is needed; they come up with 43 percent now.

4RY0-G3H0-TW8F-G12F-00000-00.txt,"ben s. bernanke, chairman of the federal reserve, signaled his readiness on wednesday to bolster the economy with cheaper money even though inflation is picking up speed.  the fed chairman acknowledged that the central bank faced increasingly contradictory pressures of slowing growth and rising consumer prices. but his bottom line was that, for now, the top priority would be fighting a ***recession** rather than fighting inflation.   mr. bernanke's view of the state of the economy, part of his semiannual appearance before congress, came as the dollar sank to a historic low against other major currencies, introducing a possible third dimension to the economic problems the fed chairman must tackle all at once.  having already cut short-term interest rates by almost half since september, mr. bernanke painted a grim picture of consumers reluctant to spend, businesses reluctant to invest and banks reluctant to lend. on top of it all, housing prices keep falling.  ''the economic situation has become distinctly less favorable'' since last summer, he told the house financial services committee. in words that investors immediately recognized as a hint of lower rates, he vowed to ''act in a timely manner'' and ''provide adequate insurance against downside risks.''  the fed's decision to err on the side of faster growth poses risks. ever since the wrenching experience with stagflation in the late 1970s, the rule of thumb in monetary policy has been that revving up a slow economy is far easier than slowing inflation once it becomes entrenched.  the hope is that lower interest rates will encourage consumers and businesses to spend more, while the risk is that the spending will aggravate inflation.  but the success or failure of the fed's strategy could depend on something outside mr. bernanke's immediate control: foreign confidence in the american dollar and foreign willingness to keep financing the united states' huge external debt.  the dollar has plunged 24 percent against a basket of six major currencies in the last four years, and on wednesday it slipped to its lowest level yet since the united states let the dollar float freely in 1973.  a weak dollar can be both good and bad for the united states economy. it tends to bolster american exports by making them cheaper in foreign markets, but it also pushes up inflation by raising the cost of foreign imports. and while the united states pays for foreign oil in dollars, many analysts contend that part of the recent run-up in oil prices was tied to the steadily declining value of the dollar.  over the long haul, the bigger worry for mr. bernanke may not be import prices as much as interest rates and the dollar's value.  huge inflows of cheap foreign capital helped keep interest rates for mortgages and businesses low even as the fed raised its benchmark overnight rates from 2004 to 2006.  if foreign investors become more wary, in part because of the dollar's declining value, some economists worry they will not invest in the united states unless they get higher long-term interest rates -- even as the fed lowers its overnight rate.  ''i don't think there is any great danger of hitting a trigger point where people cut and run from the dollar,'' said kenneth rogoff, a professor of economics at harvard and a former director of research at the international monetary fund. ''but there are hidden costs. the dollar's pre-eminence in the international financial system provides a huge bonanza to the united states. we pay lower interest rates than we would otherwise. we can probably borrow money on short notice more easily than we could otherwise.''  mr. bernanke did not mention the dollar's falling value on wednesday, but he has said on previous occasions that he saw no sign that the dollar was in danger of losing its status as the world's leading reserve currency.  on wednesday, mr. bernanke carefully acknowledged that inflation had accelerated in recent months and would make the fed's job much more difficult if it became ingrained in public expectations.  ''any tendency of inflation expectations to become unmoored or for the federal reserve's inflation-fighting credibility to be eroded would greatly complicate the task of sustaining price stability and could reduce the flexibility of the f.o.m.c,'' mr. bernanke warned, referring to the federal open market committee, which sets interest rates.   ''accordingly, in the months ahead, the federal reserve will continue to closely monitor inflation and inflation expectations,'' mr. bernanke said.  but mr. bernanke made it clear that fed officials are more worried about a sharp slowdown and rising unemployment than they are concerned about inflation.   the fed's assumption is that slower economic growth will reduce inflationary pressure in the months ahead, because debt-laden consumers will be far more wary of spending money and businesses will be more cautious about investing in plant and equipment.  though the fed is still predicting that the economy will narrowly escape a ***recession**, policy makers have sharply cut their forecasts for growth in 2008 to less than 2 percent and expect almost no expansion during the first six months of this year.  at the hearing on wednesday, mr. bernanke cautioned that even the newer bleaker forecast could prove optimistic. he predicted that the housing downturn would continue to slow the economy ''in the coming quarters,'' noting that financial markets are still in turmoil and that credit has become more difficult to get.   consumer spending has ''slowed significantly,'' he said,  in part because of rising gasoline prices, slowing job growth and the decline in household wealth as a result of falling home prices.  on wall street, investors and analysts expressed relief that the fed was indeed ready to lower rates again. it has already reduced the federal funds rate to 3 percent from 5.25 percent since september, and investors had already been betting that fed officials would lower it to 2.5 percent at its next meeting on march 18.  ''we think bernanke is (finally) right on'' in placing top priority on fighting a ***recession**, wrote bernard baumohl, managing director of the economic outlook group in princeton, n.j.  but some experts were sharply critical.  ''they're doing the same stupid things they did in the 1970s,'' said allan h. meltzer, a professor of economics at carnegie mellon university and the leading historian of fed policy. ''they were always saying that we're not going to let inflation get out of hand, that we're going to tackle it once the economy starts growing, but they never did it.''   even some economists who have warned about a ***recession** for more than a year now expressed worry that the fed's policy of lower interest rates, combined with slowing growth and credit market problems, could undermine foreign confidence in the dollar, driving up both interest rates and inflation.  ''i'm still of the view that the downside risks to the economy are more important than the inflation risks, but at some point the ability of the fed to cut rates will be limited by the willingness of the rest of the world to finance the current account deficit,'' said nouriel roubini, president of roubini global economics in new york, referring to the broadest measure of   the nation's trade and investment balance.",2/28/08,1,1,1,,,1

(zito was a patient there off and on and reportedly did relatively well when he took his medications.)without the center, those in crisis could end up in confrontations with police or in hospital emergency rooms ill-equipped to take care of them.some of the eastern shore clients are said to have drug dependency issues along with their mental illnesses.  local political leaders have attempted to get the shutdown orders rescinded and may succeed because the need is obvious and powerful political figures are involved in the matter.many of these local leaders are republicans. some democrats might not mind letting them twist slowly in the wind as if powerless to take care of their constituents. democrats might quietly enjoy that view because they feel republicans oppose everything the o'malley administration has done to manage the ***recession**-stoked budget implosion.but democrats may have to stifle that pleasure.kent county and the surrounding largely conservative 1st congressional district is now represented by democrat frank kratovil, who would love to demonstrate his political effectiveness. with a rematch promised with hyper-conservative state sen. andy harris, kratovil wants to show that his democratic connections are indispensable in a situation such as this.much of the pressure falls ultimately on gov. martin o'malley. he doesn't want to leave the shore unprotected. and he would like to help mr. kratovil.  no good optionsjust what the governor might do instead is the question. no one would have considered closing the upper shore facility if there were better options.having cut hundreds of millions of dollars from his budget already, o'malley has announced another $233 million must be pared away soon to keep this year's budget in balance. then he must account for another $1 billion to $2 billion in the budget he must present to the legislature in january.such are the dreary revenue forecasts. recovery may be coming but not soon enough.o'malley has, so far, done his cutting without erosion of support among the voters. a recent sampling by gonzales research and marketing strategies gives him a substantial lead over former governor robert l. ehrlich jr. if they were to face off again. o'malley will almost certainly run for re-election. ehrlich is being urged to run, but he's said nothing about his plans.that electoral backdrop may ease o'malley's mind a bit. on the other hand, the poll shows no support for tax increases of any kind. the governor has said public education spending will continue without reduction.with no additional revenue and certain aspects of the budget off limits, programs like the one in chestertown become targets.political considerations may rescue the upper shore facility this time. but the time is likely coming when nothing can rescue important services.c. fraser smith is senior news analyst for wypr-fm. his column appears fridays in the daily record. his e-mail address is fsmith@wypr.org",9/25/09,0,1,0,,,1

""the stock is down because everything is down; the market has been revalued so everything has to be revalued.""though to some degree guilt by sector association was to blame, investors were also a little spooked by aflac's short-term sales outlook. just operating in two countries --- japan, which accounts for 75 percent of revenue, and the united states --- aflacis facing the specter of slowing product sales with both nations mired in ***recession**, nadel said.and aflac, like other insurers, takes customer premiums and invests them in corporate and sovereign debt obligations. but its $60.5 billion investment portfolio took a hit after last year's market tumult and collapse of several financial services firms whose debt aflacowned. third-quarter profits plunged.the company --- taking investment losses of $389 million because of holdings in ford motor and the now-failed lehman bros. and washington mutual --- reported profit of $100 million in last year's third quarter, down 76 percent from the $420 million reported for the comparable period in 2007.aflacalso warned it will take a charge of $110 million to cover the losses it incurred from the collapse of iceland's three-largest banks.""the problem for aflacand every other life insurance company is the overhang of doubt,"" said donald light, an insurance analyst at celent, a financial services research and consulting firm. ""the unfortunate part of the iceland bonds is iceland, while small, is one of the more spectacular liquidity failures.""and steven d. schwartz, an analyst with raymond james, says aflachas between $100 million and $850 million in additional securities that could be considered troubled --- the biggest being a $337 million stake in citigroup inc.mortgages avoidedall told, portfolio losses last year will be among aflac's worst since 2003, when italian dairy company parmalat collapsed under a massive auditing fraud scheme. that year, aflac's portfolio loss also exceeded $100 million.while last year's losses were severe, the company has largely avoided its competitors' missteps, such as directly investing in mortgage-backed securities, analysts say.""they were able to avoid a lot of investments related to mortgages; that's the biggest reason,"" said troy harmon, senior research analyst at the henssler financial group in atlanta. the other was aflac's less-than-1-percent exposure to annuities, or regular payments insurance firms make to people who purchase them. other insurance firms, as a way to compete for customer dollars, began adding guaranteed investment clauses to annuity policies, effectively promising a set return. but as bond yields have fallen and several investment categories have been battered, competitors who offered those guarantees, including metlife and genworth financial, have had to continue to pay the promised returns, harmon said.aflacexecutives credit the firm's long-standing investment strategy of staying away from speculative securities --- such as junk bonds and debt issues that are below investment grade --- as helping its portfolio performance.it's conservative, but not too conservative.""if we were to be ultra-conservative we wouldn't be able to generate the returns we need [to pay out obligations]. you can only do so much in the risk-reward equation,"" kenneth s. janke jr., aflac's senior vice president of investor relations, said during a recent interview.""we're pretty comfortable in the way we've approached the market, and i don't think we would have done anything differently.""that includes how and what sectors within which it invests.big stake in financialsthough most of its business comes from japan, 42 percent of aflac's investment portfolio was in banks and financials at the end of september. japan's government bonds form the next largest holdings chunk --- 15 percent.""we really don't have a lot of investment exposure to japan, because japan doesn't really have a developed corporate bond market,"" janke said.the company owns corporate and sovereign debt securities in 42 different countries all denominated in japanese yen.even though banks worldwide have been beaten down in the fall of the world economy, janke said a 42 percent weighting in financials shouldn't be too alarming because the portfolio has been historically overweight in the sector.

4R0V-4NF0-TWDH-N0GN-00000-00.txt,"to those who believe in the repetitive nature of history, it's fitting that the subprime ***mortgage crisis** is occurring exactly a century after the panic of 1907.that episode ended when the u.s. treasury persuaded j.p. morgan to organize a syndicate of his fellow financiers that would extend credit and buy up battered shares.today, morgan's successors again are meeting under treasury auspices in an attempt to calm a troubled market. but instead of trying to stop bank runs and a stock market crash, they're worried about an obscure creation called the structured investment vehicle.banks created more than $320 billion worth of these off-balance-sheet creatures, known as sivs. they borrow money in the short-term commercial paper market and invest it in a variety of fixed-income securities, some of which are backed by subprime mortgages.an siv is very profitable when things go well. but when cracks start to appear, the structure can fall apart quickly. no one is going to buy an siv's commercial paper if they think it is insolvent. recently, the subprime mortgage market has deteriorated so fast that it's hard to tell whether the sivs are solvent.enter treasury secretary henry paulson, who announced the outlines of an siv bailout plan nearly two weeks ago. citigroup, bank of americaand j.p. morgan chasewould set up a new entity to acquire assets of sivs that have run into liquidity problems.the banks have emphasized that this entity, which some people are calling a super-siv, would only buy solid assets, not subprime paper. they're trying to avoid a fire sale, where troubled sivs must liquidate and everything - good assets as well as bad - gets marked down in price.""while a number of big banks have written the value of some of their assets this summer, there is still some reckoning to be done,"" said carl tannenbaum, chief economist at lasalle bank in chicago. ""the super-siv is designed to assist in that process.""stuart greenbaum, an emeritus professor at washington university's olin school of business, says he sees the need for someone to buy the sivs' assets. ""this would provide, if it works, a huge liquidity infusion,"" he said. ""that would conceivably give the system time to work out the problems it has, if they are liquidity problems and not solvency problems.""the trouble is that citigroup, an organizer of the bailout, also has been the biggest sponsor of sivs. that's going to hurt the credibility of the super-siv.after all, lack of transparency already is the biggest problem with these things. and when one entity created by citigroupis shuffling paper over to another entity created by citigroup, it's hard to be confident that the price is the right one.scott colbert, director of fixed income at commerce trust co., thinks the credibility problem is a large one. ""it's another way of keeping these things off the balance sheet for longer and hoping to unwind them,"" he said.colbert suggests that instead of creating a new, opaque vehicle to bail out something that's already complex and opaque, the big banks should have put $100 billion into a joint-venture hedge fund to buy assets from sivs.that would be similar to the way investment firms handled the successful wind-down in 1998 of long term capital management, a failed hedge fund.it also would be in the spirit of j.p. morgan, who knew that in times of panic, only those with the deepest pockets can restore calm.",10/28/07,1,1,1,,,1

""you don't have to check a bag.""sorensen said u.s. carriers will run into trouble charging fees on codeshare flights, where a ticket on, say, fee-charging delta, might have been sold by partner air france, which checks two bags for free.airline fares have fallen sharply in the ***recession**, and many in the industry have argued that fees are basically a way to make up some of the shortfall. luggage is expensive to handle and its weight makes the plane burn more jet fuel, so it makes sense for that service to cost something, the thinking goes.delta originally said it would charge a second-bag fee on all international flights, not just those to europe. its announcement in april said it hoped to collect $100 million a year if the new fee went worldwide. it scaled back that plan to just europe after other carriers didn't match it. delta declined to make an executive available to talk about the fee.joe brancatelli, who runs the business travel web site joesentme.com, said european airline customers are much more used to paying fees, whereas asian airlines have maintained a more full-service approach, even in coach.through august, united and delta (with its northwest subsidiary) carried the most traffic to asia, while delta and american were the biggest u.s. carriers to europe.the new fees are coming from a shrinking number of travelers. traffic between north america and europe on all airlines fell 12 percent to 25.4 million travelers through the first half of this year compared with the first half of 2008, according to the international air transport association.travelers pushing baggage carts out of the international arrival section at minneapolis-st. paul international airport generally felt the same way about international baggage fees as they would about an overeager customs officer.""it does concern me, because i travel a lot doing mission work, so a lot of times i have full luggage,"" said sammy wanyonyi, an evangelist from victoria, minn. his gear includes cameras and lots of clothes for his trips to east and central africa.when he left minneapolis, he was told he could check up to 70 pounds in each bag. but traveling back from nairobi, on another airline, the limit was 50 pounds - which nearly put him and two other short-term missionaries he was traveling with in a bind until the airline waived the extra fees.""the most disconcerting thing is it seems like each place has its own rules,"" he said.jerry and lori white are already experienced at dodging baggage fees on domestic u.s. flights. they live in saudi arabia but come back to the u.s. once a year for a month or so. while they're here, they leave their luggage with family while they fly between minnesota and texas and other stops to avoid paying baggage fees. they may have to get craftier to avoid the fees coming back from saudi arabia, though.after getting off a flight from amsterdam for this year's trip, jerry white said they'll be even choosier about which airlines they fly if the u.s. carriers expand baggage fees to more international flights.""we hate to fly the ones that only allow one bag,"" lori white said. ""it's not worth it. we won't fly american for a lot of reasons; one of them is the bag fees.""the international carriers are not alone in exploring new things to charge for. southwest airlines co., which flies only in the u.s. and still doesn't charge baggage fees, began charging $10 to reserve a spot in the boarding line. a better spot in line has value because most southwest passengers get their seats on a first-come, first-served basis.southwest said when it launched the ""early bird"" program that it hoped to raise perhaps $75 million a year in new revenue. the trick will be selling the spot in line without annoying regular customers, as well as ""business select"" customers who still get to be first in line but might settle for the cheaper ""early bird"" approach instead.kevin krone, southwest's vice president of marketing, said they don't expect business select travelers to buy the early bird passes instead. as for traditional southwest fliersa back in the line, ""we don't anticipate that large enough numbers of people will take advantage of it that it will ultimately impact the boarding experience for those that don't purchase it,"" he said.30",9/28/09,0,0,1,,,0

adverse ratio to proliferation of other forms of gambling -- lotteries and casinos, for instance.in addition, the sport's reputation has suffered after years of vocal denunciation from animal welfare groups over the treatment of dogs, while seven states have banned the sport altogether. massachusetts was the last to do so, in 2008.cameron county isn't immune from trends dogging the industry, judging from valley race park officials' august request to the texas racing commission for permission to cancel the harlingen facility's 2009 and 2010 live racing seasons.the commission granted the request at its sept. 15 meeting, which means 15 race dates scheduled for nov. 29 through dec. 30 at the park won't happen. simulcast racing events will be held year round, though live racing isn't scheduled to return to the park until the summer of 2011, when vrp and the texas greyhound association plan to stage a five-day \""festival of racing\"" event with live racing, entertainment and other attractions.pulling live races from vrp for the next two seasons is intended to \""stabilize\"" greyhound racing in texas and allow the state's three dog racing facilities to operate and contribute purse money to the one texas park that will continue to feature live racing: gulf greyhound park, in la marque just north of galveston.andrea young, the vrp's president and chief operating officer, concedes that live races are expensive to stage, though vrp will hold them again in 2011. she says the plan to skip 2009-10 \""provides short-term relief to the industry's participants while allowing us to develop a marquee event to enhance the live racing experience for patrons.\""young says the texas dog racing industry is up against heavy competition from states like arkansas, iowa and west virginia, while the number of texas-bred greyhounds has dwindled to about 2,000 a year from 6,000 a year eight years ago.the issue is similar to horse racing, where breeders have moved their breeding operations to states that offer the highest purses. the states with the highest purses are the ones that have introduced other forms of gambling -- such as slot machines -- into their racetracks.\""our steep decline and why arkansas and other states are giving us so much competition is directly attributable to the additional forms of gaming that now exist in those states,\"" young says.race parks in several other states have turned to slot machines or video gaming terminals as an antidote to falling attendance and revenue, though they remain illegal in texas. the state's racing lobby has tried for years to persuade lawmakers to allow slot machine gambling, though efforts so far haven't been successful. the 82nd legislature, which kicks off in january 2011, will hear a round of similar pleas from texas tracks.\""we'll be working very hard to educate (lawmakers) on the state of the industry and the amount of money leaving the state and how we can help create jobs in texas, which is important in these economic times and ultimately bring money and tax revenues back to texas.\""mike lavigne, spokesman for win for texas, a group of track owners and other interests that want the legislature to allow slots at tracks, says doing so would again make texas attractive from the breeder's perspective.\""if we have slot machines at race tracks you're going to augment those purses,\"" he says. \""we could have the largest purses in the nation. that's not a stretch.\""lavigne notes that changing the law would require a constitutional amendment, which requires a statewide vote. public opinion appears to support a change, which might have more support among lawmakers since state coffers have suffered during the ***recession**, he says.\""if the stars were ever aligned, 2011 is the year,\"" lavigne says.young, noting the decline in dog track attendance, doesn't think it's because greyhound racing is less popular, but because there are so many more ways to gamble nowadays -- like slots.\""it's still a product that people enjoy and appreciate, but people now have more that offer more immediate gratification,\"" she says.the future of harlingen's dog track,

7WVP-NGC0-Y8YF-Y1XR-00000-00.txt,"practitioners of the dismal science, as economics is often known, are probably less dismal these days than the public at large. one doesn't have to listen to many economists, though, to hear plenty of warnings about the dangers that lie ahead.more than 80 percent of economists believe the ***recession** is over, according to a survey released monday by the national association for business economics. nabe's annual convention, which concludes today in st. louis, even carries an optimistic subtitle: ""gateway to recovery.""the survey also predicts, however, that unemployment will remain at 9.5 percent a year from now. lawrence summers, president barack obama's top economic adviser, told the group that a jobless recovery will be a big problem.""each percentage point of unemployment adds substantially to the government debt, subtracts from our capital stock and limits our human potential,"" summers said monday. he added that obama's administration is committed to measures that will stimulate demand and make credit available to consumers and businesses.some private-sector economists also said they support such initiatives. mark zandi, chief economist at moody'seconomy.com, listed at least $100 billion worth of measures that he would like to see in a new economic stimulus bill.that price tag would cover extending unemployment benefits, keeping a credit for first-time home buyers in place until june, and prolonging some temporary business tax breaks.""the economy is going to need more help going into next year,"" zandi said. ""unless the job market changes, this recovery is unlikely to evolve into a self-sustaining economic expansion.""in arguing for more intervention in the economy, both summers and zandi invoked a concept known as the output gap. that's the difference between what the nation is producing now and what it could produce in a theoretical state of full employment.the nabe delegates alsoheard a warning about such analysis. james bullard, president of the st. louis federal reserve bank, said sunday that economists may be overestimating the size of the gap.""the narrative is that the output gap must be large since the ***recession** is severe, and so any medium-term inflation threat is negligible,"" bullard said. ""i think this narrative overplays the output gap story for understanding medium-term risks.""the gap can't be measured accurately, he noted, and inflation became a problem when economists underestimated it in the 1970s. moreover, output-gap theory doesn't account for something like a housing bubble.""if part or most of the fall in output was a collapsed bubble, then today's output gap would be smaller than it appears,"" bullard said.bullard's former boss, bill poole, also is worried that some measures taken during the crisis will be hard to unwind. the fed, for example, is committed to buy $1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed securities by next march to prop up the housing market.""the housing and mortgage industry is one of the most politically sensitive sectors in the entire economy,"" said poole, a former st. louis fed president who is now a senior fellow at the cato institute. ""the fed may indeed find itself under pressure to continue buying, because mortgage rates otherwise would rise.""if bullard and poole are correct, we're in danger of making policy mistakes that will cause a surge in inflation. if summers and zandi are correct, the danger lies in the other direction, of not doing enough to bring down unemployment.even when they're in an optimistic mood, these economists can be pretty dismal.",10/13/09,1,1,1,,,1

""we think it has a certain value, and we've placed a very high value on that, and in today's market it's hard to sell that. it's hard to sell anything in today's market. ""it's not like the team is ***recession**-proof - cass said hospitality tent sales have fallen off in the latter half of the season as the weather turned cold and companies tightened their year-end budgets. sponsorship revenue is also flat, according to cass. but for this year - one of the worst many companies have seen - he said they'll take it.and, cass noted, ravens owner steve bisciotti isn't in this to make a profit - he's in it to break even and win games.""if he told me 'i want you maximize profits,' we'd run the team very differently,"" cass said. ""we wouldn't spend as much on players, we wouldn't spend as much on our facility, we wouldn't have as large as a scouting staff and we'd certainly have a much smaller coaching staff.

""i always like to say to our league we are blacked out in our own market even though our games are sold out. ""for a team that arrived here less than 14 years ago, growing its fan base is still a top priority. and, cass said, baltimore is at a disadvantage to some other teams because it's bordered by pennsylvania's two nfl teams to the north and the redskins to the south. cass said he thinks the ravens spend more on marketing than most teams because they don't have a designated secondary market (like northern virginia for the redskins) and have to protect what it has.when games are blacked out in cities like laurel, just 14 miles from the stadium, that makes it more difficult.cass said there are certain areas - anne arundel, harford, prince george's, montgomery and frederick counties - that could share the ravens and redskins. companies like verizon wireless that sponsor both teams should be able to use both ravens and redskins marks and logos in those counties instead of being forced to use the designated home team's, he said.going head-to-head""they might market us in parts of montgomery and [prince george's] county, and i could see them marketing the redskins in parts of anne arundel and howard counties, as well as frederick county,"" cass said. ""we would welcome the opportunity to go head-to-head. ""eliminating the television scheduling conflicts would be a little harder, but cass pointed to other dual-market areas, like the san francisco bay area and new york city, that make it work with two nfl teams to broadcast.to make that happen, the ravens would have to first get the cooperation of the redskins, then the nfl. but cass said he believes it's possible.""we're more than happy to have them come into our market if we can go into their market,"" he said.for the more immediate future, the ravens are preparing for a non-salary-capped season in 2010. under the existing collective bargaining agreement, which expires after the 2010 season, the 2009 season is the last year of the cap. talks between the nfl owners and players union are under way, but if a new agreement is not reached by march, the salary cap system will not be in place for next season.the salary cap, which increases yearly according to a formula outlined in the existing collective bargaining agreement, is about $127 million per team for the 2009 season.cass declined to talk about the negotiations, but said he is confident the players and owners will reach an agreement by the time the current one expires. if there's an uncapped season next year, he said the team plans to set a cash budget and stick to it.no spending free-for-allbut an uncapped season isn't going to be the spending free-for-all that some fans may by expecting, cass said. an uncapped season will limit the number of unrestricted free agents - players whose contracts have expired and can sign with another franchise - and teams' off-season moves next year may be minimal.under the current collective bargaining agreement, in the event of an uncapped season, the number of seasons required to become an unrestricted free agent goes from four to six. so, players who were drafted in 2006 and were expecting to sell their services for top dollar next year (including ravens defensive lineman haloti ngata and new orleans saints running back reggie bush), would have to sit tight.all that's nice if a team wants to easily re-sign a player - but not so nice if teams were hoping to make some big moves before the 2010 season. although cass wouldn't exactly say how the ravens plan to deal with that market, he said they are ready.""neither the owners nor the union wanted to get into an uncapped year,"" he said. ""there are good things and bad things about it ... but we have a plan and we'll stick to that plan. """,12/23/09,1,1,1,,,1

were outnumbered 160 to 10. for two of those years, the senate split was 49 to 1. it was the gop's lowest numbers in modern times.but the balance changed in the 1980 presidential election when republicans across the country rode the coattails of ronald reagan as he charged into the white house. gop seats in the n.c. general assembly grew to 34 that year. after reagan's landslide re-election in 1984, the general assembly had 50 gop members.the coattails effect -- when races lower on the ballot go the same way as those at the top -- could play a role in this year's general assembly races, but it might not be the typical role, political observers say. and each party is hoping to be able to grab some coattails.north carolina democrats hope to ride barack obama, but they are staying away from his campaign for a change in leadership. the incumbent governor is a democrat; the lieutenant governor running for governor is a democrat, and democrats hold majorities of 31-19 in the state senate and 68-52 in the state house.\""we want change, but the change we want is help from the federal government,\"" said state senate majority leader tony rand, a fayetteville democrat. \""you always want to improve and do things better, and we're always working in economic development and education. i don't know that you'd want to change that.\""republicans also are seeking momentum from higher up the ticket -- but more from a gubernatorial candidate than their nominee for president. they're looking for a boost to win a house seat in fayetteville and hold onto another one in moore county.this year features contested races for 99 seats in the general assembly -- 30 of the 50 total in the senate and 69 of 120 in the house. among the senate races, five are open seats, where the incumbent is not running. in the house, 13 seats are open.coattails trends have been fairly consistent in recent north carolina legislative elections. in six of the past nine presidential elections, the party that won the white house also gained seats in the general assembly. twice, there were no changes.the only time since 1972 that the winning president's party lost seats in the legislature was in 2004, when president bush was re-elected but the gop lost five assembly seats.the two times that a presidential election had no effect on the legislature's party split were in 1976 and 1992 -- when a democrat took the white house after eight or more years of a republican presidency.obama is hoping to seize the white house after eight years of bush, and he is leading both state and national polls based largely on his campaign for change. but north carolina democrats are trying to align themselves more with obama's plans to pull out of an ***economic crisis**.\""it's not just about change,\"" said kerra bolton, spokeswoman for the n.c. democratic party. \""you can't just throw out the word change, and that's supposed to mean something. it's also about the economy. democrats have an excellent record on creating jobs and economic growth, and democrats are turning out in droves to vote, in part because of senator obama's record on the economy.\""bolton said obama's potential to help democrats win general assembly seats will come from his popularity. according to an aggregate of polls by realclearpolitics.com, obama has a seven-point lead over john mccain nationally, and state polls have him leading by five to seven percentage points.\""senator obama has definitely helped with turnout, and that makes seats that we would likely have had to protect safe and has allowed us to go after more seats,\"" bolton said. she declined to say which senate or house seats are considered safe or in jeopardy.rand also agreed that state democrats could benefit from obama's energy.\""the number of newly registered voters is amazing,\"" rand said. \""i don't know if it's coattails or enthusiasm or excitement or what, but all those bode well for us, i think.\""north carolina republicans are counting on gubernatorial candidate pat mccrory, who is co-opting obama's call for change and spinning it against the democratic nominee, lt. gov. bev perdue. she has spent the past 21 years either in the state legislature or as lieutenant governor.\""i think that works in our favor,\"" state gop spokesman brent woodcox said. \""i think people understand that democrats have been in control of the general assembly, and if you look at the change concept, you look at incumbents.\""house minority leader paul stam, a wake county republican, noted that the presidential candidates are on a separate part of the ballot. a straight-party vote requires a vote for president, then a vote for other candidates of the same party.\""we certainly won't see any coattail effects from that,\"" stam said. \""mccrory is running a close race. that's where we would see some coattail effects.\""woodcox said mccrory is having better poll results than mccain or the other gop notable on the ballot: u.s. sen. elizabeth dole.dole trailed her challenger, democratic state sen. kay hagan, in polls last week.\""it's interesting, at least in the house. house candidates in our polling track more with mccrory than dole or mccain,\"" woodcox said. \""pat is polling the best of them all.\""he said the gop is looking to make inroads in seven districts, including district 44, held by democrat margaret dickson of fayetteville.\""this is a very competitive election environment, and we're not taking anything for granted,\"" woodcox said. \""but we have seven top-tier targets, all challengers, that we feel pretty good about.\""one of those is dickson's opponent, retired u.s. army col. lou huddleston.\""we're pretty excited. he's made some inroads in that district. that's a very winnable seat,\"" woodcox said.rand said he does not like huddleston's chances of defeating dickson, suggesting that such a notion is political rhetoric.\""any of them are winnable, but i don't think he will win,\"" rand said.woodcox said funeral director jamie boles is among a handful of safe candidates. boles is running against democrat betty mangum for the district 53 seat representing moore county. while it is an open seat, it has been one of the house's strongest republican districts, held by former rep. richard morgan for 16 years and joe boylan the past two years.stam agreed, saying,

4SPT-VJH0-TX2J-211S-00000-00.txt,"not long ago, investors hailed vietnam as a dynamic, export-driven ""china-killer."" but in recent months, it has moved ahead of its giant neighbor for a less laudable reason: it's the asian economy most likely to crash in 2008. with suddenness only the world's fastest-growing region can deliver, vietnam's economy has lurched off course. its main stock exchange has plunged 55 percent this year, inflation topped 25 percent in may, wage protests are erupting at scores of factories and the national budget is cracking under the weight of imported energy. in may, ratings agencies standard &amp; poor's and fitch lowered vietnam's credit rating on fears of financial instability. morgan stanley warned of a possible ""devaluation episode"" centered on its embattled currency, the dong, cautioning that such a development ""could trigger a contagion throughout the region"" similar to the 1997-98 asian ***financial crisis**.vietnam may turn out to be the canary in asia's coal mine. like the rest of the region, its economy is export-driven, energy-dependent and labor-intensive. the formula worked well as long as energy remained cheap and american consumption steamed ahead. but as western consumers spend less, and rising oil and food prices lead to double-digit inflation throughout the region, the economic tables have turned. the burgeoning middle class that was supposed to create self-sustaining growth for asia and help buoy the world in a global downturn looks beleaguered, and the poor are becoming desperate.imported oil has outraced export earnings, staining the national trade balance red. meanwhile, leaders in hanoi and elsewhere have proved themselves unable to raise interest rates, tighten the money supply or adjust its dollar-pegged currency sufficiently to avert an inflation-induced meltdown. ""they panicked,"" says william james, a senior economist at the asian development bank in manila, referring to the vietnamese government's imposition of a rice-export ban and various domestic price controls this year. he adds: ""[vietnam] is a real ground zero for what's going to happen with inflation"" in asia.from seoul to jakarta to islamabad, policymakers are making the same missteps. faced with their toughest economic challenge in a decade--surging inflation--governments have yet to embrace the proven macroeconomic-policy response: aggressive monetary tightening. instead, they favor stopgap administrative measures like price caps, based on the flawed logic that today's price surge is temporary, so overreacting to it could undermine economic growth that (truth be told) is already weakening, thanks to declining western consumption and deteriorating terms of trade. the problem, argues sailesh jha, an economist at barclays capital in singapore, is that inflationary momentum is stronger than it's been in nearly two decades in asia, and likely to rise--not stabilize--well into 2009. ""asia's central bankers are sitting on the fence when they should be reining in inflation,"" he says. ""that's the same fundamental mistake the americans made in the 1970s.""that historic blunder added the terrifying word ""stagflation"" to the modern economic lexicon. it means slow growth coupled with persistent price rises, evidence of which is already appearing in asia's economic data. in industrial powerhouse south korea, for example, the official inflation rate stands at 4.9 percent, but national income is growing by 1.3 percent. thailand's consumer price index has tripled over the last year and indonesia's has doubled despite slower real growth in both nations. inflation in china and india is approaching 10 percent, even as both economies are slowing: china from 11.9 to 10 percent and india from 9 to 8 percent.the juxtaposition may not seem alarming yet--but economists agree that official figures in asia understate inflation and overstate growth significantly, creating the false impression that asia is maintaining high growth while keeping prices in check. in april, former reserve bank of india deputy governor s. s. tarapore noted that the indices used in his country (as well as in many other parts of the region) ""greatly underestimate the extent of inflation.""that's a dangerous illusion. historically, policy dithering as inflationary spirals build has magnified the havoc they ultimately wreak. unless tackled quickly, price spikes in commodities lead to demands for higher wages which push up the general price levels, particularly in fast-growing economies. central banks can head off such a spiral by moving early to tighten money supply through higher interest rates. but real interest rates in asia are still low or even negative, while bank lending is up sharply thus far in '08. daniel melser, a senior economist at moody'seconomy.com in sydney, says the focus of asian central-bank policy is designed to ""suit exporters.""despite this effort, the export boom is slowing. while china's exports officially rose 21.4 percent in the first quarter of 2008 to $306 billion, the problem with that number is that china, like much of asia, tallies its exports in fast-depreciating u.s. dollars. measured in euros or yen (the coinage of beijing's largest and third largest trading partners respectively), china's exports ticked up just 4 percent during the first quarter of 2008. hardly a global economy-saving performance.the real trade story is surging imports--much of it $130-per-barrel crude--into asia. last week lehman brothers said china's trade surplus peaked in the first quarter, and that, excluding china and japan, the rest of asia is already running a trade deficit, thanks to a ""ballooning import bill"" for food and fuel, much of it subsidized by government (at least for now). so far in 2008, vietnam has already spent $38 billion on imports, more than it did in all of 2007, tripling its trade deficit.when those subsidies are cut, as they undoubtedly will be, the rest of the world will begin to feel asia's inflationary pain in the form of rising prices on consumer goods. the fast-growing economies that were supposed to help prop up the rest of the world would instead pull it down. unless food and oil prices come down sharply, a number of asian economies including indonesia and the philippines could see growth forecasts slashed by 4 to 5 percent, according to the adb's james. ""the answer,"" he says, ""is for governments to accept slower growth in the short run and control inflation."" that would hammer exporters, and slow job creation. still, ""inflation is more likely to cause riots than joblessness,"" says felipe medalla, former head of the national economic and development authority in the philippines. ""people blame the government for higher prices, but when they get laid off they blame their bosses."" if stagflation takes root in asia, there will be plenty of blame to go around.",6/16/08,0,0,1,,,0

at the lucrative wages and benefits the job offered.at the time, annual growth in cargo volumes moved through long beach and los angeles had increased nearly 300 percent from 1997 to 2007, and the future seemed primed for more of the same.ships arrived daily packed with goods, trucking companies worked around the clock -- clogging local roadways in the meantime -- rail operators moved record volumes.in short, record profits and unending growth seemed inevitable as the global economy boomed.but then came the great financial meltdown of 2008, sending shockwaves through the global economy and devastating the once-powerful economic engine that is the ports of long beach and los angeles.by september, cargo volumes through san pedro bay had dropped nearly 20 percent since their 2007 peak, leaving longshoremen, truckers, warehouse workers and others underemployed or out-of-work.and despite predictions to the contrary, a turnaround doesn't seem likely anytime soon.\""it's been one of the

workers moving on to less lucrative careers or leaving for states and regions with more opportunities.meanwhile, major global shipping companies have severely curtailed expenditures, shutting local offices, consolidating operations and laying off workers as they scramble to cope with declining revenues.in late september, shipping company american presidents line shuttered its longtime oakland offices and moved its operations to arizona in an effort to shave $200 million in expenses, while orient overseas container line closed its west coast headquarters in san ramon and relocated to asia.other companies with offices in long beach and san pedro, including horizon lines, have been forced to curtail their work forces as well. horizon earlier this year laid off 10 percent of its work

with many vessels simply anchored at deep-water ports in asia awaiting better days, said paul bingham, an economist at ihs global insight.\""collectively, these companies have lost billions in the past year or so, and some have even been forced to ask for government bailouts, which they receive because of their importance to their respective countries' economies,\"" bingham said. \""that's unprecedented and it shows the very dramatic steps these companies have taken to cope with the downturn.\""the situation among global shippers has grown so dire that a few have even been forced into bankruptcy, including an iranian container ship company that found itself unable to pay for three korean-built ships it had ordered when the economy was booming.the persian firm, unable to meet its

4VC3-4JX0-TX12-N0Y5-00000-00.txt,"c(""jan. 12--local universities, which have seen funding in their endowments drop because of the slumping economy, are realizing that they can still count on alumni to sustain them during these difficult times.at least for now.officials at the college of william and mary, as well as christopher newport and hampton universities, say alumni giving has remained steady so far this fiscal year, despite being in a ***recession**. some are even boasting of increases in alumni gifts in the first six months of this fiscal year, which began july 1, compared with the same time last fiscal year.this isn't surprising to william and mary vice president for development sean pieri, who said americans had a strong history of giving money to their alma maters.\""the number one place americans give their money is to their church, second is to their university and third is to other charitable organizations,\"" pieri said.in fiscal 2008, william and mary raised $35.4 million, but in just the first six months of this fiscal year, the university has raised more than $30 million, pieri said.this year's fundraising includes a $6 million donation that the university received in december from former student and new york developer sherman cohen and his wife, gloria. the money will be used to finance the university's $7.9 million career center.it also includes a $2.5 million gift that william and mary graduate and norfolk resident elizabeth \""bee\"" mcleod and her husband, j. goodenow \""goody\"" tyler iii, gave to the university's library and business school in october.in addition, the university raised $10.7 million -- $700,000 more than projected -- for the gateway william and mary endowed fund, which provides supplemental financial assistance to low-income university students.pieri said these large gifts were result of months of work.\""large gifts take time. they don't happen overnight,\"" pieri said. \""it's challenging for everyone out there right now. we are just benefiting from our work over the past 18 months.\""in light of the economy, organizations that rely on charitable donations, such as nonprofits, have seen declines in the number and amount of contributions they receive. but university officials are finding that alumni want to give -- even if it's less than their usual gifts.christopher newport vice president of advancement elizabeth taraski said she had seen people who normally gave $50 to university cut back to $25 this fiscal year, while others continue to donate $25,000 and $50,000.\""there may be an individual who is still donating but at a lower level and other people whose financial situation hasn't taken a hit by the economy,\"" taraski said. those people continue to donate to the university.\""we've received a couple of major gifts that were just delightful to get, considering the economy,\"" said taraski, who's working to meet christopher newport's $9.1 million fundraising goal for fiscal 2009.on thursday, taraski said she was still totaling donations that the university received from over the christmas break. she said december was always a busy time for her department as alumni raced to get in donations so they could deduct the gift from their taxes.taraski said she had also seen a lot more envelopes coming in since november, when the university kicked off its $3 million fundraising campaign to build an alumni house on campus. she said the university had raised $250,000 so far.hampton university vice president for development harriet f. davis said reaching out to alumni through the internet had been helpful in maintaining alumni giving. hampton is reaching out to its graduates through e-newsletters and by allowing them to make donations online.\""we had a resounding response from alumni to support the band's trip to the inauguration,\"" davis said. \""a lot of them donated online.\""william and mary's pieri said that even though this fiscal year was good, he worried about next year.\""i sleep fine thinking about fiscal year 2009, but next year has me losing sleep,\"" pieri said. \""instead of saying, 'how much can i donate,' a lot of people are saying, 'let's wait and see.' we're going to see it flatten out over the next six months.\""he said some alumni had said the stocks that they used to donate had taken a hit because of the economy.cnu's taraski and hu's davis, however, remained optimistic. \""we'll survive,\"" taraski said.pieri agreed but thought that college fundraisers were going to have to get back to building relationships and meeting people in person.\""if you hunker down like an ostrich in the sand, things aren't going to change,\"" he said. \""we've got to get out there and use some shoe leather and build contacts.\""to see more of the daily press, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.dailypress.com. copyright (c) 2009, daily press, newport news, va. distributed by mcclatchy-tribune

4RTC-8TG0-TX12-N0TJ-00000-00.txt,"c(""feb. 10--i don't know about you, but i'm ready to be stimulated.back in december the living room television began experiencing problems -- a little wavy band at the top of the screen. soon it got worse and eventually the band thickened to take up nearly the top fourth of the screen. the only huge inconvenience was the scoreboard and clock that runs at the top of the screen during football games.we hated to replace the tv, especially since it was only about three years old, so we toughed it out and figured we'd replace it sometime in 2008.when president bush announced the economy had him worried last month and he intended to ask for an economic stimulus package, visions of a new high definition lcd television began to dance in our heads. we began looking over the deals and researching the brands.when the democrats tried adding a little extra into the bill and the republicans blocked it we suddenly felt very unstimulated.now that we have a bill and a promise from the president to sign it, we're starting to shop again.it seems a little silly that we hand our money over to the government then feel like they've blessed us with a wonderful gift when they give a little bit of it back. sure i know the economists have all been telling us we're headed into a ***recession**, but it smells a lot more to me like we're headed into an election year.assuming you paid income tax last year, and didn't make over $75,0000 individually or $150,000 as a couple, you can expect $600 or $1,200 for a couple.my shopping research reveals that amount should buy a 42-inch lcd hdtv set with 1080i resolution, whatever all that code means.my dilemma here is this -- apparently most, if not all, televisions these days are built outside the country, so i'm worried that i might not be applying full stimulation to the economy.maybe i should just eat steak at a nice restaurant twice a day until the money's gone. beef is mostly domestic and a good tip to the waitstaff would certainly be a stimulus.i could put it into a project around the house, but i'm too busy to do the work myself and there's not enough there to hire it done.i could take a trip, but that would require taking time off from the job and buying gasoline that is imported.no, what i really need is a television. i just won't tell the president that i probably would have been forced to purchase one anyway and would have had to take it out of savings.it would be nice to give the government a little bit less and all of us to learn to save until we have enough for a new television or a new car. instead, too many people have fallen prey to the easy availability of credit.credit cards are maxed out in households across the country. people have used home equity to take vacations or to pay those high interest credit cards off just to survive. mortgage companies got sloppy looking for higher and higher numbers and we have something called a sub-prime lending crisis escorting us into this possible ***recession**.we've gotten ourselves into a real mess and finally the politicians have recognized that if they don't show the proper concern for the struggling middle class the whole lot of congress could be out on their backsides.i say while we've got their attention, let's not stop with stimulating the economy. let's use this heated political season as an opportunity to draw attention to our real plight -- it's darn tough to afford a television as big as you would like.karl terry is managing editor at the portales news-tribune. contact him at 356-4481, ext. 33 or e-mail:karl_terry@link.freedom.comto see more of the portales news-tribune or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.pntonline.com/. copyright (c) 2008, the portales news-tribune, n.m. distributed by mcclatchy-tribune information services. for reprints, email tmsreprints@permissionsgroup.com, call 800-374-7985 or 847-635-6550, send a fax to 847-635-6968, or write to the permissions group inc., 1247 milwaukee ave., suite 303, glenview, il 60025, usa."",

""maybe there will be a story there in a couple months' time, when the picture is clearer, but right now the financial climate has been changing dramatically every 24 hours, if not more, so what it will look like in three months' time could be very, very different.""still, getting someone like wall street journal veteran roger lowenstein or star new york times business reporter andrew ross sorkin-both of whom are considering writing books about the crisis-right now means a chance at being first out the door. moreover, getting them now means no one else will be able to get them later.""there's a lot to be said for a timely book, but we don't know what the book is yet,"" said simon &amp; schuster publisher david rosenthal, noting that there are nevertheless writers out there whom he would agree to publish immediately just because he knows they'd do a good job with whatever ends up happening.at any rate, proposals have started making the rounds.one comes from times business columnist joe nocera and fortune's bethany mclean, who decided to write a book together the day lehman brothersdeclared bankruptcy and merrill lynch sold itself to bank of america. mr. nocera was visiting ms. mclean (co-writer of the enron book the smartest guys in the room) in chicago at the time-he was there to attend a science conference, what kind he wouldn't say-and over some white wine, the two of them decided that a definitive chronicle of the stunning ***financial crisis** was in order, and that they were the team best equipped to produce it.""we want to write the big book, and i'm not afraid of saying that,"" mr. nocera said. ""it will be a book for the ages and-i know this is going to sound egomaniacal, but-between our contacts and our reporting skills and our writing skills, i think we'll be pretty tough to beat.""the agency representing the nocera-mclean book to publishers, darhansoff, verrill and feldman is said to be asking more than $1 million (no one there picked up the phone when pub crawl sought comment).sloan harris, co-director of icm's literary department, is preparing to circulate a proposal for a quickie electronic book by newsweek's daniel gross that would be published before the end of the year (with a possible print edition to follow).""my idea was to try to get a book out immediately-not immediately for immediately's sake, but rather to fill the void between daily and weekly journalism and the big door-stopper books that will be published a year or two from now,"" mr. harris said. he ventured further that readers have nowhere to turn for a thorough explanation of what is happening to the economy and how it got that way.""i don't think readers can get a unified view by reading 30 articles,"" mr. harris said. ""and because this is unbelievably immediate, the story changes every day, and it sticks its fingers right down into those things that we care most about. i assume there's a real hunger for a comprehensive understanding of it, which is not well sated by having to wait six months for a book.""the trouble is, no one has any idea when the dust from wall street is going to settle, so deciding how to proceed when, say, the nocera-mclean proposal lands on one's desk isn't wholly obvious. when john mccain chose sarah palin as his running mate on aug. 29, most publishers elected to wait because there was not enough time before the election to do a proper biography, and too great a risk that ms. palin would disappear after nov. 4. the fog had an expiration date, in other words.with the ***financial crisis**, publishers have no idea how long their competitors will wait, and thus might be tempted to lunge for whatever they're offered now to avoid getting shut out later.""you sign up a writer; you don't necessarily sign up a proposal,"" said will weisser, associate publisher of penguin's business imprint portfolio (no relation to the magazine). ""you find a good writer and say, 'o.k., follow the story where it goes.'""he went on: ""there are basically two strategies. ... you either rush to get the first one and hope to capitalize that way, or you hold your fire and you do something that's really great. you can try to do the super-crash and ride the wave of national attention, or you can try to find somebody who's a good enough journalist who can adapt a book to the changing circumstances.""adapting, incidentally, is what a lot of publishers are doing right now, as they review books they signed up many months ago, when the subprime ***mortgage crisis** was only just breaking into the public consciousness and the collapse of bear stearns seemed like a climax rather than the foothill it has proven to be. portfolio has a bear stearns book under contract from wall street journal reporter (and observer alumna) kate kelly. according to mr. weisser, its structure will remain intact. but charles gasparino's forthcoming book, the sellout: how wall street greed and stupidity destroyed america's dominance of the global financial system, which collins business acquired about a week after the bear stearns meltdown, is likely to require some re-jiggering, as will the book that financial times' global markets editor gillian tett is writing for free press. ms. tett said in an e-mail that her book (which was originally going to focus on jpmorgan) ""is being expanded in light of current events."" and the journal's david wessel, who signed on to do a book on the fed and the treasury for crown after the bear collapse, said he has been ""re-framing the book as events unfold.""some publishers, meanwhile-the ones that have general finance books coming out in the next few months-are rejoicing at their prescience and good fortune. among them are penguin press, which will publish charles ellis' history of goldman sachs next month, and norton, which has michael lewis' panic: the story of modern financial insanity coming out in december.lneyfakh@observer.com",9/23/08,1,1,1,,,1

break out. last time the party won power, moderate deficit hawks and liberal neo-keynesians immediately set out to wage a war for the soul of the clinton presidency. things got pretty vicious. there were no reported cases of knife wounds or tire-iron beatings, but furious memos exchanged hands, bitter memoirs were written by the losers, and medium-grade warfare simmered throughout the remainder of the decade at think tanks and magazines.this time around, it's as if they gave a war for the soul of the obama presidency and nobody came. deficit hawks and deficit doves are living together in perfect harmony. a few weeks ago, longtime ideological adversaries jared bernstein, from the prototypically liberal economic policy institute, and wall street darling robert rubin actually authored a joint op-ed arguing that the liberal-moderate split no longer mattered. \""[h]ow real are these differences?\"" they wrote, poignantly if not poetically. \""our view--and we come from pretty different analytical perspectives--is that in many important ways, they are false, and serve as more of a distraction than a map.\"" can you feel the love?oh, sure, complaints and jockeying for influence have not disappeared altogether, but what little of it there is has the feel of going through the motions. the striking thing is that liberals and centrists have come to almost total agreement on the democratic economic program. how did it happen?first, as i wrote in these pages two years ago, the nature of the economy during the last eight years forced centrists to rethink their premises (see \""freakoutonomics,\"" november 6, 2006). after 1973, the main problem of the u.s. economy was that it didn't grow fast enough to create rising living standards. during the 1990s, centrists believed that reducing the budget deficit would hold down interest rates and allow greater business investment, leading to higher productivity and, eventually, rising wages across the board. that's exactly what happened, though you can debate the degree to which clinton's policies contributed.during the bush years, the economy also grew--not as fast as during the clinton years, but fast enough. the problem was that the gains from that growth were radically maldistributed. where the clinton years saw rising wages for even the poorest workers, the bush years had stagnant wages for all but the very rich, who reaped spectacular gains. you can, again, debate how much bush's policies contributed, but the fact was that economic growth was no longer by itself sufficient to bring about rising living standards for most americans. this made centrists more inclined to support policies that would divide the pie more evenly (like making union organizing easier) and more reluctant to support policies that would increase inequality (like new free trade pacts).second, the current ***recession** has done even more to bury the fiscal conservatism of the clinton years. at the outset of the clinton administration, liberals argued for economic stimulus to spark the economy. moderates countered that the economy had already pulled out of ***recession** and that it required a smaller deficit to pick up its long-term growth rate. when the economy did grow, and the budget deficit shriveled, moderates further advocated paying down the national debt rather than spending the surplus on social programs and tax cuts.liberals accused the administration of proposing (as robert kuttner put it at the time) \""permanent surplus.\"" but permanent surplus was never the idea. clintonites thought they should pay down the debt when the economy boomed so that they could have more room to run it up when the economy eventually went bust. as lawrence summers, one of clinton's centrist treasury secretaries, put it in 1999, \""now is the time to reload the fiscal cannon.\"" today, summers and the rest of the clintonites agree that now is the time to fire that cannon.of course, you'd expect that, when the economy returns to health, the old battle lines will form again, as moderates argue for deficit reduction while liberals resist. and probably some fissures will reappear over how much deficit to allow. but the centrists won't return to the same pay-down-the-debt stance they took during the clinton years, because--this is reason number three, if you're counting--they've figured out that the bush administration played them for fools.the moderates still believe that paying down the national debt made economic sense in the 1990s. unfortunately, doing so failed to account for the political reality that the republican party had absolutely no interest in fiscal responsibility. all that clintonian thriftiness did was leave a bigger surplus for george w. bush to devote to tax cuts. bush portrayed the very fact that the government was paying down its debt as an \""overcharge\"" of the taxpayer. (\""a surplus,\"" he said, \""means the government has more money than it needs.\"")democratic moderates still favor fiscal responsibility in theory, but they realize that unilateral fiscal responsibility is a sucker's game. democrats under clinton had to defer their own goals and take all the political heat (which they did, by passing a deficit-reduction bill with zero gop votes in 1993). then, when the republicans got into office, they imposed their priorities on the government without worrying about the cost. it's a form of moral hazard: republicans can make as big a mess as they want out of the federal budget, because they know democrats will be there to volunteer for the clean-up committee. and they have every incentive to continue acting this way until democrats stop cooperating.recently, republican economists greg mankiw and lawrence lindsey urged obama to rein in spending so that deficits don't depress long-term growth. such touching concern for the children of tomorrow was absent when they were cheering on bush's wild tax-cutting binges. i think most democratic fiscal centrists responded to these entreaties the same way i did: how about we enact health care reform and education reform, and then we can figure out how to tame the deficit?republicans have expressed surprise and joy that the obama economic team is laced with moderates, not traditional liberals. what they haven't figured out yet is that the difference amounts to very little.""

hardly showed.the team's owner was asked yesterday, as part of a joint interview with president frank coonelly at seven springs mountain resort on the opening day of the promotional winter caravan, how much of a priority it will be to have success in 2009 given that the franchise's clear focus is on the more distant future. and he responded with what might have been his strongest statement since taking control of ownership, two years ago to the day.\""there's no question that my expectation in 2009 is that we have a better team than we did last year,\"" he said. \""even as we continue to build for the long-term success of the franchise, a real, championship-caliber organization that can compete on a sustainable basis, we have tohave a better team in 2009 and better than what pittsburgh has seen lately.\""the pirates finished 67-95 last season, the 16th losing record in a row. \""it could be the pitching coach,\"" nutting continued, referring to newcomer joe kerrigan. \""it could be the expectations we have for conditioning. i think that's a real fundamental change that's going to give our players -- the young players who we're going to give a chance to play -- a better opportunity to succeed than they've had in the past. that's cultural, and that's attitude, but i really believe that it can have an impact. and, from my standpoint, i need to set the bar high enough that the entire organization knows that the expectation is to improve in 2009, not only in 2010 or 2011.\""nutting was asked to define his view of improvement, if that meant that a worse record would be acceptable even if certain individuals -- such as nate mclouth, ryan doumit and paul maholm -- were to blossom and brighten the long-term future.\""no,\"" he replied. \""that would be a very disappointing year. as an organization, we have to continue to hold people accountable for improvement on the field at the major league level, as well as organization-wide. you saw it last year with matt morris. we're not going to accept an inferior performance.\""the pirates bought out the remainder of morris' $10.04 million salary in april after he struggled immensely. morris was acquired by former general manager dave littlefield in a trade the previous summer, with nutting's approval.the accountability must extend to the top, for any sports franchise, and nutting and coonelly repeatedly have stated that they are no exceptions. it surely is worth noting, then, that the pirates again will have one of major league baseball's lowest payrolls, with a ceiling in the range of $54 million, and have made only one noteworthy acquisition this offseason with the free-agent signing of 32-year-old utility infielder ramon vazquez.to that end, nutting and coonelly each stressed that the pirates will not veer off course of their oft-stated plan to build a formidable minor-league system with an aim of competing perennially.and this year, as each acknowledged, that will include giving some younger or less experienced players such as third baseman andy laroche and outfielder nyjer morgan a chance to have regular duty to see what they have for the future.\""we're not going to block the opportunity for bright, young players,\"" nutting said. \""we've been criticized for that in the past, where you bring someone in and block a freddy sanchez.\""that was a reference to littlefield signing veteran free agent joe randa in 2006 and using him instead of sanchez early in the same season that sanchez wound up winning the national league batting title. \""we have to continue on the plan we have,\"" nutting said. \""we're moving in a very solid direction. but i'm in no way willing to say that doesn't mean we should get better in 2009.\""\""while we certainly have developed a scouting-development-centric plan, the most important game we play every night in our organization is in pittsburgh,\"" coonelly said. \""we really believe that we're in much better shape going into this year with our starting pitching, which was our achilles' heel last year, now that we have joe kerrigan. and what makes 2009 exciting for me is seeing what these players we added in the deadline deals can do.\""that includes laroche, he added, even though laroche batted .152 with three home runs in the two months after being acquired in the july 31 jason bay trade.\""in andy's case, especially, with a lingering thumb injury that i think was worse than what he let on, to judge him on those two months doesn't make sense,\"" coonelly said. \""you look at his time in the minor leagues, and this was an extraordinarily highly regarded prospect.\""laroche, one of six players meeting fans on the caravan this week, said the torn thumb ligament he sustained in spring training with the los angeles dodgers is fully healed.as for the pirates' payroll, nutting and coonelly each spoke with pride that their ceiling will remain precisely where they set it late last summer, even as other teams in the majors are cutting -- some drastically -- in the face of the national ***economic crisis**.\""we're taking a hard look at all of our expenses but, in terms of the major league payroll? we budgeted conservatively, a number we knew we could appropriately handle with our revenues, and we'll probably be right around where we said,\"" coonelly said.a $54 million payroll would represent $3 million more than was spent last season.\""i think we're uniquely positioned to handle the downturn, and i think that's because bob did really terrific work in getting the club in position where we could be on solid financial footing that we didn't have,\"" coonelly said. \""we don't have to hope and pray that we'll exceed budget expectations in order to simply pay the bills. for any club to budget like that in a year like this would be extraordinarily dangerous.\""off the field, the pirates' business appears to be weathering the economy better than that of some teams that recently have described dramatic drops in season tickets and other revenues. coonelly said that season-ticket sales are going roughly as well as they did at the same point last year. the team finished with fewer than 9,000 full-season equivalents for 2008.a large reason, coonelly added, is a sizable discount in season plans, including a $399 full-season seat for the upper outfield decks. that is less than $5 a game, a price not seen since the team moved to pnc park.\""we are tracking very well with last year in terms of renewal rates, but we're also pushing very hard for new season-ticket holders,\"" he said. \""we think things are heading in the right direction.\""part of the push for new buyers is the caravan, which has been shortened from three to two weeks but expanded from 21 stops to an unprecedented 30 across pennsylvania, ohio, maryland and west virginia. the extra mileage is possible because the pirates asked more players to participate and split them into two groups.piratefest, the annual weekend fan event at the david l. lawrence convention center, opens friday.\""the caravan and piratefest give us a chance to show the fans we appreciate their continued support,\"" nutting said. \""i think it makes a huge difference for people to see that we're there to talk to the fans and to share the excitement that we -- and i know i -- have for the 2009 season.\""""

7X63-FBT1-2PKR-S184-00000-00.txt," los angeles ? oprah winfrey's new partner on cable tv is a bit like her: it came from humble beginnings to become a big force in the media business. after launching in 1985 with 156,000 subscribers, discovery communications inc.now has a global audience of millions and owns several hot cable properties, including discovery channeland tlc, home of the tabloid sensation ""jon &amp; kate plus 8."" its stock has more than doubled since the start of the year, and the company's market value is nearly $9 billion. ratings at its most well-known channels are up, thanks in part to the gossip about jon and kate gosselin and their eight children, whose finale aired monday night. winfrey's announcement friday that she was ending her broadcast-syndicated talk show in 2011 capped a long period of speculation that began when she announced the launch of own: the oprah winfrey network, in a 50-50 partnership with discovery in january 2008. it also marked another victory for cable tv, which has drawn advertisers, audiences and talent away from broadcasters abc, nbc, cbs and fox and their tv station affiliates. one strength of cable network owners, such as discovery, is that they generate steady and rising subscription fees from cable and satellite tv providers, which pay to show channels to their subscribers. that has helped cable networks weather the ***economic downturn** far better than broadcasters. own is set to launch in january 2011 in 80 million u.s. homes, replacing discovery health. research firm snl kagan estimates it generates 12 cents per month in fees per subscriber, but that is expected to rise to 17 cents by 2013 after winfrey settles in. the amount winfrey earned in her broadcast contract, in which cbs corp.syndicated her show to stations nationwide, was not revealed. but anthony diclemente, an analyst at barclays capital, said the deal on cable ""can provide higher value."" ""i'm sure she has mixed emotions about leaving broadcast for cable. but if you look at it from an economic point of view, the recurring subscription fee which occurs on cable is very alluring for both oprah and discovery corporate,"" diclemente said. discovery was launched in 1985 by john hendricks, a history buff who saw value in telecasting enlightening documentaries. a group of investors that included media mogul john malone helped get the company off the ground, literally, with its first subscribers getting the feed via satellite. s.i. newhouse jr.'s advance newhouse communications inc., which also had a stake in discovery, helped the company go public in september of last year. both malone and newhouse's company, which is a subsidiary of the one behind the conde nast magazine group, still hold significant stakes. discovery is 33 percent owned by newhouse's group, while malone owns 3 percent. but malone's shares have more voting power, and combined, newhouse and malone have nearly 50 percent voting control of the company on major issues. the new venture fit perfectly for both winfrey and discovery. a couple of years ago, when ceo david zaslav was looking for what to do with discovery health, one of the company's least successful channels, his wife handed him a copy of ""o, the oprah magazine."" he approached winfrey about a partnership. as it happened, she had recently come upon an entry in her diary dated may 24, 1992, when she wrote about her idea for creating her own network. ""david came and really spoke about the vision i'd been having for 15 years,"" she said last year. ""it felt like, 'i can't believe you're saying this.'?"" since taking his position in january 2007, zaslav has made similar changes in the lineup of 13 cable channels discovery has in the u.s. the company turned its discovery times channel into a home for true-crime shows such as ""call 911"" and renamed it investigation discovery in january 2008. discovery home became planet green in june 2008, and discovery kids is due to be relaunched in late 2010 in a partnership with toy maker hasbro inc. there's no doubt that winfrey's average audience, more than 7 million this fall, will be a boost to discovery health, which had an average prime-time audience of just 238,000 in the third quarter. the talk-show powerhouse also will be entering a segment of television that is on the rise. cable's share of the prime-time tv audience has grown from 41 percent in 1999 to 61 percent during the most recent season, according to nielsen co. and that shift has allowed cable networks to take a bigger share of the advertising dollars that get spent on commercials. in 1998, cable accounted for just 24 percent of total television ad spending, according to magna global, a market research firm. by 2008, it was getting 39 percent. next year, barclay's analyst diclemente sees cable coming back stronger as well, with a 5.5 percent rise in ad revenue, while broadcasters are expected to post 4 percent growth. perhaps winfrey herself would count cable's ascendance as one more on the ""yellow brick road of blessings,"" she cited friday in announcing her departure from broadcast tv.

7VJ7-KYX0-Y8TC-S441-00000-00.txt,"for the last couple of centuries, the two main reasons to visit smithfield, a diminutive dublin neighborhood centered around a spacious square northeast of the city center, were to buy a horse at the local equestrian market and to see the red brick distillery where ireland's best-known whiskey, jameson, was made.   the horse market still takes place monthly (though there's talk of finding a new location), but jameson moved most of its operations south to county cork in the 1960s. the neighborhood soon fell into neglect.   but thanks to an urban renewal plan that the city started in 2003, smithfield has slowly been making a comeback. each of the square's 300,000 cobblestones was uprooted, cleaned, polished and put back. tall, contemporary-looking lampposts bloomed on the circumference of the plus-size plaza, and industrial-chic apartment and retail buildings rose on the western side of the square.   ''a lot of people thought smithfield would be an alternative to temple bar,'' said michael t. hough, a bartender at the shabby-chic dice bar (79 queen street; 353-1-633-3936), referring to the once-derelict, now pub-crammed central dublin neighborhood that was transformed into a ''cultural quarter'' more than a decade ago. ''but it hasn't really got there yet.''   in fact, the recent ***economic downturn** hasn't been kind to the neighborhood, as a few local businesses have recently shuttered. but smithfield still has plenty to offer. the distillery, meanwhile, has been rebranded the old jameson distillery (bow street; 353-807-2355; www.jamesonwhiskey.com; admission is 13.50 euros, about $18.20 at $1.35 to the euro) and turned into a museum dedicated to the making of whiskey. hourlong tours are given in six languages.  the legendary light house cinema (blackhall walk, smithfield market; 353-1-879-7601; www.lighthousecinema.ie), one of the city's few indie movie houses, closed down when it lost its center-of-town location in 1996, only to resurface last year in a sleekly designed, award-winning space (with a modish cafe open to anyone).  the maldron hotel (smithfield square; 353-1-485-0900; www.maldronhotels.com; doubles from 59 euros), part of an irish-owned chain, opened up a smithfield branch last fall. the chic property's 92 rooms offer free high-speed internet access, floor-to-ceiling glass windows, balconies and, in some rooms, great views of the square. stir, the hotel's retro-chic restaurant and bar, serves decent globally inspired dishes like cumin-infused chicken strips and peking duck.   a better dining bet is peppe (31 north brunswick street; 353-1-671-8216; www.pepperestaurant.ie), a southern-italian-leaning eatery serving thick-crust pizzas (9.50 to 13.80 euros) and hearty pasta dishes (10.90 to 13.90 euros).   cristophe's cafe (duck lane; 353-1-887-4417; www.christophescafe.com), by day a casual spot for salads and sandwiches (5 to 10 euros), in the evening turns into a candlelit french bistro offering classics like ribeye steak in a red wine sauce (25 euros) and veal stew in a cream sauce (19.50 euros).   any visit to smithfield isn't complete without stopping by the cobblestone(77 king street north; 353-1-872-1799; www.cobblestonedublin.com). there's been some sort of drinking den in this spot for 150 years, but for the last 15, this popular pub on the north end of the square has become famous for its (sometimes impromptu) irish music sessions. both young and old, smithfield veterans and newcomers turn up for plenty of ''craic'' (gaelic for ''fun'') and a pint or two of the local brew (that would be guinness, of course).   no matter how trendy smithfield becomes, some things, hopefully, will never change.

it boils down to two things, the survey suggests:lots of unemployed and desperate, yet unqualified, people trying to land any job they can, andqualified candidates who are uneasy about leaving the security of their current jobs.with unemployment so common these days, and with more people staying out of work longer, the desperation is setting in, said michael steinitz, robert half international's district president for the carolinas.\""you throw enough darts out there, one of them's going to land. they apply to as many as they can,\"" steinitz said of many job-seekers' mindset, adding that this only creates more work for employers to sort through applications. \""consequently, we're having a lot of clients say that even though they're hiring, the process can be difficult.\""because so many industries have been affected by closings and layoffs, the definition of \""unqualified\"" can mean different things, steinitz said.\""every client we speak to is saying the same thing. they're shocked at the levels of people they're seeing,\"" he said. \""in general, they're being flooded with overqualified, under-qualified and just people who aren't right for the job at all.\""local companies say they can relate to the challenge. york county's unemployment was at 15.2 percent in july, but finding a good candidate to fill a position hasn't gotten any easier.for example, at piedmont medical center in rock hill, the human resources department has seen an increase in applications from people who aren't qualified for the positions they're applying for, spokeswoman sharon harmon said. this includes certificate-level positions such as nursing assistants and billing coding.many people are going back to school to earn certificates in the medical field, but that might not be enough to land a job.\""some are finishing these programs so they have the certificate, but still no experience,\"" harmon said.it's not that lots of people are applying for jobs completely out of their league. the reasons they don't qualify for a job are often subtle.annie reid, director of the rock hill workforce center, said many employers now require multiple certifications to do certain jobs, which poses problems for some work-hungry people.\""a person may be qualified to do one part of a job but not qualified to do another part of the job,\"" she said, adding that she sees this mostly with former textile workers.but to be half-qualified is to be not qualified, reid said. so when this happens, she encourages those people to return to school to get more training and certifications.reid said it's not uncommon in her office to see people who aren't qualified for positions they want, but they aren't allowed to apply for something until they meet the necessary qualifications.\""we normally tell them if they're not qualified,\"" she said. \""we try to refer them to jobs where they are qualified.\""even with these challenges, the time it takes to fill vacancies hasn't changed, according to the employers surveyed, with most reporting an average of 4.5 weeks (for clerical workers) to 14.4 weeks (senior management) depending on the position.so what can a job-seeker take from all this? steinitz offers some advice:don't be a passive job seeker. finding a job is about more than responding to an ad. be aggressive, and learn to network.\""a person can't do enough networking,\"" he said. \""if you rely on just sending out resumes, you'll get grouped with the other 500 people who are just sending in a resume.\""when it does come time to send a resume, sell yourself. show the value you've brought to other companies. have you helped make money, save money?if you're using a recruiter, try to find one who specializes in your industry of choice or your skill set. steinitz also suggests reading industry journals and other publications \""just to see what companies may be experiencing growth.\""employers can learn something from the survey, too.just because unemployment is high, steinitz said, don't think that you won't have to put effort into finding good people. if anything, as the survey suggests, it's going to take work and probably some proactive work on the part of employers.and that applies not just to finding workers but also keeping those already on board.one hiring challenge, cited behind only unqualified applicants, is qualified candidates who already are employed but reluctant to leave the security of their current jobs.this will likely change when the economy turns around, steinitz said, and there's evidence the market uncertainty among workers already is lessening.to that end, 45 percent of workers surveyed in the 2009 edge report said they plan to change jobs when the economy improves.but when it comes to retention, about half of the workers surveyed said higher pay will be the most effective way to keep them from jumping ship.although most companies are still running leaner than usual, it's time for them to start thinking about post-***recession** plans for retaining talent, steinitz said.\""if not,\"" he said, \""people will be looking.\""herald business editor jason foster's \""biz buzz\"" column runs every sunday. contact him at 803-329-4066 or jfoster@heraldonline.com you can follow his business coverage at twitter.com/heraldbizbuzz or on his blog at heraldonline.com/blogs/bizbuzz.to see more of the herald, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.heraldonline.com. copyright (c) 2009, the herald, rock hill, s.c. distributed by mcclatchy-tribune information services. for reprints, email tmsreprints@permissionsgroup.com, call 800-374-7985 or 847-635-6550, send a fax to 847-635-6968, or write to the permissions group inc., 1247 milwaukee ave., suite 303, glenview, il 60025, usa."",

4TMY-WYS0-TW87-N18X-00000-00.txt,"the most stunning graphic of the past few days shows the stock market's reaction to government attempts to rescue the financial system. between monday and wednesday, the federal reserve unveiled five initiatives to unfreeze credit, and stocks slumped after each announcement. meanwhile, in europe, the story is the same: the series of deposit guarantees, bank rescues, partial bank nationalizations and interest rate cuts has yet to calm investors. to the contrary, market panic and apparent government panic have fed on each other. in washington, the treasury went from ad hoc bailouts to demanding $700 billion without saying how it would be spent. in europe, rival governments tripped over themselves as they rolled out uncoordinated measures.there is a silver lining, and a cautionary message, to this terrible week. the silver lining is that market panic has now overshot so much that there's at least a chance that it will subside. we have gone from grappling with genuine financial challenges -- that mortgage loans are tumbling in value; that shrinking the excess borrowing in the financial system is bound to force asset prices down -- to grappling with the exaggerated terror that nobody is to be trusted. banks won't lend to each other or to healthy companies even for short periods. companies that have pre-negotiated rights to borrow are calling in the money, not because they need the cash but because everyone else is hoarding it.central banks, which face fewer political constraints than finance ministries, have rapidly come up with a plan to calm everybody's nerves, though the patient has not yet responded. the fed's version of the policy comes down to this: if bank a won't lend to bank b, let's have bank a lend to us and then we'll lend to bank b; and if banks a and b won't lend to companies c, d and e, then we'll get between them also. in this way, the full faith and credit of the u.s. government can be made to substitute for the lack of faith in private players.the fed's plan is already driving extraordinary growth in its borrowing and lending. this is the most sudden expansion in the state's role in the economy at least since the depression. but the plan is sound. it does not involve printing money or igniting inflation. it shouldn't cost taxpayers much, if anything. once investors see that the fed's approach works in practice as well as in theory, there will be at least some reason for the markets to settle down.here is the cautionary message: if financial professionals are confused by government actions, the voting public is doubly bewildered. as far as most people can see, government is spraying money at the wall street fat cats who created the chaos. federal policy needs to pay more attention to ordinary families, and with the economy tanking and unemployment set to soar, this change had better happen quickly. otherwise, voters will respond to government in the same way that markets have reacted over the past week -- with contemptuous cynicism.how should government demonstrate concern for regular people? john mccain's plan to refinance mortgages shows that he has the right impulse, but this is not the best approach. rearranging home loans one by one would be a slow process when what's needed is quick action. it would be almost impossible to rearrange the loans fairly: prudent home buyers who have kept up with their payments might lose out to imprudent ones who stretched too far; folks who rented while saving for a home would get nothing. besides, mccain's plan could exacerbate the ***financial crisis** in a perverse way. help for families who are behind in their mortgage payments could encourage others to stop paying, too, in which case loans that are now good would quickly turn rotten.the fastest and fairest way to help ordinary people is via a budget stimulus package. part of the extra spending should be distributed to state governments, which are having trouble maintaining medicaid and other programs as ***recession** eats into their tax revenue. part of the extra spending could go to infrastructure projects, though this tends to be a slow way of getting cash into the economy. but much of the stimulus should be in checks made out directly to citizens. wall street is getting its bailout. main street deserves one also.this is not just about politics and fairness. the next stage of this crisis, if financial markets do calm down, will be trouble in the real economy. a new wall street journal poll of economists predicts that u.s. gross domestic product is three months into a contraction that will last until spring -- which implies that the economy is headed for the longest period of shrinkage in more than half a century. there is only so much the fed can do to fight this ***recession**, especially since banks are too bruised to transmit the tonic of low interest rates rapidly through the economy. for reasons both political and economic, therefore, it is time for a budget stimulus.smallaby@cfr.org",10/10/08,1,1,1,,,1

4RJ3-TMG0-TXCG-80VF-00000-00.txt," after besting major u.s. stock indexes early in the year, the richmond index trailed the field when 2007 was said and done, posting a 4.51 percent loss. weighing down the local basket of stocks were the same sectors that performed poorly across the economy as a whole - consumer-goods and financial-services companies. those are two sectors in which the richmond region has a large presence. without a major turnaround in the troubled housing market, the first part of 2008 could produce more of the same for stocks associated with the consumer-goods and financial sectors. some local experts, however, believe the strength in other sectors will keep the economy out of a ***recession** this year. the region's worst performer in 2007 was henrico county-based circuit city stores inc., whose stock price finished the year 77.87 percent below where it started. additionally, genworth financial inc.; carmax inc.; tredegar corp.; udr inc.; media general inc., publisher of the richmond times-dispatch; landamerica financial corp.; and chesapeake corp. saw their stock prices fall more than 25 percent during 2007. the index's leader was massey energy co.of richmond, one of the nation's leading coal producers, whose stock price gained 53.9 percent for the year. the gain reflected an overall rise in energy prices.owens &amp; minor, a hanover-based medical-supply company, was the region's second best performer with a 35.69 percent gain. the company benefited from the acquisition of the mckesson corp.acute-care distribution business. the richmond index's loss for the year compares with a 6.43 percent gain for the dow jones industrial index, a 3.53 percent gain in the standard &amp; poor's 500 index and a 9.81 percent increase in the nasdaq composite index. the year-end results were sharply worse than the first three months of 2007, which ended with richmond-region stocks outperforming major national indexes by about 3 percentage points or more. ""the first half [of 2007] started off well, and then the subprime meltdown hit and the market has been moving sideways ever since,"" said steve marascia, an analyst with anderson &amp; strudwick in richmond. he was referring to the high-risk mortgage market, whose collapse has snowballed to chill credit markets worldwide. will the credit problems affect the u.s. and world economies in 2008? that will depend on consumer behavior and other factors, and it's too soon to tell, marascia said. added brian t. ford, a certified financial planner with rbc dain rauscher: ""it's our view that we're not necessarily headed toward a ***recession**."" the u.s. markets did not do as well as the chinese stock market, which finished the year with a 100 percent gain. however, the fact the u.s. markets are ending the year in positive territory is impressive, given oil and gold prices, continued middle east tension and the decline in the dollar's value, ford said. excluding the consumer and financial sectors, the u.s. markets did quite well, ford said. although economic and job growth may have slowed, ford doesn't believe the economy is headed toward a ***recession**, which is defined as two consecutive negative quarters for the gross domestic product.ford is not ready to recommend that investors put their money on the banking sector, though. ""it's pretty clear that housing and banking still have some problems to sort out,"" he said. going forward, ford said he will be keeping watch on job growth, corporate earnings and business inventory levels to gauge the health of the economy. ""it's been a volatile year and not just in most investment markets,"" said russell e. lundeberg jr., chief investment officer at chesterfield county-based barrett capital management. roiled by a host of major issues, people's perceptions of the economy passed through a series of changes in 2007, he noted. ""it's an unusual time when you see so many intelligent people have such varied opinions [on the economy's direction],"" lundeberg said.

7VKN-HJ80-YB1B-V17M-00000-00.txt,"the biggest differences between the republican budget proposal released april 27 and a draft leaked to the press a month earlier were two components designed to generate more than $500 million in revenue without raising taxes. and those two ideas have created the biggest backlash against the latest proposal.one element of the budget would take $210 million in unspent development impact fees from cities and towns to help balance a $3 billion deficit in the upcoming fiscal year, which begins july 1. the other would sweep $300 million in education funding that school districts have saved over the years to help cover emergency costs.it is unclear exactly how the state would get its hands on the impact fee money, but there are two scenarios that top republicans have examined. one would require cities to voluntarily rebate a portion of the tax revenue they share with the state each month. and, in exchange, lawmakers would temporarily lift restrictions on the use of some of the impact fees, allowing cities to spend the money on general operations.another way for the state to get the money would be to change the urban revenue-sharing rate in a way that would allow the state to keep an extra $210 million that would have gone to the cities, and to suspend the restrictions on using impact fees to help cities sidestep any negative financial impacts of the state takeaway.the idea of taking money collected by cities to help pay for infrastructure was criticized by the league of arizona cities and towns. ken strobeck, executive director of the league, called the issue ""a non-starter"" and said there isn't that much money available for the state to take.""all that money is already committed to, pledged for or paying for infrastructure,"" he said.lawmakers, though, said the league was on board with the plan initially and even provided the figures that led to the proposal to allow the state to keep the additional $210 million in shared revenue.strobeck denied he or his organization had any involvement in crafting the plan other than to inform house republicans that the league did not support the effort.""that is just simply not true. we did not provide any numbers,"" he said.he pointed the finger at the home builders association of central arizona, saying that group originally proposed the idea to republican lawmakers. the home builders association has tried over the years to limit the development impact fees collected by cities.the fees are charged to developers and are designed to offset the immediate costs of growth. the money generally is used to pay for things like roads, sewer expansions and public safety.officials from the home builders association did not return multiple calls seeking comment.some lawmakers were not sold on the idea that the state should take money from the cities because they are facing similar budget problems caused by the economic ***recession**.house appropriations committee chairman john kavanagh, a republican from fountain hills, said some legwork still needs to be done to determine if the funds would be available for the state to use.""i'm not ever sure that i'm on board,"" he said.also, there could be some legal challenges to overcome if the legislature opts to take the money.gov. jan brewer said, ""we certainly have been contacted by the cities, and they are concerned in regards to that. so, that's something that we're going to have to look at and take under advisement and see exactly what that impact is, and then again to see if it's even legal. ""the legality and practicality of taking the money from cities was supposed to be the focus of debate during a joint hearing of the house and senate appropriations committees that was scheduled for april 28. but the meeting was cancelled about an hour before it was to begin, with kavanagh and others saying the home builders association wasn't prepared to make a presentation.meanwhile, the proposal to take $300 million from school districts has drawn fire from education advocacy groups and lawmakers from both parties. the plan to take the money from schools was first identified as a budget component april 17 in a story in the arizona capitol times,groups such as the arizona school boards association and the arizona association of school business officials have argued that the amount of money republicans hope to capture is unrealistic. rep. rich crandall, chairman of the house education committee and former president of the mesa unified school district board, agrees.""there's not $300 million (available). not even close to that,"" crandall said, speculating that less than $100 million would be available to the state.crandall, a republican, said he hopes a committee hearing will allow closer examination of the issue.""putting this out there and then holding public hearings, it's a great way for everyone to hear the same thing - is it legal, what does it mean, and so on,"" he said.the latest budget proposal includes fewer cuts than were presented in the march draft. the earlier version included more than $840 million in spending reductions, but the new house proposal would cut spending by about $667 million. the senate plan calls for $647 million in cuts.funding for the arizona health care cost containment system represents another key point of disagreement between the house and the senate. the senate wants to cut $45 million more than the house, largely by reducing reimbursements for some medical services.funding for public education is another sticking point between the two chambers. the house is pushing to freeze a portion of the k-12 funding for two years, a move the senate opposes.the house plan calls for freezing the property tax rate districts can levy at its current level instead of decreasing it to correspond with the decline of property values in the past year. senate republican leaders said that would amount to a tax increase on homeowners.the plan also makes permanent roughly $600 million in cuts that were included in the fiscal 2009 budget.house minority whip chad campbell, a phoenix democrat, said the cuts to education and other fund sweeps included in the budget proposal would disqualify the state from receiving the bulk of the federal stimulus money that's available to arizona.""it'd be nice if we had a real budget to discuss,"" he said. ""it's april 28 and this is the best budget they can come up with? this is a travesty, this is a shame and this is an insult. ""some republicans see the budget draft as a fluid document that will need changes in order to convince enough members to vote in favor.""i think what you see on paper is far from where we are going to be,"" said rep. vic williams, a tucson republican.other lawmakers said they anticipated complaints from cities and schools and said those concerns aren't enough reason to make significant changes to the budget proposal.""it might be goring some oxes that some find unacceptable, but that's to be expected in this kind of environment,"" said rep. sam crump, a republican from anthem.sen. sylvia allen, a republican from snowflake, said lawmakers will have to tweak the document, but the changes should be minor.""we are working it and tightening the numbers,"" she said.other lawmakers, meanwhile, are calling on brewer to take a more assertive role in the budget process. to date, she has given no indication about what specific items she would like in the budget, and some say time is running out for her to act.there are only 36 working legislative days - the typical legislative work week is monday through thursday - before the fiscal year ends. assistant house minority leader kyrsten sinema, a democrat from phoenix, said she would like to see brewer detail how she intends to spend the federal stimulus money.""that creates a framework for a budget discussion,"" sinema said. ""it cuts down the places (in the budget) where you can screw around. """,5/1/09,0,0,1,,,0

7WCF-SWH1-2R4X-F005-00000-00.txt,"with the launch of an economic recovery all but certain this year -- many experts say it's already begun -- the debate among pundits has turned decidedly alphabetical. in other words, what letter will the rebound resemble -- u, v or w?typically, sharp downturns like the current one yield equally rapid, or v-shaped, upswings. but the worst ***recession** since the great depression has been anything but typical, with housing and credit markets devastated.  in a usa today survey, 63% of economists said the recovery will be slow and gradual, or u-shaped.yet 37% said it will be moderate or fast. and a smattering of experts say the rebound will look like a w, with a precarious economy sliding back into ***recession** before turning around for good. usa today presents the case for each scenario:consumers aren't spendingsharp downturn followed by slow and gradual reboundmost economists, including federal reserve chairman ben bernanke, predict a slow and gradual upturn. to be sure, the telltale recovery signals have been flashing green lately. factory output and new orders grew last month at the fastest pace in two years.  the government's cash-for-clunkers program has lit up a moribund vehicle market.and with inventories of stores and manufacturers depleted, factories must soon ratchet up production just to restock.but most experts say the recovery will be muted, largely because consumers are in no mood to open their wallets. they've lost $13 trillion of wealth in the ***recession**'s housing and stock market crashes and appear determined to sock away any extra cash they have, says mark zandi, chief economist of moody's economy.com. the savings rate jumped to 5.2% in the second quarter from a low of 1% before the crisis. consumer spending accounts for 70% of the economy.meanwhile, the 9.4% jobless rate is keeping consumers ""focused on necessities like food"" and medicine, says sung won sohn, economics professor at california state university.two underpinnings of a robust recovery -- the housing and auto markets -- are suffering from deep-seated problems that won't soon fade. about 1.8 million in excess housing units built during the real estate bubble ensure a tepid rebound in housing starts, zandi says. foreclosures continue to rise. and vehicle sales have been hampered by a credit crisis that's made it tough for consumers and businesses to get loans. it will take time for banks to feel comfortable lending again. while the cash-for-clunkers program has juiced sales lately, that will mean fewer sales next year, zandi says.""it's hard to see how the economy can get going if people and businesses can't borrow money,"" zandi says. he predicts anemic growth of 1% to 2.7% over the next year.hiring will ignite recoverydramatic tumble produces a similarly sharp upswingdespite unusual obstacles in the housing and credit markets, some economists say traditional economic dynamics should still win the day, with the steep downturn producing a sharp rebound. or at least a moderate one.businesses have cut their workforces far more than falling customer demand required in an effort ""to get ahead of the curve,"" says ken mayland, president of clearview economics. ""they're beyond lean, they're understaffed,"" he says. ""they'll have to start re-employing people faster than in past ***recession**s"" just to restock.rising employment should boost consumer spending.also, despite the massive drop in household wealth, the s&amp;p 500-stock index is up 47% since its early march nadir. that should embolden consumers to open their pocketbooks wider than some predict, says dean maki, chief u.s. economist at barclays capital.  so while maki says the savings rate will stay high, that shouldn't prevent consumer spending from rising at least moderately as well. another boost to spending will come from incomes lifted by growing production  and a housing construction rebound, he says.some optimists point to more basic economic principles. consumers have been putting off purchases of everything from cars to appliances, leaving a storehouse of pent-up demand, says chris rupkey, chief financial economist at bank of tokyo-mitsubishi. the population continues to grow 1.1% a year. and the positive economic news, along with rising stocks and gas  prices that have fallen from their $4-a-gallon peak, should buttress consumer confidence, rupkey says. the economic stimulus will likely provide an additional bounce when most of the money is spent next year, optimists say.the economy ""is kind of like a beach ball underwater,"" rupkey says. ""it wants to bounce back.""what's more, automobile and housing sales have fallen so low that a return to even modest levels would mean a 10% to 20% increase and a v-shaped upswing, mayland says. he projects the economy will expand at a fairly vibrant 4% clip in 2010, with unemployment peaking later this year.banks are still tightfisted. but maki says the recovery will likely be driven by higher-income households and businesses ""that don't need credit or are still able to get it.""more pain before the gainsrecovery cut short by ***recession**, then a second rebounda small group of experts believes the nation will endure an unusual w-shaped, or ""double-dip,"" recovery in which the economy falls back into ***recession** before growing again.that's what happened in the early 1980s when the economy soared the first few months of 1981 following a ***recession**, before the federal reserve raised interest rates to head off inflation. that put the brakes on the recovery, setting off another, more severe downturn.steve hanke, professor of applied economics at johns hopkins university, predicts a similar pattern this time. besides keeping a key interest rate near zero, the fed is spending $1.75 trillion to buy government securities in a bid to keep mortgage and other loan rates low.the massive liquidity, plus rising commodity prices, will increase  inflation, says hanke, who is also a fellow at the conservative cato institute. meanwhile, hanke believes the central bank will be loath to raise interest rates to stave off inflation in 2010, because doing so could tamp down what he says will be a weak recovery in an election year.as a result, he says, the fed ""will wait too long"" and then be forced, perhaps in 2011, to raise interest rates sharply, sending the economy back into a tailspin.wells fargo economist mark vitner also believes a w-shaped recovery is possible, but for a different reason. the economy, he says, should grow at a fairly robust 3.4% in the third quarter as manufacturers boost output to replenish stocks. but he says it will likely hit a wall in the first quarter, with little customer demand to keep production up, higher state and local taxes that crimp spending and the expiration of the cash-for-clunkers program. vitner thinks the economy will slow to a 1.8% crawl in the first quarter but could actually shrink before mounting a second, tepid recovery.

4TPX-BX50-TWDC-M1FT-00000-00.txt,"there were early signs that sportfishing wasn't a major concern for the new owners of the hyatt regency mission bay spa and marina.the historic islandia sportfishing landing -- built in the mid-1950s, before the hotel -- had a name change to mission bay sportfishing last year. the tackle shop that once was all about ocean fishing was wedged into a newly renovated facility with, of all things, a bagel shop. boats were still being supplied with anchovies and sardines a few hundred yards away, but the emphasis was more on bagels and lattes than bait and tackle.the landing became more like a touristy gift shop than a fishing concern, and it was clear that fishing was not a priority for new owners kencal ownership llc.slowly, a competitive business that provided anglers an alternative to seaforth sportfishing down the promenade, was transformed into a nonfactor. the owner-captains of the five sportboats at the landing found themselves having to promote their own businesses.all that came to a halt monday when kencal ownership llc, which bought the hyatt in 2006, sunk the entire sportfleet by evicting the five owner-captains from the landing. jason coz of the dolphin, greg miser of the dolphin ii, frank d'anna of the dominator, ernie prieto of the chubasco ii and gary abbamonte of the alexis were told in a one-page notice that they must move their boats from the hyatt dock by nov. 15.audrey doherty, spokeswoman for the hyatt, said the property owners made a business decision and decided to end the sportfishing operation.""they're not required by their lease to run a sportfishing operation,"" said doherty, who said kencal consulted with the city of san diego's real estate department before evicting the boats.doherty said kencal put approximately $60 million into the renovation of the hotel and marina after buying it. that figure is almost double what had been estimated for the renovation after kencal paid $62.5 million for the property.kencal negotiated with the city to extend the hotel and marina lease to 2038.so, the boats are looking for a new home.problem is, ocean sportfishing, like most businesses in the u.s., has felt the sting of a deepening ***economic crisis**. it's yet another sign of the times in which businesses are having severe financial problems. these five captains are feeling the brunt of it at mission bay sportfishing. they don't have a dock, and ocean anglers will have five fewer fishing options on mission bay.""the big difference between them and us is we're not a hotel,"" said john yamate, part owner and general manager at seaforth sportfishing. ""the hotel is their main focus there, their main source of income. sportfishing is a peripheral casualty to them.""yamate said even with 15 and sometimes 16 sportboats operating out of seaforth sportfishing, it's been a tough economic year there, too. fuel prices sent costs skyrocketing. the poor economy kept people home for staycations instead of fishing trips.travis sandoval, an office employee at mission bay sportfishing, said he knew something was up last week when the hotel laid off assistant general manager john taylor, who supervised the sportfishing business.""they're talking about keeping a couple of us around to work the fuel dock and the marina,"" sandoval said.

worried about the stock market, are saving more than they have in the recent past. and typically, they are turning to stable money market accounts, certificates of deposit and other safe havens for their cash -- despite low interest rates.the personal savings rate soared to 5 percent in january, compared with 3.9 percent in december, according to the u.s. department of commerce's bureau of economic analysis.in dollars, the savings totaled $545.5 billion in january, up from $416.8 billion in december, bea reported.personal savings rate is defined as the money left over after subtracting spending from income.and erie-area residents appear to be following the national trend, with deposits on the rise at several banks and credit unions for the first two months of this year.\""i think that saving is back in fashion again,\"" said paul cole, chief operating officer at marquette.that hasn't always been the case.the national personal savings rate actually dipped into negative territory during the third quarter of 2005. it didn't start showing a more significant upswing until the second quarter of 2008, when it rose above 2 percent, according to bea.\""we went through probably a 25-year period where consumption seemed to rule. and now thrift and living within your means hopefully are back in fashion again,\"" cole said.\""i think people are starting to realize that things don't always go up -- that they sometimes do come down,\"" he said, referring to the value of stocks, homes and other commodities.grande figured the dow jones industrials would go down when it hit a record high of 14,165 in october 2007. he closed three mutual funds that were getting stagnant and locked in his profits with secure certificates of deposit at marquette, where he still banks.that hunch paid off, with the market at half its peak value now.\""i'm more cautious of what i'm investing in,\"" said grande, owner of grande's lawn care.cole said some people are parking their money in short-term or liquid accounts while they wait to see if the market -- which has rallied five out of the past six business days -- has hit bottom. others who are worried about their jobs could be building a rainy-day fund, he said.erie-based marquette has seen a combined $3 million increase in deposits in january and february, for a total of $435 million, cole said.the story is similar at several other banks and credit unions.erie federal credit union's deposits are up $18 million over the first two months of the year, or 7.5 percent, for a total of $245 million in deposits, said norb kaczmarek, chief executive of the credit union.another example: northwest savings bank's deposits in erie county increased by $20.6 million from jan. 31 to feb. 28, for a total of $762 million, said jim martin, erie region president for the warren-based bank.\""it appears that maybe people are starting to put some money away because they're concerned about the economy, about their jobs,\"" martin

disantis said.\""i think the average american is just hanging on to what they have. that's the philosophy right now,\"" he said.a mentality of savings over spending won't do much for the economy in the short term.but todd nesbit, assistant professor of economics at penn state behrend, said it will help in the longer term \""because savings ultimately becomes the supply of loanable funds.\""those loans allow for business growth, housing construction and other development that helps to grow the economy, he said.\""in order to borrow, somebody has to be saving,\"" he said.nesbit said some people

nesbit said.wayne koble, senior vice president and market investment director for pnc wealth management in erie, said people have had to play catch-up to increase the personal savings rate.\""if you go back and look at the prior ***recession**s since the end of world war ii, the savings rate was higher in all prior ***recession**s than it has been at the start of this ***recession**,\"" koble said.\""so people really had to make up for their lack of savings, plus the normal savings that takes place any time you have an ***economic slowdown**,\"" he said.nesbit said that savings will decrease again once consumer confidence rises.but he expects savings to be part of the long-term financial mix for kitchen-table budgets. reducing vacations from every year to every other year is one

""unfortunately, many people in their late 40s and 50s may never get jobs again,"" he wrote in a paper published this week. allen, alluding to federal statistics that show 27 percent of the 12.5 million unemployed workers in the country have been without a job for more than six months, said the great ***recession** will serve as a ""watershed event"" for the country. the bearish business professor feels a lot of the additional job loss to come will come from a shrinking auto sector. adding to the frustration among economists is that the predicted spike in unemployment over the next 12 months will occur while the obama administration starts to spend its $1 trillion-plus stimulus cash. in addition to long-term unemployment, medical and financial professionals are bracing for: * increases in suicides * additional weaknesses in banks * continued weakness in consumer spending.

""we look forward to working with the administration,"" said james rohr, the chief executive of pnc, in a statement that summarized the public remarks of the others.this account is based on the recollections and notes of several people who attended the meeting and who spoke on condition of anonymity because the session was private.president obama began by speaking about his concern for the continuing fragility of the financial system and his desire to find long-term solutions so that renewed lending could spark economic growth. he also said that systemic risks had been overlooked during the boom, and that there was a need for corrective action, a reference to the administration's blueprint for regulatory reform.treasury secretary timothy f. geithner presented congress earlier this week with an outline of the administration's financial regulatory plans. the issue is expected to be a major topic when the president meets next week in london with leaders of the world's largest industrial nations.during the meeting yesterday, the president also returned several times to the need for the banks to behave modestly.obama at one point cast the issue through the eyes of ""a single mom trying to make a mortgage payment,"" watching banks that get aid spending money on bonuses, and feeling what he described as justifiable anger. he added that such anger could derail the administration's efforts to help banks through programs designed to clear away troubled assets and provide new capital at public expense.the president, however, spent most of the meeting listening. there were 13 executives seated with obama, and he called on each in turn, beginning with jamie dimon, the chief executive of j.p. morgan chase.dimon told the president that banks had made mistakes: excessive lending, inadequate underwriting and paying some employees too much. he said, however, that the word ""bank"" had become an unfair shorthand for the wide variety of financial institutions that engaged in problematic behavior, including mortgage brokers, insurance companies and money-market mutual funds. he also expressed broad support for the administration's regulatory reform agenda.dimon  was the first of several chief executives to tell the president that his bank has increased its lending.the chief executive of wells fargo, john stumpf, spoke of increased mortgage lending in recent months, which he described as a boon to the economy.richard davis, the chief executive of u.s. bancorp, told the president that his company was placing a particular emphasis on maintaining loans and lines of credit to longtime customers, particularly small businesses, even in cases in which the bank's risk models called for curtailing or ending those relationships.obama responded by encouraging all of the banks to maintain their relationships with existing customers, particularly small businesses. he told the banks that he was reading a lot of letters from smaller employers whose access to credit had been cut.all of the banks at yesterday's meeting have received infusions of taxpayer money, and several of the executives told the president they were eager to repay those investments. the president said he would welcome repayments, but only if doing so would not curtail the banks' ability to make loans.",3/28/09,1,1,1,,,1

his 83rd birthday - after suffering from heart problems in monaco, where he was to give a speech on world finance.barre was prime minister of france in 1976-81 during a 30-year political career that also included posts as vice president of the european commission, french economics minister and mayor of lyon. he made an unsuccessful run for president in 1988.highly suspicious of the media and political alliances, barre spoke sparingly in public and kept his circle of friends small.barre never joined a political party, though he was linked to the center-right udf. he used this position to his advantage by playing free agent as a lawmaker in the national assembly, often voting with the left-wing opposition to the frustration of his conservative allies.still, top politicians from france's governing conservative party expressed their sorrow at barre's death.president nicolas sarkozy called barre a ""free and independent spirit"" and hailed his ""passion for france.""""his international experience and the loftiness of his views made of him ... a unique personality among france's political players,"" sarkozy said in a statement saturday.prime minister francois fillon said in a statement that barre's career ""showed that there is no other way than to tell the french people the truth and sometimes to take difficult measures.""barre's longtime rival, former president jacques chirac, said in a statement that with barre's death, ""france has lost a great economist, a politician who was resolutely committed to the modernization of the country.""born april 12, 1924, in saint-denis on the french island of reunion in the indian ocean, barre studied at the reunion law school before being mobilized into the army in 1944. attached to an artillery unit stationed in madagascar, the war finished before he could ship out.he then moved to paris, where he studied at the institute of political science and received a doctorate in law and economics from the university of paris in 1950.he began his political career in 1959, working at the ministry of industry.charles de gaulle asked barre to represent france at the european commission in brussels in 1972, where he helped form the economic policies of the future european union. former president valery giscard d'estaing called barre ""the best economist in france.""when he returned to france, barre replaced jacques chirac as prime minister, sparking a rivalry that lasted into the 21st century and split the right in france. barre served as prime minister from 1976 to 1981 under giscard.to combat an ***economic crisis** of the late 1970s, barre imposed strict policies to curb inflation and public spending that resulted in thousands of layoffs. when faced with strong opposition from the unions, barre dismissed street protesters and told them to get back to work.in response to these policies, chirac led a group of defectors to found another right-wing party, the rpr. barre remained close to the udf.in 1988, as both conservative parties ran, chirac and barre split the vote, helping socialist president mitterrand win re-election. but chirac was to finally win out as his rpr party grew in strength and he became prime minister a second time, before going on to win the presidency in 1995.barre remained in the national assembly. he was elected mayor of lyon in 1995, and retired from politics in 2002.he continued to teach economics at the prestigious institute of political sciences in paris throughout his life. he was named professor emeritus in 1994.barre is survived by his wife, eva, and their two sons, olivier and nicolas. arrangements for barre's funeral were not immediately known.",8/26/07,0,0,,,,0

7XD3-SD71-2R2Y-71SX-00000-00.txt,"c(""dec. 25--a few days after about 300 san diego taxi drivers went on strike to protest the amount of money they pay to lease cabs, organizers gathered the drivers in a city heights meeting hall to rally them. the impassioned speeches were in somali.in san diego, somali immigrants are nearly synonymous with the taxicab industry. since somalis began settling here in large numbers as refugees in the early 1990s, fleeing a civil war at home, they have come to dominate the business as drivers. while there is no official figure, it is estimated by groups who work with african immigrants and by drivers themselves that at least three-fourths of san diego cabbies are east african, the vast majority from somalia. others are from ethiopia and eritrea, and a few are from other african countries.\""it is the easiest thing to do when you come from another country, and you know how to drive,\"" said hakeem kalif, 40, who arrived from somalia in 1992 and began driving a taxi four years later. \""you only need a thomas guide.\""the cabbies follow in a long-established tradition, the immigrant social hiring network, an informal system of referrals and recruiting that has existed for as long as immigrants have been landing on these shores.just as social networks help determine where new arrivals to the united states settle, they also help determine the jobs they get, with established immigrants helping arriving family members and friends find work.the end result is one ethnic group heavily represented in a particular industry: for example, mexican immigrants in construction, iraqi chaldean immigrants operating liquor and convenience stores, korean immigrants operating small grocery stores, vietnamese immigrants in the nail-salon industry.\""a brings in b, b brings in c, and c brings in d until finally, you've got a through z,\"" said ivan light, a professor emeritus of sociology at ucla and co-author of \""ethnic economies,\"" a book that examines ethnic-dominated industries. \""you don't own the business, but you control access to it, and it becomes a valuable economic resource for the community in the sense that you get to certain point, and you control access to the jobs.\""the same can happen in a corporate environment, light said, recalling a tour of a los angeles bank several years ago during which the manager pointed out to him that on one floor, most of the workers were cuban. the immigrant employees had such a strong social network that they themselves took care of finding applicants when there was a vacancy.\""as soon as one cuban left, they recruited another,\"" light said. \""the bank was happy with it because the cubans were good workers, and the cubans were happy with it because they could find jobs.\""driving a taxi has become a common occupation for somali immigrants and other east africans, not only in san diego but also in minneapolis-st. paul and washington, d.c. in san diego, with an east african population that includes an estimated 15,000 or more somalis, it is not unusual to see a muslim cabbie pull over to observe a call to prayer by taking a moment to pull a small prayer rug onto the sidewalk and kneel toward mecca.most of the local somali cabbies say they were referred to the job by word-of-mouth. ahmed syaed, a driver and strike organizer who sits on the board of a somali taxi drivers association, said the cabbies -- who typically work 12-hour shifts, sharing a car with another driver -- enjoy the flexibility the job gives them to find a few hours here and there for college or trade classes, or to study english. many also have families.\""it is important for us to have such a flexible job,\"" syaed said last weekend during a meeting at the east african community and cultural center in city heights. \""many of us are students here.\""bob montgomery, director of the international rescue committee in san diego, said somali immigrants entered the taxi industry soon after refugees began arriving in san diego, following in the footsteps of earlier ethiopian immigrants, who had also taken to driving cabs. the freedom of driving a cab works for immigrants from these largely agricultural economies, where the climate determines the workday, he said.\""especially with east africans, the 9-to-5 work schedule is something new to them -- not to all of them, but to a lot of them,\"" said montgomery, whose office helped settle the bulk of somali refugees in the area. immigrants from south asia, the west indies and africa make up the bulk of the nation's taxi drivers, said bruce schaller, deputy commissioner for planning and sustainability with the new york department of transportation. five years ago, while working as a private consultant, schaller wrote a report on the growing number of immigrants in the taxi industry.until the 1970s, it was much more common to see native-born u.s. citizens behind the wheel of a cab, he said. things began to change as crime became a growing concern, schaller said, making driving a taxi a riskier occupation than many u.s.-born workers wanted. a changing job market also meant new opportunities for younger drivers, such as temporary office work.according to schaller's research, which was based on u.s. census data, only 8 percent of the nation's taxi and limousine drivers in 1970 were immigrants. by 2000, that had risen to 38 percent, one of the highest proportions of immigrant workers of any occupation in the country.some immigrant drivers see their job as a steppingstone as they study or learn english, schaller said. some have stayed in the industry but have gone on to buy their own taxis or even a fleet; in san diego, for example, immigrant cabbies typically lease from immigrant cab owners, among them russian, middle eastern and other african immigrants, including former drivers. there are about 1,000 taxis in san diego.the striking cabbies are at odds with owners affiliated with yellow cab over lease rates that they say are too high in comparison to their ***recession**-battered earnings. but when the money is good, it's not a bad job to have, schaller said.\""some will be driving a cab for a long time to come,\"" he said. \""but they are very, very proud of their sons and daughters who are going to harvard or mit.\""leslie berestein:

7WXV-4S50-Y92T-G049-00000-00.txt,"new york ? the real referees will work the real games. the nba and its referees union agreed on a two-year contract friday, ending a lockout of more than a month and saving the league from using replacements when the regular season starts. the officials ratified the deal that was reached earlier this week in a vote friday night. no details of the vote were provided, nor were terms of the agreement. ""we are pleased to reach this agreement,"" nbacommissioner david stern said in a statement. ""the negotiations extended further than either side had hoped, but when our regular season tips off on tuesday we'll have the best referees in the world officiating our games."" the referees union did not comment. the referees will begin a three-day training camp saturday and be ready when the regular season starts tuesday. the league had been using replacement officials during exhibition play. the contract between the league and the national basketball referees association expired sept. 1, and the league announced its was locking out the officials on sept. 18, saying they had rejected its final contract offer. the nba decided to go with replacements late last month after the referees rejected a deal the league said its negotiators had already agreed to. that raised the possibility of the league starting the season with replacement officials for the first time since 1995. but progress was made in a meeting this week at league headquarters that included stern, who had previously pulled out of the negotiations after referees lead negotiator lamell mcmorris criticized the commissioner's behavior. stern rejoined the talks this week at the request of the referees. ""it was always our intention to make a deal and our hope. i thought that perhaps the rhetoric had gotten a little bit too heated and it would be better for me to withdraw,"" stern said earlier friday during a conference call. ""but it was requested by the other side that i return and that they were coming in to make a deal and they asked me to be there, and i thought i owed them out of my respect to them to honor that request."" the referees' contracts have usually been for five years, but the nba consented to a two-year deal at the request of the union, which hoped it could renegotiate sooner with the economy hopefully in better shape. the sides agreed on a salary structure that would give the refs a slight raise in the second year, but they remained apart on proposed changes to the referees' pension and severance packages, as well as a plan to develop younger officials by having them work in nba games. negotiations broke down multiple times. stern angered the union when he abruptly ended one negotiating session, feeling the officials were reneging on previously agreed upon items. the league later accused the union of doing that again after the full roster of referees rejected a deal that had been reached in principle. mcmorris pulled out after that collapse, though he also returned and took part in the meeting this week. the league used a roster of 62 replacements, mostly from the nba development league and wnba, during the lockout. stern said the backups ""responded very well"" and predicted that many would referee nba games again. ""we of course knew we have to provide them with extra support, coaching and training, but they've responded very well,"" stern said during the conference call. ""we're very pleased with the effort, and we know you'll be seeing many of the people who you've seen on our court as future nba referees. the replacement officials were criticized for calling too many fouls, though the amount decreased later in the exhibition season, which ended friday night. ""as the preseason went on, they were better,"" houston coach rick adelman said. ""i don't think they were arrogant, or anything like that. they gave the explanations and they were doing the best they could. ""the first couple (games) were just foul after foul and call after call and there was no rhythm to the games,"" adelman added. ""after that, i thought it settled down fairly well. they just called things differently than the normal officials. they're pretty much going by the book."" some of the replacements likely will get another chance. the current staff includes 17 referees who started as replacements during previous work stoppages. economy impacts nba rosters: the still-scuffling u.s. economy may keep some nba teams from starting the season with a full, 15-player roster, according to a survey of all 30 franchises by the associated press. with the season opening next week and final rosters due on monday, the survey found that nearly half the league plans to start with 15 players. but others will carry the minimum 13 or leave one spot empty. chief among the reasons was flexibility ? having an available spot or two to keep options open for trades or injuries in the long, 82-game season. no teams outright said their decision would be driven by the economy, but the bottom line is clearly an issue. ""nba teams are businesses like every other in this country,"" dallas mavericks owner mark cuban wrote in an e-mail to ap. ""times are tough and i expect many if not most teams to carry fewer than 15 players on their rosters."" nba teams are allowed to carry 12 active and three inactive players. not filling all 15 slots would not leave a team at less than full strength for games, though it might leave it short-handed for practices. denver will start with a 13-player model after going with 14 last season and the full 15 in the two seasons prior. in the first seven games last season, the nuggets used more than nine players only once. mark warkentien, the team's vice president of basketball operations, said he likes having chairs open at the end of the bench, just in case. ""there's an obvious economic benefit. i'm not going to deny it,"" warkentien said. ""the compelling reason is the flexibility."" the minimum nba salary this season is about $457,000 for rookies. the luxury tax threshold is about $70 million, meaning teams must pay a $1 tax for every dollar spent on salaries above that limit in a given year. expectations by coaches and general managers for their roster sizes this season are generally in line with previous years. l.a. clippers general manager and coach mike dunleavy, for instance, said he's carried 15 players the past few years ? 14 with guaranteed contracts ? and expects the same again for this season. but dunleavy also said the clippers have less of a financial burden this year by signing younger guys to less expensive deals. ""if we hadn't, then i think i probably wouldn't have had a 15th guy,"" dunleavy said. ""everybody is very conscious of the revenue situation."" cuban said he would like the mavericks to carry only 13 players but will likely max out his roster after dallas carried 16 guaranteed contracts into training camp. a trade left the mavs with 15 guaranteed deals and one non-guaranteed contract ahead of monday's deadline.the climate is bad news for players because it could mean fewer jobs in the league. curtis jerrells, an undrafted rookie from baylor who was cut by san antonio this week, said he feared economic factors could make sticking with a team more difficult. ""that's stuff i can't really control,"" said jerrells, whom the spurs didn't waive for financial reasons. ""the economic deal ... this is my dream. regardless of what happens i'll go out and play hard. i'll be ok with it."" billy hunter, executive director of the national basketball players association, said the union is waiting to see whether nba teams really keep rosters leaner this season or whether it's simply talk. the ***economic crisis** and the number of teams struggling led hunter and nbacommissioner david stern to begin their collective bargaining talks early, in august, even though the current agreement runs through 2011. ""obviously it's a concern for us as a union because we want to employ our guys,"" hunter said. ""so for every two guys on a team cut, you take 30 teams and if everybody reduced their roster by two, that's 60 jobs. so we're obviously concerned."" minnesota is leaning toward carrying 13 players this season after maxing out their roster a season ago. like denver, miami, atlanta, charlotte and philadelphia may also go a player or two fewer than a year ago. charlotte, which has lost millions each year since coming into the league in 2004-05, kept training camp at home this season to help cut costs and let go staff, including a scout. the bobcats carried 15 players for most of last season but considered 14 during the preseason. the heat have generally carried 15 players and haven't ruled out doing so this year. miami already entered training camp $3 million into the dollar-for-dollar tax, and team president pat riley wants as much financial flexibility as possible heading into next summer's potential free-agent bonanza in the nba. the washington wizards, meanwhile, are spending more on salaries this season than ever before and, with a $78 million roster, will be paying the luxury tax for the first time. it's about $8 million more than the wizards spent last season ? even though they expect to go from 15 to 14 players. san antonio went on an atypical spending spree this summer to bolster its title chances, taking richard jefferson and the $29.2 million owed to him over the next two years off milwaukee's hands in exchange for three aging bench players. milwaukee will still carry 15 this season but would have preferred 14 for flexibility and injuries, bucks general manager john hammond said. but are smaller rosters more about roster flexibility, or the economy? ""they go hand in hand,"" hammond said.  veteran guard jackson retires: bobby jackson is retiring from the nba. the 12-year veteran guard, who spent six seasons with sacramento, made the announcement friday night before the kings' preseason finale against the utah jazz. jackson averaged 9.7 points per game in his career. he was the league's sixth man of the year in 2002-03 with averages of 15.2 points, 3.7 rebounds and 3.1 assists. the former university of minnesota star played for sacramento last season but was not re-signed in the offseason. ""it's a tough day for me because i'm retiring from professionally playing the game i love,"" he said. ""but it's also a happy day because i'm retiring on my own terms."" jackson will work with the kings as an ambassador, promoting the team in local appearances and handling some scouting.

4S5M-8WF0-TW8F-G1M3-00000-00.txt,"c(""ben stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. e-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com"", ""as the market keeps torturing us, many people say the problem is fallout from the losses in subprime mortgages. others say it is fear of a ***recession** because of the credit crisis, rising oil prices and the collapsing dollar and its flip side, inflation.  we could be in for much more pain as profits fall  this year, and maybe even into 2009. financial companies account for a huge hunk of total corporate profits -- or they did.   and we could be in for more suffering if the currents of fear whipped up by the short-sellers grow into tidal waves.   markets can certainly fall: from 1926 through 2007, the standard &amp; poor's 500-stock index  fell 3 out of every 10 years. some declines can be substantial. and there can be times like the 1970s  when the market is sluggish  for cruelly long periods.    as we are now seeing, real estate is far from a consistent shelter. and, for many of us, there isn't much time before we'll  want to hang up our spurs. (actually, i don't ever plan to hang up my spurs. i plan to die going through an airport security line en route to a speech.)  so what do we do? i am going to be honest here: i don't know. or at least i don't know for sure. (hey, honesty may not be the best policy, but it's worth trying every once in a while, as my old chief, richard nixon, once said. he had a much better sense of humor than is usually believed.) but i do have some general considerations that should guide you.  no one ever went broke from too much liquidity. in volatile times like these, cash is your best friend, aside from your dogs and cats. true, you earn very little interest on cash these days. true, if the stock market has a huge move up and you are largely in cash, you will be sad.  but it is also true that cash does not crash -- although it does slowly but surely lose its value. you can pay your bills with it without having to sell it at a loss. so, as my pal ray lucia, the san diego money manager, has taught me over the years, your first bucket of money should be in cash.  having a plan is vital. it does not have to be a perfect or precise plan. indeed, it cannot be, because you cannot forecast your rate of return or cost of living. but a rough plan to get you to and through retirement (to the rainbow bridge, where you meet all your departed dogs and cats) is a must.   nowadays, alas, such a plan must consider  the likelihood of much higher inflation than we had expected, as imports and food costs skyrocket. and we have to plan for the possibility of prolonged low returns from stocks. that means more saving.  third, we have to be diversified: large- and small-capitalization stocks, foreign and domestic, emerging and developed markets. my own preference is for index funds, but there may be some fine managed funds out there, too.  diversification should also include real estate investment trusts, with their fabulous yields, and commodities, which can easily be bought through index funds. commodities may well have hit an air pocket, as commodities do, but they will be back someday.  my preference for a plan would also include guaranteed income that you cannot outlive --  and that means annuities. there are now fixed annuities and variable annuities that give you inflation protection as well as protection from a collapse of the stock market. of course, you have to pay for this, as you would for any hedge, but it can allow you to sleep better. investigate the fees carefully and buy only the features that you want and need.  fourth, plan for living more frugally. this is not easy for some of us. ''what were once vices are now habits,'' as the doobie brothers once said. this is true for millions of us, but we simply cannot escape the logic and power of arithmetic.   we cannot live forever on more than we have in principal and interest (or earnings ) and pensions. if that means no more second homes, or no more third cars,  so be it.   no comfort is worth putting yourself in genuine fear of poverty. for me, your humble scribe, this is a vicious problem, but at some point, it must be solved.  but  look on the bright side. my pal and investment guru phil demuth and i have shown repeatedly that the best returns for stocks come after periods of extreme pessimism. it is just when the horizon seems darkest and cloudiest that we find above-par returns. and it is just when  hopes seem dimmest for the united states that the economy starts to rally. if you have enough liquidity, if you are well diversified, now would be a good time to start back into the buying pool, in the most diversified way imaginable.  the best time to go house-hunting may be when pundits say the housing market is hopeless. that market, too, will eventually turn around. many homes bought decades ago, when prices seemed insanely high, are now a steal. if you do buy a home, be patient. the days of flipping for easy money are long gone.  prudence is the order of the day.  if we can remember that, we'll really be well off when, soon enough, the good times start rolling again.

what really is going on in jefferson city, other than in a short news item (""best of political fix,"" feb. 12). we are referring to the amount of time the missouri house spent debating a resolution on the freedom of choice act, which does nothing to address the growing challenges of joblessness and lack of health care in our state.fifteen members of the ncjw went to jefferson city to advocate for expansion of health care, to support the earned income tax credit and to support a bill to reinstate comprehensive sex education in our public schools. we heard our legislators on the house floor in full debate of a nonbinding resolution to express dislike of foca, a bill that has not even been introduced in congress.that the legislature chose to spend time on this resolution when missouri faces a $300 million budget deficit and when close to 800,000 missourians lack health insurance is an insult to missourians who look to our state government to deal with real problems in our state.as an advocacy and community service organization, ncjw knows that non-profit groups cannot meet the growing needs of our citizens. our back-to-school! store, which served a record 936 children last year, already is hearing requests form social service agencies and churches for more children to be served. because of the ***economic downturn**, corporate grants, which supported this project, are

audubon's new report uses millions of detailed bird observations to demonstrate that global warming already is disrupting our environment here at home and has been for more than 40 years (""birds wintering farther north, annual study says,"" feb. 10). this is disturbing evidence that global warming is not just about effects far in the future or far away, but here and now in what amounts to an uncontrolled experiment on our environment.it took decades of research by dedicated citizen scientists to provide this evidence, and it will take citizen involvement and action to do something about it.president barack obama has said he will make the united states a leader in addressing global warming. urge our congressional delegation to stand with him and sign the audubon petition at

habits to reduce your personal impact on the environment. it will save you money and it is good for the birds.mitch leachman | maryland heights executive director, st. louis audubon societyameren's white elephantamerenue's plan for meeting future electricity demands is already out of date and may saddle us with a nuclear power plant that turns out to be a big white elephant. there's an excellent chance that the excess power will not be needed 10 years from now when the plant is scheduled to come on line. laws already are changing in ways that will require serious energy conservation over the next decade. the federal economic stimulus package will provide energy grants only to states that give utilities incentives to conserve. california has not increased its electricity energy use for the past five years despite a growing population because it requires its utilities to promote conservation. the result has been less energy use per capita with no need for either new coal-fired or nuclear plants.it's obvious that energy conservation is in our future, whether we like it or not, and over the next decade we can expect a wave of new laws to require it. by the time we've done as much conserving as we can do, it is likely that ""green"" energy sources will be much more available and efficient than they are now. ameren needs get ahead of the curve, initiate the kinds of conservation programs in use in other states and invest in ""green power.""meanwhile, keep in mind that while the operation of nuclear plants may not contribute to greenhouse gases, the construction of those plants undoubtedly does. those towers look like they contain a lot of cement, which is produced by an energy-intensive, dirty process. it seems to me that serious conservation, accompanied by investments in ""green power"" (not including nuclear) is the way to go.gail ahumada | st. louisdon't forget tifsrecent letters about st. louis county's property assessment system omitted a main

congressional proceedings related to the economy, i feel like a minority of two: phil gramm and me. he was right on in stating there are too many whiners.over the years, marketers and politicians have evolved a culture that transforms ""wants"" to ""needs."" most of our ""poor"" live luxuriously relative to the majority of the world. the value of the benefits they receive results in a net worth equal to or exceeding that of many taxpaying middle-class families. the recent extension of the digital tv phase-over is a prime example of ""want"" over ""need.""as a taxpayer, i resent enabling the ""poor"" non-taxpayer to a higher standard of living than mine. all the talk of increasing dollars toward health, education, etc. misses the point: socialism has failed, is failing and will fail further. we must devolve to a good-better-best approach in assessing need. the poor non-taxpayer is entitled to good health care in a clinic environment and good public education; the middle-class taxpayer is entitled to better health care as provided for by the health insurance for which he sacrifices to pay and should receive tax breaks if he sacrifices for better private education; and the wealthy are entitled to whatever their wealth allows.as a hard-working, fiscally prudent, middle-class, tax-paying capitalist, i found myself able to contribute to socialistic endeavors of my choice. if we continue the socialistic trend, future generations will be unable to do so. thomas a. grunzinger | frontenactested watersboth the feb. 10 editorial cartoon and the

president who seems to choke on the words ""come, let us reason together,"" and says instead, ""i won.""after having demolished mr. limbaugh, the editorial moves on to refer to the economy being in ""uncharted waters."" that merely shows ignorance, because we've been in these waters before, notably in 1930. it would be helpful if the editorial had explained why congress throwing pork at the rocks of poor economic performance in 2009 will work any better than it did when congress threw pork at them from 1932 to 1940. the next real whirlpool in the waters was the disaster of the mid-1960s, when we tried to fight a war, rebuild society and eliminate poverty, and congress pumped out pork as though it were toxic waste. by the time we'd worked our way out of that, we were into the late

7V35-KBB1-2PFY-40MH-00000-00.txt,"c(""when does a ***recession** become a depression?"", ""is the u.s. in a depression? while economists can't even agree on a definition, the simple answer is no, not yet. a replay of the great depression looks far-fetched, thanks in part to the many safeguards in place--including deposit insurance, unemployment insurance and a certain willingness on the part of the authorities to print money. that's the good news. the bad: this could be the start of a deep and long-lasting ***recession**, a depression with a lowercase \""d.\""by loose agreement, a ***recession** shades into a depression when it stretches out for 36 months. the u.s. has until january 2011 before it crosses that line. by comparison, the great depression lasted from 1930 to 1941, just before the u.s. entered world war ii. two other depth readings when it comes to depression: a large drop in economic output--some put it at a 10% gdp drop over a year or so--and a rise in unemployment to more than 11%.in the last quarter of 2008 the economy shrank at a 3.8% annual rate. that's awful, but we'd need ten additional quarters of similarly dismal results to lose 10% of gdp. to put that in perspective: output fell 27% from 1929 to 1933. that translates into a $3.7 trillion decline in today's economy, which is unlikely, says russell roberts, a professor of economics at george mason university. \""of course, that's probably what they thought in 1931, too. 'it can't be as bad as 1894'\""--when output dropped 9.8% from 1893.keep an eye on job losses, a key driver in the feedback loop characteristic of economic cycles. if you're out of work, you spend less, sales decline and companies cut payrolls even further. in the past year the u.s. unemployment rate has climbed from 4.9% to 7.6%--not quite the epic horror of the 1930s, when the rate jumped to 25% in 1933 from 8.9% in 1930. that said, if unemployment crosses the post-world war ii peak of 10.8%, reached in 1982, you'll hear more economists call this downturn a depression. (a more accurate picture, some argue, includes those who have stopped looking for work after coming up empty and those reluctantly working part-time. this broader rate is 13.9% now and would probably be 20% in a depression.)another cause for worry: the $13 trillion erased from u.s. household balance sheets by the twin plunges in the stock and housing markets over the last two years, says david rosenberg, north american economist at merrill lynch. feeling poorer (and less secure about their jobs), u.s. citizens are spending less and saving more. rosenberg thinks we won't begin consuming and borrowing at our usual irresponsible levels again until we've erased $6 trillion or so in debt. \""we're going back to a world of 10% to 12% savings rates,\"" he says--levels not seen since the mid-1980s. indeed, the savings rate jumped to 3.6% in december 2008 from 0.4% a year earlier. consumer spending, 70% of economic activity, dropped for six consecutive months through december. rosenberg is one of a chorus of economists who fret that tax cuts in any stimulus bill will prompt most americans to stash the money away or pay down their debts--$2.6 trillion on autos and credit cards, $10.5 trillion on home mortgages--rather than spend their way out of the ***recession**.a potential threat to recovery is a trade war. the smoot-hawley act of 1930 set in motion a rise in tariffs that deepened the depression and still haunts economists. in severe downturns the temptation to throw up barriers is almost irresistible: protect domestic industries by raising the cost of imported goods and services--and keep jobs in america. doesn't work that way. \""i guess they're thinking, 'if i block imports then i can export my way out of this,'\"" muses peter schott, an expert on international trade at the yale school of management. \""but that supposes you're the only one blocking imports.\"" a potential dustup with france--they refuse to buy u.s. meat; the u.s. makes roquefort cheese three times as expensive--is the least of it. the terrifying scenario is a trade war with china, which holds an estimated $900 billion worth of u.s. debt just through treasurys. despite tough talk on currency manipulation, washington is unlikely to provoke beijing too far--and china would have to think twice about inflaming a trading partner that buys 19% of its exports.a more urgent question is that as uncle sam continues to spend its way out of the national mess, will the chinese still accept a 2.9% yield on ten-year treasurys? at some point it would seem that the u.s. antidepression medicine would have to induce the side effect of inflation, which would run up interest rates. however this turns out, there's no escaping the bill for fiscal stimulus.""

''got to get the money somewhere.''  the summer job outlook for teenagers is beyond bleak. a modest 157,000 jobs were added to the nation's payrolls in may. but teen employment fell for the fifth consecutive month, an ominous trend as we head into the summer months when millions of additional teenagers join in the hunt for jobs.  from january through may, according to the center for labor market studies at northeastern university in boston, ''the national teen employment rate averaged only 33.1 percent, tying for the lowest employment rate in the past 60 years.''  for youngsters like emmanuel wayne and others in this distressed city just a stone's throw from philadelphia, the problem is much worse. last summer, the employment rate for black teens from low-income families was an abysmal 18 percent.  this is the flip side of the american dream. kids who grow up poor and never work at a regular job tend not to think in terms of postgraduate degrees, marriages and honeymoons, careers and the cost of educating the next generation.  a steady job could make all the difference. along with the paycheck comes a sense of the possibilities. kids develop a clearer understanding of the value of education and are more likely to stay in school. the heightened sense of self-worth that comes from gainful employment can be a bulwark against negative peer pressure. contacts are made and a work history established.  ''the more you work today, the more you're going to work tomorrow,'' said andrew sum, director of the center for labor market studies. ''and the more you work while you're in school, the easier it is to transition to the labor market when you graduate.''  it seems obvious that we should be putting as many young people to work as possible, but the opposite is happening. the youth labor market in the u.s. has all but collapsed. teens were especially hard hit by the ***recession** that followed the employment boom of the late 1990s, and there has been no substantial recovery in the teen job market since then.  years ago the federal government played a major role in bolstering job opportunities for teenagers. there was substantial bipartisan support for both year-round and summer employment programs. but that important commitment vanished with the conservative onslaught of recent years.  the result was inevitable. as the center has reported, ''far fewer youth across the nation are gaining exposure to the job market and to the real world of work than in the late 1980s and 1990s.''  what you are left with are frustrated youngsters, full of energy but lacking appropriate outlets, who have trouble figuring out what to do with themselves. it's an environment that is all but guaranteed to spawn bad choices.  i asked emmanuel what he might do if he couldn't find a job for the summer.

4T7G-61C0-TX2J-40WX-00000-00.txt,"washington --- the u.s. economy is sickly, suffering from too much debt, stagnating wages and slow growth.so this campaign season, presidential and congressional candidates will be promoting cures such as cutting taxes or increasing infrastructure spending to create jobs.how 20th century.to rob atkinson, the old ideas about lowering taxes or creating road-paving jobs are just that --- old. for the 21st century, atkinson argues, america needs new policies that recognize the central role that advanced technologies play in spurring growth.he calls this approach ""innovation economics,"" and he's on a campaign to convert policy-makers by showing them how new technologies can turbocharge growth.""innovation is what is driving growth, and there are policies one could employ to support innovation,"" said atkinson, president of the information technology and innovation foundation, a nonprofit research group created in 2006 by donors who support his agenda.atkinson says government should be using tax incentives and more spending to spur research and development, generate new patents and turn out more science and engineering graduates. research done by educated americans can result in inventions that generate jobs and profits, he argues. from 1980 to 2001, all of the net growth in u.s. jobs came from firms less than 5 years old, while older companies actually lost jobs, he says.unfortunately, in the capital of the world's largest economy, ""the 'priesthood' opposes these policies,"" atkinson said. here, political leaders are split into three groups generally known as supply siders, keynesians and ""rubinomics"" supporters, he said.republicans typically are supply siders, who say government should cut taxes to increase incentives for people to supply more goods and services. former president ronald reagan remains the patron saint of these believers.democrats favor the ideas of deceased british economist john maynard keynes, who helped shape new deal policies in the 1930s. he argued that government should spend money and cut interest rates during ***recession**s to stimulate growth.the third group supports policies championed by robert rubin, who was former president bill clinton's treasury secretary from 1995 to 1999. rubin believes congress should shrink the federal deficit to discourage inflation and keep savings flowing into the stock market instead of government securities.atkinson says lower taxes, new bridges and balanced budgets might be nice, but they won't make americans richer. to upgrade our living standard, he says, government must support technological innovation. for example, government spending led to the invention of the mainframe computer and the internet, he noted.""the way you drive innovation is when the public and private sectors work together,"" he said. ""an r&amp;d tax credit does distort the economy, but the growth vastly outweighs the costs.""today, the idea that real growth comes only from technology might well be disputed by, say, home builders who think our economic problems stem from the housing sector's free fall.they would argue that tax credits for home buyers and tax cuts for builders would bolster the industry. government spending on new roads would improve the job market and provide better access to new housing subdivisions. a balanced budget would encourage capital to shift from government securities to mortgage securities.together, such policies would revive housing, and as everyone knows, buying a house is a great investment for the average american, the builders argue.""i'm sorry, but those ideas are just black magic,"" atkinson says.""housing is just amortized consumption,"" he said. ""it's not an investment.""pouring too much money into housing from 1995 to 2005 led to today's poor economy, he said. ""we threw in money, and out came houses, but we didn't get any growth,"" he said.alex brill, an economist at the american enterprise institute, a conservative think tank, believes government would do more to help innovation by cutting taxes. ""you don't want to reduce the rewards from innovation by increasing public spending"" in ways that might raise taxes, he said.atkinson has been fighting such arguments for years, formerly as vice president of another think tank, the progressive policy institute.in the early 1990s, he served as a project director at the now defunct congressional office of technology assessment, where he examined the impact of technology on cities.while many of atkinson's ideas do sound good to political leaders, they get little traction in washington. that's because realtors, builders and restaurant owners greatly outnumber computer engineers, he said. ""dell doesn't have a plant everywhere, but the realtors have hundreds of members in every district,"" he said.so his think tank's six wonks will continue cranking out studies and lectures to try to persuade policy-makers. his funding comes from technology companies, wealthy individuals and foundations.on sept. 25, they are inviting congressional staffers and journalists to a forum titled, ""innovation economics for the next administration."" he is confident he will wear down lawmakers with his logic and statistics.

4V9C-BYD0-TX12-N038-00000-00.txt,"c(""jan. 4--the internationally renowned american shakespeare center in staunton is hardly alone among theaters facing a dramatic financial situation stemming from the current economic ***recession**.but if a california theater is any example, a lot of money can be raised in a short time to keep what many there have seen as a valuable community contributor.shakespeare santa cruz, which has not been profitable for several years, learned in december it would no longer receive money from the university of california at santa cruz's arts division, which had been absorbing the theater's deficits.it had eight days to raise $300,000 or face closure in 2009. the theater raised $416,417 from more than 2,050 individual donors, allowing it to stay open with a reduced budget of $1.49 million, down from $2 million in 2008. the theater had projected a $500,000 loss last year.\""santa cruz did their campaign, and that was a big wake-up call for us,\"" said david dreyfoos, managing director at asc, which just started its own cash appeal. \""if we don't go public with this, we'll be way behind.\""other theaters in the u.s. also face money troubles. in beverly, mass., the north shore music theatre needs to raise $500,000 to stay open until late spring, and another $4 million to open next season.for the baltimore opera company, the situation is worse. it filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and canceled shows through may, though it says that, following an administrative reorganization, it intends to return to producing grand opera.donna law, vice president of the shakespeare theatre association of america and the managing director of the orlando shakespeare theater, said theater and arts programs across the u.s. are feeling the crunch with declining income from sponsors, donors and foundations.\""there are dozens that i personally know of, and i suspect that there are dozens and dozens of others that are trying to anticipate what the future is to hold,\"" law said.the orlando shakespeare theater, she said, has made budget adjustments and reallocated resources.\""we're very much aware of the fact that our patrons that are living on fixed incomes have less discretionary income,\"" law said.asc, home to the world's sole re-creation of shakespeare's indoor theater with the 300-seat blackfriars playhouse that opened in september 2001, says it needs to raise $250,000 by the end of january, and has until may to raise another $400,000.dan layman, chairman of the group's board of trustees, e-mailed supporters last tuesday, warning of the theater's \""grave\"" need in order to hold onto key programs and preserve the theater's future.having cut $250,000 from its budget, including six full-time positions, asc has depleted cash reserves, and is left with about $2.9 million in its current budget and 11 to 12 full-time employees, not including actors.\""we're a very small staff anyway, and this really brought us down to a skeleton crew,\"" dreyfoos said.none of asc's money comes from the city of staunton, though in june 2008 it received a $112,500 grant from the virginia commission for the arts. the theater received about 90 percent of that money prior to state budget cuts in october, but its last check will be 82 percent less than what the group was expecting, dreyfoos said. the arts commission lost 15 percent of its overall budget during state budget cuts.asc is hoping for a boost in ticket sales during a generally slow winter season with the opening of its actors renaissance season. ticket sales in december were up 15 percent over the same time last year, but deirdre sullivan, asc's director of development, said she hopes the current campaign will not be a deterrent to potential theatergoers. the group generates 60 percent of its income from ticket sales and another 40 percent from contributions. the theater has slightly fewer than 900 donors, the small number coming from a lack of a broad donor base, sullivan said.\""in order to reach our goal of $650,000, we need a lot more than 900 people to contribute to our campaign,\"" sullivan said.layman's e-mail said the theater's immediate future would be threatened without the cash infusion. theater officials say the economy has taken its toll on schools bringing students to the theater and on finding performance locations for its traveling troupe.january is typically a hard month for asc, but dreyfoos said it is worse now because the traveling troupe lost an entire week's worth of bookings with one university cancellation. other universities have canceled asc troupe visits in february and march.the nonprofit americans for the arts in washington, d.c., estimated asc's economic impact to staunton and the augusta county region at nearly $4.6 million in fiscal year 2007. during that time, the theater sold 54,138 tickets, with approximately 25,000 people from across the u.s. and abroad visiting staunton.through the first four days of asc's fundraising campaign, it has raised about $25,000, mostly from current donors giving anywhere from $5 to $1,000. before september, the theater received about three online donations yearly. by friday morning, sullivan said it had received 20, with more coming in throughout the day. donors can go to the theater's web site, donate through the facebook causes program or send a check to the theater.with dreyfoos adamant about not closing the doors to the theater, he said asc is having to look at its entire organization and core values, and said it will continue to be \""smart and cautious\"" in future business plans. sullivan said without enough donations, its young company theatre camp (ages 9-12) and its midsummer day camp (ages 13-18) are in danger, as the theater has yet to commit to them for the upcoming summer.\""it's someplace we don't want to cut because it's so important for those young people,\"" sullivan said.she said the theater had contemplated programming cuts in january, but said \""it didn't make sense\"" upon closer study.law said theaters like the one in santa cruz, which staved off closing, and in staunton, will have to continue making adjustments. she believes, however, that arts programs can, in the phrasing of asc's current campaign, \""survive and thrive.\""\""it's just a little harder for us because so much of what we do is based on contributed income,\"" law said. \""and that's the donations, that's the discretionary income. people have less income, or think they do. it's going to be tough for a while, but arts are always going to be a part of our lives.\""to see more of the news virginian or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.newsvirginian.com. copyright (c) 2009,

(such a provision might appeal to a plumbing or electrical services firm that puts up a new building or addition, he said.)-- a state sales tax rebate, or local property tax rebate, for a business that locates in a vacant building.-- a property tax credit, or outright grant, equal to up to 25 percent of pre-approved costs, for a local business -- such as a main street retailer -- that makes improvements to the exterior of its building.-- a refundable state tax credit for a small business that spends more than $100,000 this year or next year to modernize or expand its facilities, business systems and/or equipment, including information systems.-- a \""business venture\"" tax credit to someone who invests more than $100,000 in an early stage business for pre-commercialization activity related to proprietary technology.-- state grants, awarded through a competitive process, to individuals or businesses that seek federal research and development funds for the development and commercialization of innovative products, processes or services. (grant money would be applied to grant-writing and travel expenses.)the forum was held to address the persistent ***recession**, which has contributed to the state's unemployment rate of 12.9 percent in october, one of the highest rates in the nation. about 73,700 rhode islanders were officially counted as out of work.mazze told house members at the forum that he recently studied states with low rates of unemployment -- such as north dakota, nebraska, utah and wyoming -- and \""they have these types of tax breaks\"" for small businesses.mazze said that rhode island scores poorly on a number of nationwide studies on state and local tax burdens and other such issues. \""we're on all of the wrong lists for the wrong reasons,\"" he told house members.rhode island needs to encourage the growth and development of small businesses, which in turn would lead to the creation of more jobs, mazze said.more than 90 percent of the businesses in rhode island are small businesses, \""and we need to support them,\"" he told house members.costantino said of mazze's proposal, \""it's something to look at, as long as [the tax breaks and other such incentives] produce the promises of job growth.\""murphy said of mazze's plan, \""i want to be open to it.\"" murphy said he was particularly interested in mazze's proposal geared toward revitalizing local downtown business districts.murphy said he remembers a vibrant main street in west warwick when he was a boy. \""i know in the last 40 years, our main street in west warwick has not come back to where it was,\"" he said.murphy also said he generally favors targeted tax breaks and other such incentives. \""i think what some of the critics of tax credits fail to look at is the multiplier effect,\"" he said. if tax breaks and other incentives are properly targeted, \""you will derive the benefit,\"" he said.roland benjamin, co-owner and chief financial officer of lfi inc., a manufacturing and engineering services shop in smithfield, said that he would welcome specialized tax breaks geared toward small business, especially because they would provide some relief from what he described as the state's burdensome overall tax structure.\""if [rhode island's] tax structure was reasonable in the first place, you wouldn't need them,\"" benjamin said in an interview at his firm on wednesday.ndowning@projo.comto see more of the providence journal or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.projo.com. copyright (c) 2009, the providence journal, r.i. distributed by mcclatchy-tribune information services. for reprints, email tmsreprints@permissionsgroup.com, call 800-374-7985 or 847-635-6550, send a fax to 847-635-6968, or write to the permissions group inc., 1247 milwaukee ave., suite 303, glenview, il 60025, usa."",

4TGP-G9S0-TW87-N00W-00000-00.txt,"early thursday morning, treasury secretary henry m. paulson jr. sipped diet coke from a disposable cup in his large office overlooking the white house. behind him, four flat-screen computer monitors flashed the latest financial data from around the world. eight aides huddled nearby.for months, paulson had been running from crisis to crisis, engineering rescues for disintegrating firms. now a cataclysm was rapidly enveloping global markets, triggering a run on money-market funds that once had been considered safe investments. paulson decided there was only one way to stop it: the u.s. government must intervene big and intervene fast.across town, federal reserve chairman ben s. bernanke had come to the same conclusion. together they joined in on an 8:30 a.m. conference call with other top economic policymakers to sketch out what would become the most sweeping public intervention into the private economy in modern history. they thought their plan could soothe the hysteria. but first, they would have to sell it to a restless congress in the middle of a fractious political campaign.that decision led to a late-night meeting in the u.s. capitol, where paulson and bernanke warned congressional leaders that they must take urgent action to prevent a global meltdown. the two men provided only a broad outline of their plan; yesterday, lawmakers still had many questions. and though democratic leaders vowed to approve legislation next week giving the treasury expansive new powers, it remains unclear whether they have the votes to do it.the discussion of a broader market bailout, which is estimated to cost taxpayers at least $500 billion, began in earnest on monday as treasury and fed officials were working to rescue insurance giant american international group. few, if anyone, believed that the effort -- a stunning $85 billion takeover that effectively nationalized one of the world's largest insurance firms -- would stem the ***financial crisis**. more had to be done. but what?this account draws from interviews with federal officials, lawmakers and congressional staffers who participated in the meetings. many spoke on the condition of anonymity because much of the discussions occurred in private meetings.bernanke had been leaning toward comprehensive government action for some time. but he didn't want to spend any more of the fed's money without the blessing of congress. paulson was more reluctant about putting taxpayer dollars at risk. he also worried that if he laid out a plan and congress balked, markets would twist in the wind and fall into further turmoil.but the massive disruption of the financial system on tuesday and wednesday quickly dissolved any lingering doubts. the aig rescue hadn't calmed nerves. in fact, there appeared to be a run developing on money-market mutual funds, a $3.5 trillion pool of savings that was supposed to be nearly as safe as cash but lacks any government guarantee. if money-market funds failed, ordinary people stood to lose huge sums, stirring wider panic. meanwhile, shares of morgan stanley and goldman sachs group, the last two freestanding investment banks, sunk as investors bet they would collapse just as their rivals had. commercial banks stopped lending to each other. the stock markets dove.it was time to act.bernanke leaned into the polycom speaker phone on his coffee table. with new york fed president timothy f. geithner and securities and exchange commission chairman christopher cox on the line, the normally mild-mannered economics professor said loudly and forcefully that the government must buy up troubled mortgage debt if there was any hope of bringing stability to the world financial system.paulson had no choice but to pull the trigger. after the conference call ended, paulson and his staff fleshed out their plan and walked one block west to the white house for a 3:30 p.m. meeting with the president. they laid out the proposal. they explained that it would almost certainly attract fierce opposition from some quarters on capitol hill. bush cut them off.the country was facing a difficult situation that required urgent action, he told paulson. don't even think about the politics, the president said. just do what you need to do.paulson and his staff turned their attention to capitol hill.the day had already been crazy in congress. few were happy with the aig deal, and a mutiny was brewing among lawmakers angry that bernanke had unilaterally committed billions of taxpayer dollars to bail out wall street speculators. a group of conservative republicans held a lengthy news conference to demand that paulson and bernanke end the ""bailout mania."" and senate majority leader harry m. reid (d-nev.) complained at a lunchtime press briefing that momentous decisions about the future of the nation's economy were being made in ""secret meetings.""""there's been far too much done, especially in the last few months, that the american people have no idea what's going on,"" reid said. a short while later, house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) called paulson's office to request an update.paulson returned the call late in the afternoon. he told her they needed to meet. immediately. he wanted to brief lawmakers from both parties and both chambers before the day was out. even as a clamor raged about bernanke's decision to rescue one firm, paulson told pelosi that he was contemplating something far bigger.the meeting was scheduled for 7 p.m. in a conference room near pelosi's office overlooking the national mall. golden light from a spectacular sunset played across the capitol's west front as the meeting convened around a long wooden conference table. pelosi sat on one side, flanked by reid and house minority leader john a. boehner (r-ohio.). paulson sat across from her, with bernanke on one side and cox on the other.paulson made brief opening remarks, then turned the floor over to bernanke.we are facing a ***financial crisis** on multiple fronts, the fed chairman said. despite our actions over the past several months, investors are still losing confidence. there's a run on the money-market funds. the last two big investment banks are under siege. the situation is severe, he said, and the fed is out of tools. if the problem isn't corrected, the united states could enter a deep multi-year ***recession** akin to sweden or japan in the early 1990s.we are headed for the worst ***financial crisis** in the nation's history, bernanke said, according to three people present. ""we're talking about a matter of days.""a pall fell over the room. ""when you listened to them describe it, you gulped,"" said sen. charles e. schumer (d-n.y.). ""history was sort of hanging over it, like this was a moment.""added sen. christopher j. dodd (d-conn.): ""we have never heard language like this.""paulson broke the silence and laid out his plan, urging lawmakers to act within the week.lawmakers began firing questions: how much would this cost?

7VDJ-S6D1-2R6N-Y005-00000-00.txt,"at yesterday's white house sponsored regional health forum in los angeles, everyone from california governor arnold schwarzenegger to celebrity doctor mehmet oz called for immediate action on health-care reform. president obama's domestic policy council director, melody barnes, said that she could ""feel the momentum"" for health reform this year.that ""momentum"" appears to be leading the administration to a brand of ""reform"" that keeps the health-care system as it was before, but with more money. the president has already injected hundreds of millions of dollars into existing programs that have proved to be inefficient and wasteful.showering more money on failed government programs is no way to reform health care. instead, real reform requires fundamentally altering the health-care marketplace by granting individual patients -- not employers, insurers, or public agencies -- direct control over their health-care dollars.in february, obama offered his first health-reform measure by drafting more kids into schip, a public insurance program originally intended to cover low-income children. together, congress and the president increased the program's federal financing by $33 billion.this is an inefficient use of scarce taxpayer dollars. for starters, schip ""crowds out"" private insurance options. many families who already have private insurance coverage for their children switch over to public coverage once schip becomes available to them.about half of those newly insured through schip -- about 2.4 million kids -- will be dropping private insurance policies. by expanding schip, the government is raiding our pockets to provide insurance to kids who already have it.second, schip eligibility is so expansive that the program now covers children from families making as much as $65,000 a year, roughly 350 percent of the federal poverty level. these families aren't super-rich. but they hardly qualify as ""low-income."" and now they're getting taxpayer-financed insurance when they likely could have afforded to buy it on their own.the president has similarly misappropriated health-care funds by lavishing $25 billion on the federal cobra program in the recent economic-stimulus package. cobra requires businesses to allow newly unemployed workers to stay on their old employer-sponsored health insurance policies after they're laid off. under the terms of the stimulus legislation, the federal government will subsidize 65 percent of the former employees' premiums.this move provides short-term relief to many who've lost their jobs during the ***recession**. but it does not address a core problem with our health-care system -- that most americans get health insurance through their employer. this outmoded system -- it began when employers, forbidden by fdr's wage controls to compete for workers by paying more, decided to provide insurance instead -- locks people into jobs and discourages the kind of entrepreneurship that makes our economy vibrant. further, businesses pay for health insurance by reducing employee compensation. the average worker with coverage through his employer is deprived of $9,000 in wages each year.instead of pouring even more money into the health-care status quo, lawmakers should deeply reform the health-care market and allow individual americans to spend their health dollars as they see fit. allowing individual consumers to purchase insurance policies with pre-tax dollars -- just as employers are able to do -- would enable millions to take charge of their own health care. such a reform would also put coverage within the reach of scores of the uninsured.when people are responsible for buying their own insurance, they have a strong incentive to shop around for the best deal. insurers will roll out new products that fit consumers' needs better than the one-size-fits-all regime common at most workplaces. and insurance policies will be for the long term, so if you lose your job, you won't be stuck with a pre-existing condition that makes you uninsurable.instead of bolstering the failed health-care system with more cash, the obama administration should re-invent the system entirely by allowing american families to reclaim their health-care dollars. unfortunately, despite the president's promises of wholesale reform, it looks like consumers will be saddled with a bulked-up version of the inefficient and government-heavy system we have today.-- john r. graham is director of health-care studies at the pacific research institute.",4/8/09,0,0,,,,0

""so, in that respect, it should take some time for the labor market to return to normal.""jobless recoveries followed the previous two ***recession**s in the early 1990s and 2000s. in the 18 months that followed the 1991 ***recession**, payroll employment increased less than 1 percent. in the same period after the 2001 ***recession**, payroll employment fell by less than 1 percent. by contrast, over the 18 months after the 1982 downturn, payroll employment rose more than 6 percent.economists are watching closely for any changes in productivity to see whether the pattern of the previous two ***recession**s will be repeated. surges in productivity followed the last two ***recession**s, making it possible for employers to postpone hiring.""if productivity growth is rapid, it means employers have discovered ways to produce more goods and services in the same hours. they don't need to add to payrolls,"" said gary burtless, an economist with the brookings institution. ""it takes a bigger increase in gdp in order to generate a robust improvement"" in unemployment.it would take a booming economy to persuade mark scott, president of mark iv builders, to put out the help-wanted sign again. he has kept his home building and remodeling firm in bethesda alive over the past 18 months by cutting his workforce from 26 to 10 people, getting rid of perks such as subsidies for continuing education courses and scrutinizing every payment that goes out the door.""we're more efficient. and the stress of that is pretty high,"" he said. ""can we do it long term? i guess we have to do it as long as we can.""a jobless recovery is not necessarily inevitable, said robert shimer, an economist at the university of chicago, who noted that the last two ***recession** were much milder than the current one. the ***recession** of the early 1980s, which is closest in severity and duration to the current one, was followed by strong job growth. ""why should we be sure that [the current downturn] will look more like the recent episodes?"" he said.some employers are gearing up to hire again. jim zawacki, the owner of gr spring &amp; stamping, an auto supplier based in grand rapids, mich., has had to lay off a third of his workforce, slash the workweek from 40 to 32 hours, give up his company car and take an 80 percent salary cut. but he has been able to pick up business from other competitors that have gone under. he said he could start hiring if business that has been booked for later in the year comes through.""as long as [customers] don't cancel or slow down . . . we should start seeing [improvement] in september,"" he said.jobless recoveries might be easier to predict if economists better understood their causes. for now, theories abound. some economists suggest such recoveries have something to do with structural shifts in the economy; others blame the burden of rising health-care costs on employers.this ***recession** has its own quirks that lead some economists to think a jobless recovery is more likely.the economy has shed more than 6 million jobs since the downturn began in december 2007. taking population growth into account, the economy will have to add about 8.8 million jobs to restore employment to pre-***recession** levels, the economic policy institute has estimated. but many of the usual engines of economic growth are stalled. businesses have more capacity -- equipment, locations, inventory -- than they know what to do with and thus little reason to invest. consumers who have lost a record amount of wealth have shut their wallets. the global slump means less demand for u.s. exports.in addition, the collapse of the housing market has also slowed migration in the united states, which in the past has helped bring down unemployment as workers relocate for jobs, said harvard economist larry katz. falling home prices have made it harder to sell and forced more people to stay put. and the housing meltdown has hurt sun belt economies such as florida and california that until recently were a haven for rust belt refugees.the ***recession** has also produced a record number of so-called ""involuntary"" part-timers who would work more hours if they could. that could delay hiring, economists say, because employers tend to increase hours of existing employees before adding workers.scott, the owner of mark iv, said that is what he will do if business picks up.

***economic crisis** and the election of barack obama will change the future of higher education. even as universities, both public and private, face unanticipated financial constraints, the president has called on them to assist in solving problems from health care delivery to climate change to economic recovery.  american universities have long struggled to meet almost irreconcilable demands: to be practical as well as transcendent; to assist immediate national needs and to pursue knowledge for its own sake; to both add value and question values. and in the past decade and a half, such conflicting and unbounded expectations have yielded a wave of criticism on issues ranging from the cost of college to universities' intellectual quality to their supposed decline into unthinking political correctness. a steady stream of books -- among them ''declining by degrees: higher education at risk'' (also a pbs special), edited by richard h. hersh and john merrow; anthony t. kronman's ''education's end: why our colleges and universities have given up on the meaning of life''; and dinesh d'souza's ''illiberal education: the politics of race and sex on campus'' -- have delineated what various authors have seen as the failings of higher education.   at the same time, american colleges and universities have remained the envy of the world. a 2005 international ranking included 17 american educational institutions in the top 20, and a recent survey of american citizens revealed that 93 percent of respondents considered our universities one of the country's ''most valuable resources.''   such a widespread perception of the value of universities derives in no small part from very pragmatic realities: a college education yields significant rewards. the median earnings for individuals with a b.a. are 74 percent higher than for workers who possess only a high school diploma.   in some respects, this is not new. education has been central to the american dream since the time of the nation's founding. but in the years since world war ii, it was higher education, not just instruction at the elementary or high school levels, that emerged as necessary for a technologically skilled work force as well as fundamental to cherished values of opportunity. as late as the 1920s, enrollments in the united states stood below 5 percent of the college-age population. they rose to about 15 percent by 1949, in part as a result of the g.i. bill. they have now reached nearly 60 percent. the united states has pioneered a new postwar era of mass college attendance that has become global in reach.   but today, for all its importance to individual and social prosperity, higher education threatens to become less broadly available. by the end of the 20th century, as claudia goldin and lawrence f. katz document in ''the race between education and technology,'' the rate of increase in educational attainment had significantly slowed, and the united states had fallen behind a number of other nations in the percentage of its youth attending college. goldin and katz demonstrate how this slowdown is creating a work force with inadequate technological abilities, as well as contributing to rising levels of american inequality.  escalating college costs have played a significant role in this slowdown, even as universities have substantially expanded their programs of financial aid. so, too, have declining levels of government support.  after world war ii, the country witnessed the establishment of a new partnership between washington and the nation's institutions of higher learning, with the federal government investing in universities as the primary locus for the nation's scientific research. this model now faces significant challenges. steep federal deficits will combine with diminished university resources to intensify what a 2007 report by the national academies declared to be a ''gathering storm,'' one that threatened the future of scientific education and research in america. the obama administration has set a goal of devoting more than 3 percent of gross domestic product to research. one hopes this highly ambitious aspiration can become a reality.   the ***economic downturn** has had what is perhaps an even more worrisome impact. it has reinforced america's deep-seated notion that a college degree serves largely instrumental purposes. the federal government's first effort to support higher education, the morrill act of 1862, which established land grant colleges, was intended to advance the ''practical education of the industrial classes.'' a department of education report from 2006, ''a test of leadership: charting the future of higher education,'' concentrated on creating a competitive american work force and advancing ''our collective prosperity.'' but even as we as a nation have embraced education as critical to economic growth and opportunity, we should remember that colleges and universities are about a great deal more than measurable utility. unlike perhaps any other institutions in the world, they embrace the long view and nurture the kind of critical perspectives that look far beyond the present.   higher education is not about results in the next quarter but about discoveries that may take -- and last -- decades or even centuries. neither the abiding questions of humanistic inquiry nor the winding path of scientific research that leads ultimately to innovation and discovery can be neatly fitted within a predictable budget and timetable.   in an assessment of the condition of higher education in the anglo-american world, ''multiversities, ideas, and democracy,'' george fallis, a former dean at york university in toronto, deplores the growing dominance of economic justifications for universities. they conflict, he argues, ''with other parts of the multiversity's mission, with . . . narratives of liberal learning, disinterested scholarship and social citizenship.'' university leaders, he observes, have embraced a market model of university purpose to justify themselves to the society that supports them with philanthropy and tax dollars. higher education, fallis insists, has the responsibility to serve not just as a source of economic growth, but as society's critic and conscience.  universities are meant to be producers not just of knowledge but also of (often inconvenient) doubt. they are creative and unruly places, homes to a polyphony of voices. but at this moment in our history, universities might well ask if they have in fact done enough to raise the deep and unsettling questions necessary to any society.   as the world indulged in a bubble of false prosperity and excessive materialism, should universities -- in their research, teaching and writing -- have made greater efforts to expose the patterns of risk and denial? should universities have presented a firmer counterweight to economic irresponsibility? have universities become too captive to the immediate and worldly purposes they serve? has the market model become the fundamental and defining identity of higher education?  since the 1970s there has been a steep decline in the percentage of students majoring in the liberal arts and sciences, and an accompanying increase in preprofessional undergraduate degrees. business is now by far the most popular undergraduate major, with twice as many bachelor's degrees awarded in this area than in any other field of study. in the era of economic constraint before us, the pressure toward vocational pursuits is likely only to intensify.   as a nation, we need to ask more than this from our universities. higher learning can offer individuals and societies a depth and breadth of vision absent from the inevitably myopic present. human beings need meaning, understanding and perspective as well as jobs. the question should not be whether we can afford to believe in such purposes

washington counties are probably also in a ***recession**.but local economic development experts, who know times are getting tough, also know one area's economy isn't always an exact reflection of the state's.\""regionally, we are feeling the pinch,\"" said peter wohl, empire state development corp.capital region director. \""but we have some very encouraging micro economies.\""one reason we're feeling the pinch is unemployment, which has been increasing in every county across the state.\""there's been a pretty broad-based loss in jobs,\"" said jim ross, an analyst for the state department of labor who concentrates on the capital district.\""the only private sector that's seeing much growth is health care.\"" the glens falls metropolitan statistical area lost 1,300 nonfarm jobs between july 2007 and july 2008, according to labor department data. similarly, private sector jobs decreased by 1,500 in this area, which includes warren and washington counties. as such, the unemployment rate in the glens falls msa rose from 3.8 percent in july 2007 to 4.9 percent in july 2008. while this clearly indicates economic hardship, the state as a whole is worse off in terms of the number of people without jobs. statewide, unemployment rose from 4.9 percent to 5.4 percent between july 2007 and 2008.in saratoga county, the situation is somewhat better than it is in the glens falls area.according to data from the state department of labor, unemployment in saratoga county was at 4.4 percent in july 2008. that's up from 3.6 percent during the same period last year.\""in terms of unemployment, saratoga's got one of the lowest in the state,\"" ross said. \""this is partially because of the track. \""the glens falls metropolitan statistical area is also below the state, partially because of summer tourism,\"" he added. \""there are seasonal factors at play here.\""year-round jobs, however, may also contribute to the area's lower unemployment rate.\""we have fairly stable employment in this market,\"" said tom hoy, chairman, president and ceo of arrow financial corp. \""we don't have a lot of cyclical industries, though years ago we were more reliant on cyclical industries.\""our medical device industry, for instance, is driven by something other than typical economic cycles,\"" he continued. \""there's an ever-growing demand for medical devices.\""this ever-growing demand means companies like angiodynamics inc. and c.r. bard aren't likely to downsize -- and that's an encouraging sign for the micro economy of the greater glens falls area. another encouraging sign is the export of local goods produced in washington county.\""the manufacturing in our area, much of what's made is exported outside the area,\"" mark galough said. \""so we're not completely dependent on what's going on in this immediate region.\""we've got some defense contractors dealing with the federal government who do a lot of exporting to asia,\"" he added. \""as the economy booms over there, they're importing what we're sending out.\"" the post-star spoke with galough in late july when he was executive director of the washington county local development corp. galough has since accepted a new position at glens falls national bank.the relative stability provided by exporters and medical device makers, however, doesn't mean the area's immune to the effects of the ***recession**. \""it does have an impact on everybody,\"" said peter aust, president of the chamber of southern saratoga county. \""gas prices have had an impact, food costs are really starting to impact people. \""we are hearing locally that things are getting a little tight,\"" he added. \""some restaurants are seeing less business, they're off 15 to 20 percent compared to last year.\""aust attributed this dip to the dip in tourism. in saratoga county, for instance, attendance at the track has been down, he said. \""and when you don't have regular tourism traffic, that affects the restaurant business.\""year-round residents, too, might not be going out to dinner as much, aust added.while a drop in business can be discouraging and challenging, it seems some local restaurateurs were prepared for the decline. \""they're saying, 'we're down, but we anticipated this,' \"" aust said. \""they're saying, 'we didn't hire as many people, so we're ok.' \"" there are also businesses that are doing better than ok. \""i'm hearing from other members, like auto repair shops and movie rental companies, that their business is increasing,\"" aust said. \""people are saying, 'i'm not going to buy a new car, i'm going to fix the one i have.' \"" all this leads aust to believe that while the local economy isn't as healthy as it could be, it's also not as bad as it could be. hoy agrees, partly because of the separation between upstate and downstate new york.\""new york city, from a housing and economic perspective, is so heavily influenced by the success of the financial district in manhattan,\"" he said. \""all the major problems they're having with that district have a huge impact on the downstate economy. but upstate, by virtue of being somewhat stagnant for the last several years, didn't have this big housing boom or an inflation in housing prices,\"" hoy continued. \""as a result, we didn't have a bubble to break, so there wasn't an opportunity for our economy to drop that much.\"" hoy's not oblivious to the reality that life and business will get more difficult before they get easier, however.he's anticipating bumps in the road, but he's also confident those bumps won't turn into roadblocks.\""i am expecting things to be somewhat more challenging going forward, that's a likely scenario, but i'm not expecting major problems,\"" hoy said. \""we've gone through this before in this community.\"" the ***recession** of 1974, in particular, stands out in hoy's memory. \""unemployment was very high,\"" he said. \""the dow jones industrial (average) went through 1000 in 1972 and it never got back to 1000 until 1980 or 1981.\""this time around, hoy added, things don't look as bad.to see more of the post-star, or to subscribe to the

""in the long run, you have to hope that competitive sales return."" the worldwide freezing of credit since august 2007 and the longest ***economic slowdown** since the great depression ""may have further emboldened bankers to press even harder for negotiated"" offerings, said patrick p. born, chief financial officer for minneapolis.

4NF8-PGX0-TWDC-M27T-00000-00.txt,"now that a legal sideshow has ended, it's time for the main event -- restoring fiscal health to the ailing retirement system for san diego county's public employees.although national attention has centered on the financial shenanigans inside san diego's city government, some politicians would love to have the public forget that the county's pension system is in trouble, too.for starters, the county retirement fund is deeply in debt. in 2002 county supervisors approved a dramatic increase in pension payments to retirees. the decision was unbelievably short-sighted, as it came on the heels of a ***recession** and sagging investment markets.in 2001, the fund ran a $239 million surplus. today the fund's obligations to current and future retirees exceeds its projected reserves by $1.23 billion. yet the real debt is closer to $2.4 billion, because the county borrowed $1.2 billion to shore up the fund.under california law, taxpayers are on the hook for government pensions. if a shortfall jeopardizes pension checks, lawmakers must slash services, raise taxes, or both.recently, the board of supervisors woke up to the fiscal danger and voted to trim retiree health insurance subsidies. the move would preserve health insurance subsidies for workers who retired before the 2002 pension increase, and still free up $1.2 billion over 20 years to return the pension fund to fiscal stability.supervisors dianne jacob and pam slater-price get credit for crafting the turn-around plan, which is a model for debt-ridden governments across california.however, it is being resisted by the independent board that runs the county pension system.remember that this board's fiduciary duty has always been to watch over the pension nest egg for county employees. but, in better fiscal times, the board decided to use any surplus for a generous health insurance benefit.over the years, the benefit grew to dwarf those of private-sector taxpayers who must foot the bill. a county employee can retire early, say at 55, and receive $400 a month for health insurance until medicare kicks in at 65. then he gets $300 a month for supplemental coverage -- for life. must be nice.now, with a fiscal crisis upon them, some members of the pension board refuse to scale back health subsidies, which, unlike pension benefits, can legally be eliminated.the position is reckless, but it operates under a certain logic: with taxpayers on the hook, why not run a pension deficit -- and keep an optional health benefit?jacob, who represents the county on the pension board, has voted for fiscal sanity. so board members tried to heave her off the board. this week a judge ruled in jacob's favor.to their credit, the supervisors say they will halt taxpayer payments for health care by june 30 unless the pension board accepts their restructuring plan. so far, the board seems bent on a showdown, thus risking benefits for all retirees instead of compromising to help older retirees.the board must remember its duty -- secure pensions.",4/5/07,0,0,,,,0
7WJB-20J1-2PG5-500J-00000-00.txt,"c(""apina@projo.com / (401) 277-7465"", ""east providence   the city s teachers have voted to withdraw from volunteer activities in the district s schools.the roughly 500 educators won t help with afterschool activities except for those that are accompanied with paid stipends, nor will they chaperone dances, buy supplies for their classrooms or participate on committees for curriculum development, accreditation or school improvement.the changes are effective immediately and will affect all of the city s 13 schools. school begins sept. 9. we re continuing all our contractual obligations and beyond,  said valarie lawson, the president of the local teachers union, east providence education association. the union adopted the policy at a monday membership meeting. this is not work to rule,  said east providence high school history teacher greg amore, a member of the committee that developed the teachers  plan. when teacher unions vote to do only what is contractually necessary, it is considered  work to rule  in education circles.the city s teachers, however, will continue to write letters of recommendation for students, meet and talk with parents and be involved with parent-teacher organizations. they will also continue to offer afterschool help, coach sports teams, correct papers and plan lessons at home, and participate in all paid extracurricular activities.within hours of being announced, the plan drew an expression of concern from education commissioner deborah a. gist. i do understand the many challenges and expectations that educators face,  gist told a meeting of the state board of regents thursday afternoon.  however, i want to be clear that i do not believe it is ever appropriate for educators to make decisions that directly impact students. the teachers have been without a contract since oct. 31, 2008. negotiations broke down before that and mediation and arbitration didn t resolve anything. in january, the school committee voted to unilaterally cut teacher salaries nearly 5 percent and force the educators to pay 20 percent toward their health-care costs.other changes included decreased pay increments for advanced degrees and eliminating health-care coverage for teachers who can get coverage through another employer or a spouse s employer. to protect their insurance, teachers had to sign an affidavit by aug. 31 if they couldn t get insurance elsewhere.the union has challenged the action in the courts and before the state labor relations board. rulings and decisions have yet to be made.amore said the union s new plan is  kid-friendly.  it has been named p.r.i.d.e., which stands for professional response initiative dedicated educators. as educators, we take a lot of pride in what we do,  lawson said.  we don t think east providence s officials, the school committee and city council value our time and our efforts. school committee chairman anthony carcieri said the measure is nothing more than work to rule guised with a different name. we certainly hope that the teachers in east providence will refuse to make the kids pawns in this union s game,  carcieri said in a thursday news release.  the idea that the union s response to the city s ***financial crisis** is to order its members to punish our school children is repugnant to me. district lawyer dan kinder said,  it s a particularly vicious kind of strike. it s aimed squarely at the kids. the teachers  unions do these things so they don t lose any pay while they re withholding services, and so the courts won t order them back to work. with a regular strike, they don t get paid, and the courts will issue injunctions to stop them. carcieri also said the committee s cost-cutting actions this year were the  democratic process  at work. our schools were crumbling,  he said.  they couldn t pay their bills. education had been cut to the bone. our kids weren t even computer literate. the voters insisted on change. we had to turn things around, and we had to start with the deficit. there was no money for education if we couldn t get the debt under control. the teachers  union wouldn t agree to help, so we had to act.  amore, lawson and history teacher michael silva said teachers lost an average of $6,000 or more because of the changes and some have had to get second jobs to make ends meet. they also said some  are on the verge of losing their homes  because of it. we have thousands and thousands of man-hours that have been given freely,  amore said.  we consider it part of what we do. for example, mike [silva] and i spent hours aligning social studies standards on our own time because we thought we were appreciated, but i guess that s not the case. in addition to the time, silva said some teachers can t afford buying supplies for the students anymore. they say teachers previously spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars of their own money.amore, lawson and silva insist the initiative will  not hurt the children s education  because they say central administration staff and administrators  who are paid much more than us  can step up and fill the gap so dances and other unfunded programs can continue.when asked how they thought parents and residents would respond to the p.r.i.d.e. initiative, amore said,  i think they ll understand. we have all been affected by the economy. said silva,  and i think the parents will be appreciative that their children s education will not be adversely affected.

""we told them no one lost any money, and it’s business as usual,"" valdez said.  customers should notice no change in the transfer because checks, atm cards and online banking services will remain the same, said steve aughenbaugh, state bank of lincoln president, in a statement issued late thursday afternoon. warner was among six illinois banks, all controlled by one family, taken over by the fdic on thursday. the founding warner family of clinton sold the bank in 2003. the closings bring to 12 the number of illinois banks closed this year. as of april 30, warner had total assets of $70 million and total deposits of approximately $64 million.  in addition to assuming all the warner deposits, the lincoln bank agreed to buy about $63 million of assets. the fdic will retain the remaining assets for later disposition. the cost of the bank failure to the fdic’s insurance fund is estimated to be about $10 million. in may, warner was ranked as undercapitalized by snl financial, a research firm covering the banking industry. an fdic team and a state regulator went into warner at closing time at 3 p.m. thursday to initiate the transition, valdez said.  ""obviously, it was a shock, a trauma"" to employees, she said. forty people from the fdic’s dallas office will work through the weekend with bank employees to complete the transition, including balancing all accounts and inventorying all loans, valdez said. ""they’ve jumped right in - they’re troupers,"" she said the bank’s 26 full- and part-time employees. the clinton bank was going to be closed today for the holiday, but the lincoln bank decided to open the clinton bank facilities after all, said valdez. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- john warner bank ? founded: 1867 as john warner and co. with initial capitalization of $50,000. it incorporated in 1911 as a state bank and assumed its present name. in 1947, the bank qualified with the state to act as a trust company. ? location: southeast corner of the square, clinton ? highlights: installed county's first drive-up windows (1956); constructed television drive-up across adams street with pneumatic tubes (1972); installed first atm in the bank's foyer (1983); expanded into the second story to house its trust, farm management, and loan departments (1988); introduced jwb telebank to provide customers with account information by phone (1992); opened first branch, in clinton iga (1996); introduced jwb checkcard as debit card (1996); introduced the john warner bank online (2000). source: johnwarnerbank.com state bank of lincoln? founded: sept. 4, 1903; doors opened jan. 16, 1904. ? locations: 508 broadway (main office); state bank west, 818 woodlawn road, lincoln (1979); cornland banking center, day and locust streets, cornland (1990); sangamon street facility, 111 n. sangamon, lincoln (1992); fifth location inside wal-mart supercenter (2007). source: sblincoln.com ",7/3/09,1,1,,,,1

7VFW-7TS0-Y8TC-S4K1-00000-00.txt,"skinny, weathered peasants gathered berries falling from a butter tree as rahul gandhi, heir apparent to the governing indian national congress, drove across these baked plains, part of a hectic campaign tour to pitch his party as champions of the poor.  at every campaign stop, mr. gandhi, 38, fourth-generation scion of the country's premier political dynasty, rattles off antipoverty programs begun by the congress-led coalition government: a law that promises 100 days of employment to the poor, greater financing for schools, major debt forgiveness for farmers. more largess  is forthcoming, he says, if voters return congress to power in national elections that start on thursday.  exactly what will happen when india's 714 million eligible voters head to the polls in the world's biggest exercise in democracy is difficult to forecast, this year even more than in the past. few dare to predict what unwieldy coalition may  replace the one that has presided since 2004.  but one thing is certain. the next government will confront tough choices as it seeks to balance the need to spur economic growth, which is slowing down for the first time in a decade, with the need to address the anxieties of india's poor.   three economic stimulus packages have widened india's fiscal deficit to some of the highest levels since it  began opening its socialist economy in the early 1990s, and western credit rating agencies say a raft of new spending promises by congress and other parties threatens the country's already low credit rating.   prime minister manmohan singh, a former economics professor, defended his government's borrowing plan this week, saying that it was necessary to stimulate the economy and ''to soften the harsh edges of extreme poverty.'' more than 40 percent of indians live below the world bank poverty line of $1.25 a day.  mr. singh led the opening of the indian economy as finance minister in 1991. but his congress-led government has, by its own admission, taken the slow road on structural reforms, even as it has enjoyed an average 9 percent growth during its tenure. congress's critics point out that even highway construction, widely accepted as critical to  india's  economic growth, has slowed.   some economists worry that another fragile coalition would be hard pressed to further liberalize the economy, particularly on measures like expanding foreign investment in banking and insurance. others warn that the next government will  have to choose more carefully between populist giveaways and measures that genuinely kick-start the economy.   mr. gandhi's party, for its part, has congratulated itself for having insulated india somewhat from the impact of the worldwide ***recession**. india has relied less on exports to generate growth, protected its farmers and relegated foreign banks to the margins of its financial system.   ''we are seen as having bucked the trend'' of global contagion, mr. gandhi said in an interview, by moving more slowly toward an open economy than neighboring china and other asian economies. sonia gandhi, rahul's mother and the president of the congress party, recently hailed her mother-in-law,  indira gandhi, for having nationalized the country's banks as prime minister in the 1970s.  today, in an intensely competitive political environment, every party promises benefits. both congress and its principal opposition, the bharatiya janata party, offer hugely subsidized rice, the staple grain. a southern regional party, the telugu desam party, promises cash to women below the poverty line. the b.j.p. promises to spend heavily on building roads and highways. kumari mayawati, the dalit outcaste leader of this state, uttar pradesh, the most populous in india, promises an expansion of set-asides in government jobs.   these are campaign promises, subject to the horse-trading that will begin after the election results are announced on may 16.   neither congress nor the b.j.p., the two largest parties, has won a majority of seats in the 543-member parliament in nearly 20 years. they are not expected to this time. new alliances will have to be stitched.  there is even a slim chance that the smaller parties, each representing the aspirations of india's many regions and castes, could cobble together a so-called third front government, leaving the two national parties on the sidelines.   no matter who the next leaders are, chances are there will be no radical moves either way. in this campaign season, no one is seriously proposing to seal off the indian economy from the outside world. no one is campaigning for radical structural reforms, either. no one ever does at election time.   ''economic reform is pursued by stealth,'' meghnad desai, an economist, wrote recently in tehelka, a weekly newsmagazine.   the chances of allowing greater foreign investment in, say, banking or insurance, are small, as are those of slimming down a government bureaucracy, said laveesh bhandari, who runs a nonpartisan economic research firm, indicus analytics, in new delhi.   the next administration could find it easier to spend on infrastructure and social welfare, including on things like improving education and health, which economists say could fuel india's economic advance. ''yes, its fiscal space is limited, and that's why it has got to make hard choices,'' said dipak dasgupta, lead economist for india at the world bank in new delhi. ''democracy will probably end up taking it in the right direction.''  rajeev chandrasekhar, a member of the unelected upper house of parliament who runs an investment company called jupiter, argued that deeper reforms would get on the agenda only if economic prospects deteriorated sharply. india, he noted, began opening up its economy in 1991, only when the government's foreign exchange was nearly depleted. ''india responds best in times of crisis,'' he said.   as mr. gandhi drove through the countryside on his recent campaign tour, his well-wishers showered his car with rose petals. the scorching air grew fragrant for a moment. he and sonia, the italian-born party chief, waved from inside.   ''we feel that we need to hold the hands of the poor people,'' mr. gandhi said at a rally earlier in the week. at another, he chided the opposition for focusing on the stock market.   across rural india, acts of god and government have saved the people from ruin in recent years. the rains have been good. the fields heave with wheat ready for harvest. the ***economic crisis** is not felt in these parts, as it is in india's globalized cities, and this is where most of the votes are.

7WT0-99J0-Y9J0-Y4SX-00000-00.txt,"c(""oct. 3--prepare to bundle up this winter -- and those in the coming decades. west virginia was hit with a series of threats last week that foreshadow much higher energy costs now, and in the future.yes, wednesday, sept. 30 -- perhaps one day to be known as black wednesday -- dawned cool and overcast across southern west virginia. but events in play in charleston and washington prompted an even drearier forecast on the horizon.the first warning came with the release of a climate change legislation draft by a u.s. senate committee. we know it as cap and trade. democrats, however, are rebranding it as pollution reduction and investment, or pri. cap and trade, it seems, has developed a bad name. people think of it as a tax because it will raise energy costs. while changing the name of the bill will not alter the cost of the legislation to working families -- and coal economies -- sen. john kerry, author of the bill, believes it will \""refocus attention on what the bill would do, not how it goes about doing it,\"" according to an associated press report.of course, it will still go about reducing pollution by increasing costs -- either moderately or dramatically, depending on which experts one chooses to believe -- but we're not supposed to think about that. the time to worry will be years down the road, when high costs leave senior citizens and working families shivering in the cold, and coal-heavy economies, such as those in southern west virginia and southwest virginia, are emaciated by the current leadership's strong-arm tactics to force this country to follow its course -- despite the costs and consequences.bottom line: the senate version of the cap-and-trade bill aims to reduce greenhouse gases by 20 percent in 2020. that's 3 percent more than the house version of the bill, which sparked outrage across the two virginias.but there was more in the works on black wednesday. also that day, the environmental protection agency announced plans to restrict greenhouse gas emissions from industrial facilities, including factories and power plants.greenhouse gas, as we all know, means carbon dioxide, which is produced by the burning of fossil fuels -- including the black gold that permeates the coalfields.\""we are not going to continue with business as usual any longer. we have the tools and the technology to move forward today, and we are using them,\"" lisa jackson, administrator of the environmental protection agency, was quoted in an ap story.on the other side of the issue was sen. james inhofe, r-okla., who said the epa's plan \""will grind economic growth to a halt in cities and communities across america.\""that's a cheery thought in today's already depressed economy. and i, too, am having a difficult time understanding the logic of imposing stricter and costlier regulations to businesses who are already struggling from the ***recession**. common sense and history tell us that businesses tend to pass higher costs on to consumers.so if two plus two traditionally equals four, the very same consumers who may soon be paying higher energy costs due to the formerly-known-as-cap-and-trade legislation could also face higher costs on any number of items produced by factories, as well as the electricity that powers their homes.and, to make matters worse, there was black wednesday's third devastating news report: the rate hike granted to american electric power by west virginia's public service commission.the 12.1 percent increase for this year, which was implemented immediately, was a result of the largest ever rate hike request in state history -- $442 million or 43 percent. aep later dropped this request to $397.8 million. the psc's ruling was an immediate increase of $355 million to be implemented over four years. in other words, expect the power bill to go up and up and up and up until around 2013.by that time, we might be feeling the impact of the cap-and-trade bill.the house version of this bill was estimated to raise costs by $125 per household a year, according to the congressional budget office. but remember, the house version called for a lower reduction of greenhouse gas emissions than sen. kerry's senate bill. and it's also important to note that many believed the initial $125 per household figure was a low estimate.there is one other contributing factor in the ultimate realization of much higher energy costs to us all. rounding out black wednesday, president obama's administration halted applications for 79 surface mine permits in four states, including west virginia. these mountaintop mines produce about 130 million tons of coal a year, the majority of which goes to generate electricity.whether one agrees or disagrees with the practice of mountaintop mining, it would be naive to think the administration's decision to halt the permits will not eventually have an affect on the checks we write to our power company each month.for the two virginias, the message sent by the washington administration last week was clear: coal is not a part of america's future.although our fossil fuel has powered this nation for decades, cemented its steel infrastructure and helped it win wars against evil regimes, suddenly it seems we are no longer needed for its future growth.heaven help this

7VV9-VH51-2PBB-2025-00000-00.txt,"treasury secretary timothy f. geithner ended his first visit to china on tuesday by saying that his meetings here had begun to lay the foundation for greater cooperation between washington and beijing on a wide range of issues, including the global finance and climate change.  mr. geithner held high-level talks on tuesday with some of china's top leaders, including president hu jintao and prime minister wen jiabao, and said in an interview that beijing had not lost faith in the united states economy.''what i sense is a fair amount of confidence in the underlying strength of the american economy,'' mr. geithner told reporters in a tuesday morning briefing.  the visit came amid growing worries in china over the state of the american economy and the prospect that heavy government spending and ballooning deficits in the united states could eventually weaken the dollar and destroy the value of china's extensive united states treasury holdings.  china is the largest holder of american debt and experts say that any move by beijing to slow its purchases of united states treasury bills could deepen and prolong the global ***recession**. some chinese economists have called on beijing to significantly reduce purchases of american debt. the head of china's central bank has even proposed that there be an alternative to the dollar for international currency reserves.  in pushing for greater cooperation with beijing this week, mr. geithner seemed to take a softer tone than some of his predecessors in the bush administration. he failed to raise any contentious issues in public this week, and continuously praised beijing's efforts to manage and stimulate its economy. he also largely avoided any discussion of intellectual property piracy or revaluing the chinese currency, and said he would press for a greater role for china in the international monetary fund.  asked why, he said, ''i just see it as the necessary evolution.'' then, he added, ''it's more catch-up.''  trying to assuage fears about the united states deficit, mr. geithner also promised that once the american economy recovers, the obama administration is determined to reign in spending and tackle the deficit.  ''as we recover from this unprecedented crisis, we will cut our fiscal deficit,'' he said.  at a peking university speech on monday, mr. geithner outlined a broad set of initiatives aimed at rebalancing the global economy. following the analysis of some leading global economists, he said the united states needs to save more and consume less, and he called on china to strengthen its economy by moving away from an export driven model to one that relied more on domestic consumption.  ''how successful we are in washington and beijing will be critically important to the economic fortunes of the rest of the world,'' he said.  analysts say the new treasury secretary is clearly interested in pressing american interests in china, on copyright issues, greater access to china's financial markets and the sale of american clean energy technologies. he used a visit to the beijing capital museum tuesday afternoon to highlight climate change as an important part of the upcoming dialogues with beijing and to show off american-produced solar panels.  but some experts say mr. geithner is also trying to earn the confidence of the leadership so that washington can find more ways to cooperate on major global issues.  late tuesday, treasury officials announced that in the last week of july washington plans to host the first meeting of the strategic and economic dialogue, a broad set of high level talks with beijing. mr. geithner and secretary of state hillary rodham clinton are expected to host their chinese counterparts for a series of meetings quite similar to those former treasury secretary henry m. paulson jr. established a few years ago.  yu yongding, a former adviser to china's central bank and a member of the china academy of social sciences, said washington needs to win beijing's confidence by protecting china's investments in american debt and helping reform the global financial system.  ''if the u.s. can find a way to protect china's assets, america's standing here will increase,'' mr. yu said in an interview monday.

7WB0-5FW0-Y8TC-S05V-00000-00.txt,"lloyd c. blankfein has a story about the cataclysm that nearly brought down all of wall street. it goes something like this: one by one, lesser banks were swept away by the financial storm of 2008. and as the floodwaters rose, no one, not even goldman sachs, seemed safe.  the question, in mr. blankfein's eyes, was how high the water would rise. but washington stepped in with all those bailouts before the surge reached goldman.  the story, which was recounted by several friends and colleagues, represents a sobering private admission from mr. blankfein, goldman's chief executive.  publicly, it is a different story. now that goldman is minting money again, the bank insists that it was never in any real danger. mr. blankfein, in an e-mail message this week, disputed his private account, saying goldman's survival was never in doubt. other goldman executives reject the notion that the bank was rescued at all.   ''we did not have a near-death experience,'' said gary d. cohn, goldman's president. the government saved the financial industry as a whole, but it did not save goldman sachs, he said.  rarely has the view from inside a company been so at odds with the view outside it. could goldman sachs have lived if all those other giant banks had failed? could it alone survive financial armageddon?   goldman executives are dismissive, even defiant, when critics argue that the bank is playing a heads-we-win, tails-you-lose game with american taxpayers. and yet the questions keep coming. last month the story of goldman's postcrisis success -- and conspiracy theories surrounding it -- leapt from the business pages to the cover of rolling stone.   the idea that nothing has changed for goldman sachs strikes many outsiders as absurd. in this era of mega-bailouts, goldman is widely perceived, on wall street and in washington, as too big and important to fail. if its bets pay off, goldman profits and its employees get rich. if its bets go bad, ultimately taxpayers will have to pick up the bill.   ''many observers on the market believe that goldman and others of its size now have a free insurance policy,'' said elizabeth warren, the chairwoman of the congressional oversight panel for the $700 billion bailout fund. ''whether they do or not is less important than the fact that many in the market believe they do. that means at some level goldman is playing with the american taxpayers' future.''  is goldman gambling at america's expense? of course not, mr. cohn said. should it change its business strategy in the wake of the gravest ***financial crisis** since the depression? no. is goldman taking big risks to make big profits? courting more outrage over wall street pay with its plans to pay lavish bonuses? throwing its weight around in washington?   no, no, no.   goldman executives dispute suggestions that high-stakes market gambles are behind its big profits -- $3.4 billion in the second quarter. and they are dumbfounded when people like ms. warren suggest companies like goldman, which paid back its bailout money last month, now operate with an implicit taxpayer guarantee.   after so many wrenching changes on wall street and in the economy, it might come as a surprise that the post-bailout goldman is virtually indistinguishable from the pre-bailout one.   the bank has strengthened its capital base and reduced its use of leverage -- the borrowed money that turbo-charges profits on the way up and can prove devastating on the way down. but goldman sees little reason to change the way it does business. in fact, its executives are surprised that anyone would suggest it should.   even goldman's conversion to a traditional banking company at the height of the crisis -- a step many predicted would clip goldman's gilded wings -- has been deftly sidestepped.   it is, in other words, business as usual at goldman -- and what a business it is. quarter after quarter, wall street executives scour goldman's results hoping to figure out how the bank makes so much money. mr. cohn and other executives, in recent interviews, sketched the broad outlines of an answer. mr. blankfein declined to be interviewed for this article.  during the second quarter, goldman bet, correctly, that the financial markets would calm down. it wagered that market volatility would decline and that certain securities tied to the troubled home mortgage market would revive. its securities underwriting business bounced back too.  a vast majority of profits came from trading on behalf of clients like big mutual funds, pension funds and endowments, rather than from staking goldman's own money in the markets, mr. cohn said. proprietary trading now accounts for about 10 percent of profits, down from 20 percent in 2005. goldman dominated institutional trades linked to changes in a closely watched stock market index, the russell 2000, and is benefiting because old competitors like bear stearns and lehman brothers are no longer around.   ''we don't have to outsmart the market today,'' said mr. cohn. ''we just have to do what our clients want us to do.''  but unlike some of its rivals, goldman is not shy about taking risks. the bank stood to lose as much as $245 million on any given day during the second quarter, based on a common measure known as value at risk, or var. that was up from $184 million in mid-2008. but var captures only about a fifth of goldman's market risks and excludes investments that are difficult to value.  ''our risk appetite continues to grow year on year, quarter on quarter, as our balance sheet and liquidity continue to grow,'' mr. cohn said. he and other executives say goldman carefully manages its risks, which, for the most part, it has.   goldman's latest quarterly disclosures to the securities and exchange commission, filed on wednesday, provide another glimpse into the bank's activities. aided by cheap credit, goldman generated more than $100 million in daily revenue from trading on 46 separate days during the second quarter -- a record.  since late 2007, goldman has reduced its exposure to illiquid investments, which can pose dangers because they are traded so infrequently, by 8 percent. its total exposure to these so-called level 3 assets still stood at $50.4 billion. while var is up, other risk measures were down, and the bank's capital base has grown significantly. lately, goldman has been taking more risks in stocks, but fewer in fixed income, currency and commodities.   some of goldman's recent practices are drawing scrutiny from government officials. in its filing wednesday, goldman said various government agencies had inquired about its compensation practices, as well as its role in the market for credit derivatives, which fueled the ***financial crisis**.   but over all, the events of the past year have not changed the way goldman views or manages the risks it takes, said david a. viniar, goldman's chief financial officer.   ''there are a few business units that are taking a little more risk. most are taking less,'' mr. viniar said.   mr. cohn, goldman's president, acknowledges his bank is systemically important, meaning that its failure would probably send financial shock waves around the world. but he said that the implications of this status were unclear and that goldman had no government backing.   david a. moss, a professor at harvard business school, disagrees. he says the painful lessons of the ***financial crisis** show the federal government now stands behind all systemically important financial institutions.  ''we're in a situation where we've extended important guarantees, both explicit and implicit, to almost all major financial institutions, yet we don't have the regulations in place to control the excessive risk-takingthat could result,'' said mr. moss, the author of ''when all else fails: government as the ultimate risk manager.''  in any case, goldman has certainly helped itself to government programs that were put in place to stabilize the financial industry. for instance, the bank has issued billions of dollars of bonds guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation. since march it has sold $3.4 billion worth without government backing.   and goldman's conversion to a bank holding company, executed at the height of the crisis, gives the bank access to money from the federal reserve. in exchange, goldman had to increase its capital, reduce its leverage and accept fed oversight.   many analysts predicted that switch would force goldman to rein in riskier businesses like proprietary trading and parts of its commodities operation. but goldman has largely carried on as usual. it has received standard exemptions that give it two years to comply with federal regulations governing bank holding companies.  ''they are very happy to go back to a business model that year-in and year-out has made them untold wealth,'' said john c. coffee, a professor of securities law at columbia university.  mr. cohn concedes that goldman, along with other banks, bears some responsibility for the ***financial crisis**. ''there's no performance angel in this,'' he said. but he bristles at all the fingers being pointed at goldman.   ''every bank has to accept a degree of responsibility, but it sometimes feels like we're being disproportionately blamed,'' he said. ",8/6/09,1,1,,,,1
